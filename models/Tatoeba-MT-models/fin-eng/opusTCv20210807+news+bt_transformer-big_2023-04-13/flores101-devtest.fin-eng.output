The U.S. Gymnastics Federation supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's letter and accepts the Olympic family's undeniable need to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the United States Olympic Committee's statement that in the best interest of our athletes, our teams and their sports, it would be better to move forward through meaningful change within the organization than by losing our status as a federation of sports.
The U.S. Gymnastics Federation is supporting a private investigation that can help understand how such blatant abuse as that bravely reported by Larry Nassar's victims can have gone undetected for so long. The federation also welcomes any necessary changes.
The U.S.A. Gymnastics Association and the U.S. Olympic Committee share the same goal – to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.
Through the 1960s, Brzezinski worked first as an adviser to John F. Kennedy and then in the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.
In the 1976 election, he served as Carter's foreign policy adviser and then succeeded Henry Kissinger as national security adviser (NSA) from 1977 until 1981.
As national security adviser, he assisted Carter in conducting world affairs diplomatically, for example at the Peace of Camp David in 1978, normalizing U.S.-China relations in the late 1970s, dealing with the Iranian revolution that led to the 1979 hostage crisis and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.

This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provided information not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
The animal's plumage, according to the researchers, was chestnut brown on the top and light or carotenoid-coloured underneath.
In addition, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed stem called a rudder, but do have other feather properties – such as barbs and shuffles – the researchers concluded that rudder is likely to be a later evolutionary developmental stage than these other properties.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for thermoregulation or mating. Even though it was the young dinosaur's tail, the researchers suggested the sample came from the plumage of an adult individual rather than the chick's downs.
Although it was the young dinosaur's tail, the researchers suggested the sample came from the plumage of an adult individual rather than chick downers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the main police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two policemen and wounding more than twenty people.
The provincial governor's office reported that nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected some Daesh (Isil) fighter was behind the attack.
They discovered that the Sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: all the stars in their system were found to be active due to luminosity and rotation, nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star associated with the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the less frequent polarity reversals occur in the star.

However, he added, "they should not be saddled with responsibilities beyond their level of development, responsibility and capacity."
The Baker-Hamilton Commission released its report at 12pm Greenwich time today.
The report warns that no one can guarantee that any kind of action will be able at this stage to stop the warring between religious sects, the escalation of violence or the drift towards chaos.
The report begins by hoping for an open discussion and consensus forming on U.S. policy in the Middle East.
The report is quick to criticise almost every aspect of the executive's current policy towards Iraq, calling for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be launched before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders from hostilities and restore diplomatic relations with its border neighbors.

The work was theoretical at first, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to observe the effects of tides between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the earth, causing the tide, so the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius dwarf ellipsigalax.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects the rest of dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy surrounds it as a kind of halo and consists of a large number of tiny particles.

Dr Tony Moll discovered drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal region.
In an interview, he said the new variant was very concerning and alarming because of the very high death rate.
Some patients may have been infected at the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them belonged to the hospital's health care staff.
An infected person can infect 10 to 20 close contacts during the year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all people with TB still appears low – 6,000 of South Africa's annual total of 330,000 infected.

Infrared images show the day-to-day temperature variations indicate they are likely to be caves.
They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day at night and warmer.
Their thermal behavior is not as uniform as in Earth's large caves, where often temperatures are fairly constant, but it fits in with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeology Task Force at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and an instructor at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France has traditionally not been high-tech: voters shut themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed slip of paper in an envelope on which they have marked the candidate they want.
After authorities confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot list.
French electoral law has determined the course of events with comparative accuracy.
In 1988, ballot boxes were ordered to be transparent so that voters and observers can prove that there are no envelopes in the box when voting begins and that no envelopes other than officially counted and authorized votes are added to the box.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each leg of the sequence of events. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under close supervision and following prescribed procedures.

In her second race, the grand prix, she qualified in 10th place in the women's seating category with a total time of 4.41.30, which was 2:11.60 slower than first-place finisher Claudia Loesch of Austria and 1.09.02 slower than ninth-place finisher Gyöngyi Dan of Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's seating group were unable to finish their descent, and 45 of the 117 skiers on Giant Slalom were not placed in the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Superintendent D.K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who raped a Swiss woman and found her mobile phone and laptop."
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the names of the accused.
Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road where the collision happened was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court ever since for the murder of her son.
He is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but the eyewitness evidence could be defaced, as his picture has been widely published.
The practice is common in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's legal system operates differently, and courts have held that publishing the images may be detrimental to an impartial trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists do seem to balance dangerously if they publish photographs of suspects etc."
The Crown Office, the public prosecutor's office in Scotland, which has general responsibility for the charges, has given journalists the impression that there will be no further comment, at least until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to run the way they did before the 1967 Mideast war.
Other topics discussed, according to reports, included the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel insists on a continued military presence in the valley for 10 years from the signing of the agreement. The Palestinian Authority only accepts this kind of presence for five years.
Forest rangers were to closely monitor shooters participating in the complementary pest control experiment, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Qualifying volunteers were recruited as a joint project of the National Park and Wildlife Service and the Australian Association of Sports Shooters NSW and as part of the shooting federation's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of parks protection and cultural heritage at the NPWS, said the four shooters selected for the first shootings received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly acknowledged the nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
A presidentially appointed delegation last month recommended the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country toward new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by elections that failed to take place, some of which were supposed to have taken place as early as 2011.
Overheating of malfunctioning iPods has been reported in about 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires as well as minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the accident involving 27 devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had told it of 34 other cases of overheating that the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the clearance "really unfortunate."
The earthquake hit the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. Greenwich time on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication that a tsunami was occurring.
A former Filipino policeman has held Hong Kong travellers hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza shot at travellers with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza was killed by gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went on to pursue a medical career.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in her idle days.
His research showed that giving the hormone speeds up the development of fetal lungs.
Xinhua announced the official investigation team's discovery Wednesday of two black boxes, or flight recorders.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on a two-moon night. A pretty unique case like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna was as crazy as me...maybe more so...I love her and will miss her...hope she's in a better place."
Before the federal parliamentary election in 2010, a survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted. The number of people opposed to becoming a republic in Australia had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Julia Gillard, prime minister of the Department of Supply, argued during the 2010 federal parliamentary election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four per cent of those surveyed shared his views and wanted Queen Elisabeth II to remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 per cent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 per cent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was due to take part in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness has been in doubt because of the pain.
He has not been able to take the pain-relief drugs because their use is prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February with various devices and software, and it was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are born, and specifically how the Earth came into being, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
The 53-year-old Cuomo's tenure as governor began earlier this year, and he signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jaw-dropping and ridiculous."
He is thought to be running for president in 2016.
The US aviation regulator claims NextGen is a system that allows planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older ground-based radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no additional transport and overground trains will not stop at Wembley. There will also be no parking and connecting parking services available at the venue.
Concerns over the lack of transport raised the possibility that the game would be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, detailed the evolution of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species had already evolved in two generations, although the sequence of events had been believed to take much longer. The reason was the mutual reproduction of the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the invasive species cactus cricket (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into small objects.
It can be pulled into a thin cord that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted images in books called "book paintings."
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make the meter yourself using the juice of red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (i.e. alkaline) the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the tested chemical shows the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the outer layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, toilets had to be flushed, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the Greek Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where women and men bathed at the same time in the same facilities.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To take a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet long.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. Getting around much easier and faster is the greatest thing the bike has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car and many other means of transport.
Underneath them come the more medium-sized felines, which eat medium-sized game from hares to antelopes and deer.
Then there are the many small felines (including detached pet cats) that eat small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds, whose numbers are much higher.
The secret of their success is the so-called ecological compartment. According to this concept, each feline has its own special function, due to which it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males, and sometimes up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming sisters and daughters of a large family.
These animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other large felines), and they are also very dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far and pull five times as strongly as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of large cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four felines know how to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not akin to the mellow roar of a lion, but more a phrase made up of grunted, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can catch them. Almost all of the animals preyed on by the ocelot are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals, that is, by the smell of prey, sniffing the ground where they have travelled.
Ocelots see really well in the dark thanks to dim vision and move really discreetly. They hunt by merging with their surroundings and then lunging at prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population it is from (for example, if it migrates across a mountain range or river or to a new island, so that it is not easy to migrate back), its environment is often different from before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors different, so in order to be a strong competitor the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, over time it begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will look so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which only means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans inhale, and they use carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis and shade.
We make our houses out of plants and we make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was a great beast of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
With more than 70 razor-sharp teeth lodged in its long jaws, plus an extra row of teeth on its palate, nothing that hit its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a branched tongue. Its diet included turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
Even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex couldn't have done it.
In fact, most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own quirky or unusual festive treats, such as wild boar, peacock, snails and a rodent called a nut mouse.
As another difference, the poor and women ate their food sitting on a chair, but the rich preferred to host joint banquets where they lounged on their sides as they ate their meals.
Meals in ancient Rome could not serve food that came to Europe only in later centuries from America or Asia.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, for example, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods and priests sought to fulfill the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called most holy, into which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurati were built in the temples.
The top of the tower was God's special sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was no less important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard, and the shops were nothing more than open-plan sales desks along the streets.
There were no extensive forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas it was said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and while travelling west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living on the island at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the film National Treasure, you might think the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true; although something has been written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" are written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence. The writing is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but what is known is that the large parchment document (it measures 29 by 3 to 4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up in the early days for preservation.
So it's likely that the entry was only added as a name tag, as it were.
D-Day, or the invasions and subsequent fighting, had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was in the possession of the so-called Vichy France, i.e. the French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders and by no means fought against them.
The Allies invaded the south of France on August 15, 1944, codenamed Operation Dragoon.
The US and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is common to a large group of people living and working together, to society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it kind of also defines the size of society.
Civilized culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from one generation to another, to a long-term cultural footprint, and to a greater degree of distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only part of which was Congress - on the basis of Confederate articles.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and in the absence of a national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the often uncooperative authorities of the states to enforce all of its regulations.
Nor did it have the power to change tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Changing the articles required unanimous approval from all states, and the states were so over-reliant on the central government that often their representatives were not present.
Along with the German national team, the Italian national football team is the second most successful in the world. It won the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsports.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians even compete in them in international matches and the Olympics.
With nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), Japan is the seventh largest island in the world!
Because Japanese islands are all over the place or as a group, Japan is often referred to as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan began to be known as early as the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed past mentioned the island, using the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan. It triggered a shift in the indigenous population's methods of grain production and hired Chinese laborers for its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, military forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1812) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a Qing Dynasty province in 1885.
After experiencing defeat in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, which saw it cede Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: these are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Room.
Most buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration continues even now.
For example, the most common size in the world for still images is 35 mm. It was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but above all, the image sensor formats of the digital camera have inherited its aspect ratio.
Somewhat confusingly, the 35mm size is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Therefore, this size aspect ratio (divided by twelve to give the simplest size ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and much derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamism in an image while still maintaining some order.
The most effective place for the main object is at the point where the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds cross (see example).
In this era of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
Christianity had been uniting European nations for more than a thousand years, despite differences in languages and customs.
Its all-pervading power affected all, kings and commoners alike.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's financial resources are intended for just such use.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question the realization of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital supplies to soldiers and civilians, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law that several international treaties had codified in the previous two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships entering entire ocean areas and posed a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the tactics provoked only limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolationism.
Nations, after witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the US with four cents, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous superior) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of describing different periods: each phase of China, or each family in power, was its own dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of provincial division. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year period of three kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought ferociously in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for access to sit on the highest seat of Xi'an's mighty palace.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the idea of nationhood and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, posts were also opened to all male applicants. Thus, the most ambitious and successful could succeed.
The same was true of the army, because military ranks were now based on capability rather than class status.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in things outside of everyday life, often meditating in a cave that became known as Hira and was located on the light-signalling Mount Nur.
The cave itself, left alone by the tooth of the time, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Situated in one of the mountains rising north of Mecca, the cave is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very hard to find, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
There is only a clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little about the earthly world.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx of Giza.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Necropolis, located in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign of the ascending bow looks like the letter V and the sign of the descending bow is like a rivet or square lacking an underscore.
A rising spring means you should start at the tip and push the spring. A falling one means you should start at the fross (that's where you hold the spring with your hand) and pull the spring.
The rising spring usually produces a softer sound, the descending spring is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to use a pencil to add your own markings, but remember that printed suspension marks are on the notes for musical reasons, so they should generally be followed.
A mob of working women forced a terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister Elisabeth of Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They came in carriages back to Paris as the crowd surrounded them and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages completely.
At some point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed at Versailles in front of the shocked queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay the war costs of conquering the Philippines for U.S. imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial administration to cover a substantial portion of the costs and to look after interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks in the name of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of US imperialism, of course, consisted of the gigantic profits made from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, you need to understand the background against which the organization was born.
The period of events is usually referred to as the Middle Ages, a period in European history between 1000 and 1300 AD.
The Heart Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that, in practice, covers a wide range of ideas about the so-called thrust of technology, or the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is guided by logic based on scientific laws and the technology they manifest.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two basic ideas: first, that the development of technology itself follows a route that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and second, that technology, in turn, has inherent rather than socially conditioned "impacts" on societies.
As an example, you could argue that the invention of the car would inevitably lead to the development of roads.
On the other hand, the nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to bring down the price of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars results in more accidents on the road, leading to the discovery of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major ingredient in romance and drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography was considered to shape individuals. Over time, customs and culture typical of this geographic location took shape. Since these were in harmony with society, they worked better than laws arbitrarily enacted.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 A.D. and continued until about 1100.
Its status declined in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than the Byzantine market's offerings.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the late 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication routes, styles in Western Europe could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the most significant developments of the era, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes with the Crusades.
Self-sufficient farming is farming where enough food is produced just to support the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficiency is a simple, often organic, system that uses seeds native to an ecoregion combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple ways to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel ostracized by societal norms, and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, place and/or gender of members.
Qualities that define a subculture as their own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexuality-related, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Often subculture members signal their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example the few unfortunate children who were deprived of the socialization provided by adults growing up, either through neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wild." Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, abandonment has been caused by parents rejecting a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are allegedly bred by animals, some said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a wild child is raised entirely by an animal other than man, he behaves (within his physical limitations) in almost exactly the same way as his custodian animals, for example, by showing the same fear or indifference to men.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting. Timely support of learning (scaffolding) goes one step further.
Ladder is not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A ladder can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is a small paperclip door in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladder is built into the software and is designed to ask questions, give prompts and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's help.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but some live.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, steady education and reliable health care.
The children's placement is intended to address all the basic conditions they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
In the case of purpose theory, the peculiarities of the Internet imply additional dimensions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences on Internet use (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new aspects of motivation when studying public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting microexpressions, or facial movements that last just a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks described how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behaviour.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic modification: latent and manifest.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, a choice to remove it from the reservoir of expressed variations.
Differentiation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two stocks with each generation.
The primate, which has a similar digestive system to a human, has a hard time getting enough amino acids from plants available on the savannah.
In addition, not having them has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and pea plants, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them without cooking.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible and rich in all essential amino acid proteins.
Thus, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their “protein problems” in much the same way as the chimpanzees of the savannahs do today.
Interruption of sleep is a deliberate awakening during a normal sleep cycle and falling back to sleep a little later (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This is easily achieved by using a relatively silent alarm clock, which restores consciousness but does not wake you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before bed, when you're forced to get out of bed to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person corresponds in the opposite respect to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive is his life force. It is possible for everyone to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but they added the concept of the mahajana, or Great Path, and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divinity yoga. Visualizing the deities clears energy channels, activates chakras and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States worked together. After the war ended, clashes of systems, procedures and cultures led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, previous allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was actually fought, as proxy armies fought on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
Poland's defences had already been broken by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganise at Romania's bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops advanced into the country and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland. This was contrary to the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The role of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that its own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy mostly tried with submarines to block this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
The goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually raised as herds that roamed the hilltop or other pastures. They were often cared for by goat herders, many of whom were children or young, such as the more well-known sheepherders. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways consisted solely of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull carriages faster and with greater loads than the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
The railway sleepers were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realised that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron strip on top of them.
The practice became common, but iron consumed more of the carriage's wooden wheels.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first all-iron tracks were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (or able-man) evolved.
The Australopithecus that preceded it did not walk upright as continuously.
Bipedalism can be found in Australopithecus's 4.2- to 3.9-million-year-old fossils, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can go about living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering somewhat.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we don’t want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a great deal as a result of the scientific and technical advances of mankind, and the problems have grown due to overpopulation and the wasteful way of life of mankind.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printer a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies, now known as Dunlap's open sheets, were printed during the night.
John Nixon first read the document out in public in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who allowed it to be read to his troops in New York on July 9. One copy made it to London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap open sheets known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern palaeontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. We call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers currently in use are based on the processing of information encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers – or bits in computer circuit jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Vomiting-like symptoms are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The surest characteristic of internal poisoning is a visible, opened medicine jar or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the label for first aid instructions for the poison in question.
Entomologists actually use the term bedbugs for this group of insects.
The term derives from the fact that in ancient times bedbugs have been very common. Bedbugs are insects that are well adapted to parasites in humans.
Bedbugs and bedbugs are both nest-delayed, adapted to life in their host's nest or enclosure.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis, or multiple sclerosis, in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice the tendency to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in the best interests of themselves or their child.
These couples may choose to prepare an adoption plan for their little one.
In adoption, biological parents waive their rights to parenthood, allowing one couple to serve as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to find out by scientific methods how the world works.
However, it's not just about conducting experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including the field of psychology.
As Greek language skills deteriorated in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in body structure and behavior often depend very substantially on the existence of internal cycles and their generation by biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been found in most living creatures, such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-perpetuating oscillators that continue to circulate freely for a certain period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the main indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments either labeling the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be inherited by children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature sites with the intention of enjoying the scenery – including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits and getting to know information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting orangutans in Borneo, learning from them and photographing them.
Every morning, residents of small rural towns take their cars to work, and they are met by others whose jobs are where they left off.
In this kind of dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is somehow connected to, and at the same time supportive of, a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that a huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the kind of stable state that has underpinned human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, as the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform manner. Thus, traffic flows tend to have a moderately good consistency and can be presented in a rough mathematical way.
In order to better describe traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships will help with road zoning, planning and maintenance.
Insects were among the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward against their bodies.
This allows them to have a wider range of small places to hide from the beasts.
Dragonflies and daisies are now the only insects that can't fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, which is that the entire Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, with more than 8 times more water than the second largest.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, at its widest point 6 miles.
20% of the water that flows into our oceans comes from the Amazon.
The actual length of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction skills of the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old at that time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 and is the smallest independent state in the world.
The Vatican City State uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Most people who work in the state also speak Italian as their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious services.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known ordinary chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because all of them occur in nature as themselves and because they are also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything consists of a combination of one or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter – in the same order, solid, liquid, gas and plasma – but he also theorized that they turn into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals, but there are also metals such as gold and silver.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that you could fit them into the point that ends this sentence by the trillions.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came to the market.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing have developed, the value and uses of the pencil have become more ostracized.
These days, messages are written on a computer screen, and you never have to pick up the sharpener.
One can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes around.
A fission bomb works on the principle that requires energy to form a nucleus made up of many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the core again releases some of that energy again.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which is why they tend to break apart from a minor or nonexistent nudge.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called its crust.
The moon's crust has a thickness of about 70 kilometers on the side visible to Earth and about 100 kilometers on the moon's reverse side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more dark sea areas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are primarily aimed at exploring what is behind people's behaviour or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
When leaders start to lead their previous peers, generally speaking, two different behaviors can form. At the other end of the scale is an attempt to stay "one of the dudes" (or the dirty ones).
Such a leader has trouble making unpopular decisions, keeping discipline, assessing performance, sharing responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person is molded into an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the group's successes and failures.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with slight differences.
Virtual team members act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local administration may not always understand this.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which all members report. The invisible team sets the requirements for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting systematic learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, a process in which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, which is why it narrows the field of study and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain lesions, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The proliferation of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our minds.
While AI is strongly perceived to be associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research tries to get machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent operation.
Examples include supervision, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to a client's diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These have become differentiated disciplines focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense just as it is built into a number of software applications for home computers and video games.
Class trips are an important part of teaching. Often the teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology offers a solution, i.e. virtual field trips. Students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a desk.
Sharing a field trip virtually is an excellent way to commemorate it and share experiences with future classes.
Each year, for example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital. The site is revamped annually, but old versions of it are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of the students' blogging experience, grammar and spelling are often sloppy, but the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Since the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to take pains to improve their writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to hiffle better with the world around them." The need to feed readership's interest inspires students to be witty and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can allow students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position against the background of other people's writing, as well as bring out their own perspective on the issue at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a plethora of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Farther south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the pristine, scenic Muskoka, among other places.
These and many other considerations create the impression of Ontario as a place that outsiders consider a paragon of Canada.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Indeed, the following demographic comparison surprises many: More African Americans live in the United States than in Canada as a whole.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of them, and by nature is like a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are sovereign states or part of France and are known as luxury beach destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it got a lot of wind under their wings in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women – All female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, are advised to say that they are married.
Wearing a ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too precious.
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause what they may perceive as harassment. It is not unusual for someone to follow suit, grab an arm, etc.
Be strict in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make advances justified!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 9th century BC by Berber fishermen, and was used as a strategic port by both the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids, whom they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the town as Dar-ul-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's least interesting shopping destinations in Morocco.
It's easy to find places in the old medina that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagines, clayware, leather goods, water pipes, as well as a wide range of trinkets, but all of that is meant for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano devastated Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city centre.
Goma is reasonably safe, but any expeditions outside the city require prior investigation to determine the current state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
The town is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano. You'll also find some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trackers in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The usual (local) fare is around 500 Congolese francs for a short drive.
When this is combined with its comparatively tricky location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, far-flung lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and there is an airport.
It was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites in 1990 because of the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the country's other cities because it has more of an Arab feel than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature areas, each of which supports different kinds of fauna and natural plants.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
The park charges a daily conservation and admission fee, as it does in all South African national parks.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card (wild card) to access either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the main destination for many tourists.
The procession of buildings that makes up Hong Kong's silhouette has been likened to a glittering bar chart that becomes best evident in the water at Victoria Harbour.
You can see the best of Hong Kong by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon port area opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban sprawl lies on a crowded filling land on the northern shore.
It was this place that the British colonizers took ownership of, and if you're looking for signs of the region's colonial history, it's a good place to start.
Sundarban is the world's largest mangrove forest area. It stretches 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on the Indian side is called Sundarban National Park.
But the forests are not mere mangroves; they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, about a third of which is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Indian tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those travelling east and to Jakar and Bumthang, leave between 6.30am and 7.30am.
Since buses within the region are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
There are small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy for most of the counties.
Carpool taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paroo (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge of the Oyapock River is a diagonal rope bridge over the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, it is 378 metres long, and it has two lanes three and a half metres wide.
Construction of the bridge ended in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the border stations in Brazil are estimated to be completed.
The Guarani were the most prominent of the indigenous groups living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters, but also practiced subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, who got by by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, once called the "Giant Province of India," was born as a result of an encounter between Spanish conquerors and the country's indigenous peoples in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three hundred years.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in Las Cañitas polo grounds in December.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
You can get news from the Argentine Polo Federation about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley often accepts credit cards and U.S. dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the Outer Islands, although UK and US currencies may be valid. To find out the current payment method, ask the owners in advance.
It is almost impossible to change the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands themselves, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reads.
There are no special rainy seasons and dry seasons: the amount of rain stays more or less the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials instruct to stay at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves, as well as 25 yards/meter away from other wildlife.
Bison, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack, although they may look very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing heavily scented foods and keep the camp tidy.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced an infamous naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships – German, American and British – refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser sank, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful gathering in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement led to the killing of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of sandy beaches because Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are located in three different areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific shore and continue from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and pohutukawa trees provide shade for most.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour in the affluent neighbourhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are at times congested with family beaches, and the coastline is lined with a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a multidimensional beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are a number of French wines worth trying, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved en route.
It's perfectly safe to drink local tap water, but those who are wary will find bottled water easy to come by.
The idea of a flat white type of milk coffee is alien to Australians. A small black coffee is known as an espresso, and a cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped cream instead of frothed milk. Tea is served without milk.
Cocoa matches Belgian standards. Fruit juices are pricey but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubic jellyfish can be found north of 1770 near beaches and estuaries from October to April. Occasionally they can also be encountered at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and likely to swim away from the scene.
Estuary crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
When booking in advance, the passenger gets peace of mind that they have somewhere to sleep when they reach the destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also maintain your booking if you need time to think about an offer or to obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, any changes and requests should be directed first through a travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp in the area, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to events, you need to arrive on time to get music near the campsite.
Keep in mind that even after the main stage musical performances are over, there may be places at the festival where music will continue to be played late into the night.
Some festivals have separate campsites for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in wintertime, check the location of the cabin, because passing through the ice makes some very terrible noise.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check terms and conditions).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money that customers spend. There are usually no windows and clocks, and finding exits can be difficult.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offerings to keep customers in a good mood – and in the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or very cold temperatures.
There's little friction on icy and snowy roads and you can't drive the way you would on tarmac.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to catch a car.
Snowfall or snow flying in the wind, as well as moisture or ice accumulated in vehicle windows, may also reduce visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually operates year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest attraction and, for many, the highlight of their visit.
Popularly, the word safari refers to travelling by land to view the magnificent fauna of Africa, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and the usual equipment is good enough to watch them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
Walking safari (also called bushwalking, camping safari, and hiking) means camping for either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 15 September 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics since it played host to the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation could be tricky.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with tickets usually costing around 7,000 yen.
In many hotels, it is possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or if you do not particularly care about ironed socks, you can try a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in other areas several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have doubts, you should consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Travellers can come across pests they are not used to in their local area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison and infect with diseases.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means the ability to buy products in certain places that are exempt from excise and sales taxes.
Travelers to high-tax countries may sometimes save substantial amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is home to the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway because it repeatedly traverses remote woodland.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: you'll be up against a lot of steep ups and downs, narrow driving lanes and steep bends.
The speed limits imposed are considerably lower than in previous and later sections – usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) – and their absolute compliance is even more important than usual.
Oddly, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds region.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria quite sleek and versatile, resembling those of southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are prepared year-round, and cherries and plums are popular toppings in the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you are looking for small but sturdy pastries, try one called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is commonly used in curries. In southern India and some other coastal areas of the peninsula, coconut milk is usually used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an upper concept covering a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But if the term is used without further definition, it usually refers to food originating in the central and eastern parts of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, with a big selection of simply flavoured dishes. Flavours favoured by Javanese include peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
The rider gets more stability from them, but they can involve safety concerns because the rider's feet might cling to them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his foot is caught in the stirrup, the horse may run away and pull after him. Some precautions can be taken to reduce this risk.
First of all, most riders wear heeled riding boots with a smooth and quite narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup strap to come off the saddle if a falling rider pulls it backward.
Cochamó Valley – Chile’s number one climbing destination, known as Yosemite in South America. The valley has a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
There are breathtaking views from the peaks. Climbers arriving from around the world are constantly forming new routes on its endless walls.
Skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves lowering snowy ground on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, plan entire vacations around a particular destination.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings of skiers were made in 5000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first leisure ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking skis: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski trekking or excursion skiing.
It is akin to alpine skiing-style camping or mountaineering, but it usually doesn't include one because the latter is sported on steep terrain, and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as like a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can go somewhat faster than on foot, but you only very rarely get on the same speed as when skiing on maintained tracks and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries. Under ordinary circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean filling out visa applications and passing passport checks many times over.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a unified state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to re-enter passport control.
When you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define all goods more than a century old as antiquities.
The definition varies by geographic location. In North America, for example, antiquities are counted as newer items than in Europe.
Craft products may be defined as antiquities, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important industry for the Sami people, and the culture associated with it is also important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami have participated in large-scale reindeer farming, but have lived off fishing, hunting and similar livelihoods and considered reindeer mainly to be draft animals.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sámiland.
Although the word gypsy is widely used, especially among non-Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and misconceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is covered by a travel notification, it may affect your travel health insurance and cancellation insurance.
You may want to seek advice from other states besides yours, too, although their advice is for their own citizens.
As one example, Americans may find themselves in different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The briefings are only brief summaries of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, generalized and oversimplified compared to more detailed information from elsewhere.
Dangerous weather is a general term for any dangerous weather event that may cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Dangerous weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, high rainfall and wildfires are the forms and consequences of dangerous weather, as are thunderstorms, cyclones, water columns and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal occurrences of hazardous weather include blizzards, ice storms and sandstorms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of hazardous weather affecting the place of travel as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone wishing to visit a country that could be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for a candidate for "A Hostile Environment Course" is likely to yield the address of a local business.
The course usually goes through all the topics discussed here in much more detail and usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts between two and four days, and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but publications about war zones are few.
Tourists planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
The willingness of authorities to issue passports with no gender (X), or update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who haven't had surgery shouldn't expect to survive security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the reversible flow of waves that break ashore. They are often found on reefs or similar places.
Because of the submerged topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and a rapid flow into deep water can form there.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which might be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than it usually is.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught out by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
Return shock strikes earlier than culture shock (the habituation phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Tourists who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their own home culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers needed to get used to the new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The Pyramids sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts you can see them in complete silence.
The story of light and sound is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the backdrop to a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are played out against the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
Many states have claimed the South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and have the largest number of bases. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of a still-operating volcano serves as a staggering natural harbour.
Ellsworth land is an area restricted by the Bellingshausen Sea to the south of the peninsula.
There, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau and then rise again to form the 360-mile-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota ice sheet.
In the north, or Sentinel Mountains, lie Antarctica's highest mountains, or Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson at its highest peak of 4,892 meters.
In remote areas where mobile phones do not have coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
There is usually no satellite phone as a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call you have to be outside and have unobstructed visibility into the satellite.
The service is often used in shipping, including on yachts. It is also used by expeditions that need remote connections of data and sound.
Your local phone service provider will probably be able to provide more information about connecting to that service.
Travelling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year.
It is particularly popular with school leavers because they can take a year off before university without their education being affected.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad can even improve the chances of continuing to higher education studies in your own country.
Typically, there is a course fee for participating in these tutorials.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. There are also thousands of islands in the country of thousands of lakes, both in the lakes and in the archipelagos along the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don’t necessarily need a boat the size of a yacht.
While the archipelagos and largest lakes along the coast are big enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, where there are boats for every seventh or eighth person.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in 40).
Most actual Baltic Sea cruises involve a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return for a night on board to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore on ship-arranged excursions (2009 status).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of a cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown or experienced something traumatic before.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from many other people’s own fears and dislike of other things.
For some, some insight into the operation of the aircraft and what happens during the flight may help to overcome the fear of ignorance or helplessness.
Transport companies are paid well for fast deliveries. Often speed is very important for the documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, it could take days to unload and clear cargo on some routes.
The only way to get the item through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines regulation doesn't allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, so at this point you're needed.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a big wad of cash for this privilege (or perhaps you'd rather let your firm do it for you).
However, it doesn’t come cheap: according to a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of business class and eleven times the price of first class!
For direct flights from A to B, generally speaking, you shouldn't even look for discounts on business class or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of airline passengers who are willing to pay malts to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
The conflict led to the 1994 declaration of independence by the Republic of Transnistria, based in eastern Moldova. It has its own administration and currency but is not recognized by any U.N. member state.
Economic ties have re-established between the two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third-largest city. It has a population of about 3.7 million people, is the country's second-largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and vibrant trading hub, surrounded by mountains and spread around a huge bay.
With wide boulevards, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres, there are traditional red-brick roofs, an 18th-century market and old mosques and churches, although the atmosphere of the city is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
Haldarsvík has an unusual octagonal church, and the village overlooks nearby Eysturoy Island.
The churchyard has interesting pigeon sculptures on top of some gravestones.
It is worth spending half an hour strolling around the fascinating village.
From there, to the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra. Foreigners will get to know it from the acclaimed account written by Lord Byron, in which he described its splendour.
ScottUrb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops in Cabo da Roca.
In the north, you should also visit the large shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, famous worldwide for her appearance.
Remember that you are practically visiting a mass grave and a site that is of almost immeasurable importance to a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who survived after being there, and many more whose loved ones were murdered there or forced to work themselves to death there, Jews as well as non-Jews.
Be sure to treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't deface the place by drawing or scrawling graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is the first official language by law.
Yet Spanish is also commonly used on public transport and other services.
The usual announcements on the metro are only in Catalan, but the automatic system reports unexpected disruptions in many different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant people.
Even though it is often just a stereotype that is inaccurate, the best way to get by in Paris is to be as decent as possible and act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). It makes getting around considerably easier.
The rude exterior of Parisians evaporates quickly if you show quite ordinary courtesy.
Plitvice National Park is rich in forest, featuring beech, spruce and pine trees, and its vegetation is a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean plants.
There is a remarkably wide spectrum of plant communities due to a wide range of microclimates, varying soils and elevation differences.
The area is also home to an extraordinary variety of animal and bird species.
Along with more common species, rare fauna such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and woodlands can be found there
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts covering their knees, and shoulders should also be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially a brightly colored one, you may get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men need to be dressed in below-the-knee pants.
You can borrow them from the wardrobe at the entrance too, but they're not washed after every wear, so you might not feel comfortable in these skirts. One size fits all men!
Like similar cuisines in the Mediterranean, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil for everything.
A simple popular dinner especially in summer is pa amb was: bread with olive oil and tomato and any available side dish, such as cheese or tuna.
All nouns, plus the word "Sie," or "te," always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It can also make reading easier, although writing is complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or adjective is used in a nounized form.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters C and G deserve the most attention, as their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also remember to pronounce r and rr differently. Caro means dear, carro wagons.
Persian grammar is fairly easy and mostly regular.
Therefore, reading this grammar book would help one to learn many things about Persian grammar and improve the comprehension of sentences.
Needless to say, if you know any Romance languages, then learning Portuguese is easier.
However, those who know little Spanish may have a precipitous idea that Portuguese is so close that they would not have to study it separately.
Today, old-fashioned observatories are not usually used for their original purpose, but have been converted into museums or learning environments.
Because light pollution was not the same problem in their glory days as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, and are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities and are located in far-flung regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
Cherry blossom viewing, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 7th century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was Japanese napricot.
In Japan, the emperor organized the first cherry blossom feast only for himself and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "just one" as a sample.
If you visit the official and manicured garden, you fly out of "samples" gathering without any buts.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, and it is very easy to find your way there. You can buy almost anything upon arrival.
But being in the heart of the tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to endure both heat (always) and intense sunshine (when the skies are clear, which happens less often).
In addition, some buses travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to board also goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Kiryat Arba Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan your holiday.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise to the towns of interest along the Danube, or boating in the Erie Canal.
They also determine the course of popular hiking and bike trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated on the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers and non-Christians in Christian countries around the world have also adopted many traditions related to the festival.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often deliver Easter Mass on the Saturday evening of Easter weekend. The congregation often breaks out to celebrate at the midnight hour to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island came there by swimming, flying or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals were unable to survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main grass-eating animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience a polar night when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky is dark around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore not a problem, you can also admire the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners may have been used to.
Costumes are standard work attire, and colleagues call each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is absolutely essential. Instead of personal achievements, the emphasis is on teamwork.
Employees often have to get a supervisor’s approval for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the supervisor’s instructions without complications.
