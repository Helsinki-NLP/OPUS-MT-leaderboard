Eemeli Kouki leads Hurricane home win in opener - Savo Volley wins second
Seven times in a row, Hurricane Loimaa started the 2018-19 season with a 3-0 win at home, while Raisio Loimu went down 3-0 on Saturday.
All-rounder Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was most effective for the Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tune-ups abroad, but they didn't materialize, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
Things were settled pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpunen, who played like Kouk in Loimu, backed Kouk with 18 points.
The most powerful of the visitors was national chipper Samuli Kaislasalo, who plays on a match-by-match contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
A lot of players had experience on the other side as well, and that brought additional extras to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but extending the medal streak is obviously the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley 's
Miro Määttänen had 18 points to be Savo Volley's most effective as the team thrashed the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was erratic especially on the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze in the win.
I didn't have any conscious different charge when I was playing against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career with Vieremän Volleyball in the 3-series in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
Good luck with the home opening.
Miro was king, Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala’s previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi Sampo while Tuovinen was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was most effective for the Ducks with 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league standings in 2012-13, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley picked up his season-opening win after downing the Tigers 3-2 in Kokkola.
The season has started well for me.
It was a close loss today, of course, because we were down 17-21 in the fourth set.
The fifth one came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The most effective of the Tigers, who were still in the standings a few seasons ago, was chipper Edvarts Buivids, who scored 28 points.
Compatriot Aleksandrs Kudryashovs backed up with 17 points.
He didn’t get much of a grip on the guy’s chipper, Mikkonen boasted.
Finland ranked number one in the world in human capital comparison
Finland is leading the world in the comparison of human capital, according to the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands finished one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst.
In measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population are examined.
The World Bank has stated that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was stretchered off into a brace of brilliance, and the Madrid teams' local game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish soccer league.
Atletico Madrid forwards Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to a goal, but Belgian keeper Courtois made the save.
Courtois played for Atletico for three seasons on loan when he was a Chelsea player.
Early this week, he was selected goalkeeper of the year by the International Football Association (Fifa).
At Real, the best place to score was Gareth Bale, but his shot headed past goal late in the opening half.
Bale missed the break after being substituted with a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real supporters chanted the name of goal-cannon Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus in the match.
U.S. Now Attacking Abortion Rights: A Powerful Documentary Explains Why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, could be chosen as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party are hoping that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will reverse the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the U.S. in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights chronicles how things have come to pass over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also topical in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (Sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of Finnish MPs.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, we meet Colleen McNicholas, a gynecologist who has remained the only doctor in Missouri to perform abortions.
An armed guard at the clinic says he defends U.S. religious freedom.
News videos are a reminder of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At the time, a consortium of Lutheran churchmen guided women to trusted abortion doctors.
The interviewee’s arguments are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died from a self-imposed abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year in the United States.
The legalization of abortion was championed by the Republican Party in particular.
As early as 1967, the California Abortion Rights Act was signed into law by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign of 1980, who began to conflate religion with politics in order to reach out to voters.
His abortion stance was also reversed by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document goes to the heart of the matter in its search for a basis for the politicization of the abortion issue.
When segregationist religious organizations were denied tax-exempt status, they became politically active.
They chose abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
As of this writing, the US is in a situation where the president, who boasted of his sexual harassment and has captured the votes of the religious right with his abortion stance, has chosen Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by several women, as a Supreme Court nominee.
Kavanaugh could gain the power, based on the scales, to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots dead 7 Palestinians, including 2 children - in large protests along border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in the past six months as Israel has fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot dead seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Health Ministry says.
Among the dead are two children: 12- and 14-year-old boys, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
The ministry said 505 people had been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli military has confirmed that it opened fire and carried out an airstrike on the border zone as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says it has begun using force to ensure that protesters do not break down the border fence or seek to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations along the border.
The number of wounded is 12,000, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The protesters demanded Palestinian families be given access to areas Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balloons sent from the Palestinian side have set fire to forested areas and farmland in Israel.
He got a penalty kick and couldn’t shoot himself.
Wigan top-half Chey Dunkley appeared to have brought him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed play to continue.
His interpretation was that the tackle was clean.
Santa couldn’t believe his eyes.
I think the situation remained troubling for referee Ward, who awarded Norwich a penalty in the 85th minute when Pukki was brought down.
Ward showed penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic jolted a 1-0 winning goal.
Pukki has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The former was born last Saturday against QPR with an elegant chest muscle.
Worked for Santa again.
Having lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
It was the fifth game in two weeks for Norwich.
The team will continue in the League Cup.
There's a five-win streak at the back.
Paedophile helpdesk immediately filled with reservations - about 40,000 people in Finland feel interested in children
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-teens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
Until now, it has been difficult to get help for those who are sexually interested in children or adolescents.
The SeriE project, a joint project of the Criminal Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet paedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, began to receive an email flood and appointment times were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.
The majority of those who notice paedophilic feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did not do anything criminal.
But preference is usually a permanent quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says Yle’s sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Korean leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize - it may sound strange, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the talk level, to commit to denuclearization.
The biggest favorites to win the Nobel Peace Prize, based on the odds, are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to pursue a peace deal between their countries.
The warming of the inter-Korean relations is remarkable, as they were still chilly last year.
Yet rewarding Mr Kim, who has spent years bracing himself for nuclear weapons and leading his country with an iron fist, would no doubt also attract criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced from Monday, with the most high-profile, or peace prize, on Friday.
If the prize is not given to those involved in diplomacy on the Korean peninsula, Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege is one of the top contenders.
A respected gynaecologist in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), he has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape and has become a world-leading expert in his field.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, a gruesome byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN refugee agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel committee has said there will be 331 nominees for the prize this year.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind getting a Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world," the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
But there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides the prize, has often credited individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - exactly the kind of international cooperation to which Trump has been seen as an adversary.
In the 2000s, three U.S. politicians have received the award, all of them Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological about-face by the Nobel committee.
Fire report in tunnel: Motorists acted like lemmings and drove the wrong way
The traffic chaos on Route 1 occurred on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department sought to bring traffic back to normal.
But it didn't work out very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it could not be opened because there was a shock of motorists on the road and they were driving as it happens,” the fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
At the time, we were driving in the wrong direction after waiting for a few minutes.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow, says Tapio Heiskanen, Liaison Manager at Liikenneturva.
Traffic regulations state that you must stop on motorways and tunnels only for a compelling reason.
The Finnish Transport Safety Agency points out that in exceptional situations, you cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always provide the most accessible access possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making and reversing a U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as of course is parking.
There have even been cases recently where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activity in question, Heiskanen says in a statement issued by Liikenneturva.
Ilves fans would have loved to have continued their celebrations even though the ship was caught on the lake bed
The Ilves fans transported by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been stuck to the lake bed by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's captain at the time of the incident.
On the way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, M/S Tampere drifted away from its route late on Saturday night and got caught in the bottom of its bow at Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the incident.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the ship until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them by fire service to the port and by bus home, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch Ilves and HPK play, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, the Saturday haveri was due to the water level in Vanajavesi being about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with seagull droppings, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn evening.
Not a better collision.
Haveri took place on the western side of the narrow Jumuse Strait shortly after the ferry route had crossed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama to the incident, as the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the incident and hitting the bottom did not cause a more noticeable collision.
According to Syrjä, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or indentations on the ship, and the ship’s cruises are expected to continue as normal.
The diver visited on Saturday morning to check the condition of the ship before the ship began to be towed out of the shallows.
As a precaution, we will still visit the shipyard to check that no damage was caused, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere’s next cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season, he said, will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
Emergency services were alerted to the incident on Saturday evening shortly after 12:30.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to accept evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Fire Chief Matti Willman, who is on duty, said late last night that evacuation conditions on the lake were tricky because of darkness and fairly high winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after 3:30 a.m. on Sunday that everyone on board had been evacuated and that the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump Judge Nominee Accused of Harassment and Boozing May Miss Out on Top Office
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh may well miss out on the post he is seeking, program director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy Studies said.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault and inappropriate behavior during his student days.
According to Aaltola, the doubts have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up portraying someone else for the post.
In the United States, it has occasionally happened in the past that the president's nominee to be a Supreme Court justice has stirred up plenty of controversy.
In this case, the candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to preserve his face.
Nomination would rain down on Democratic laurels
The U.S. Supreme Court tends to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the selection of a new judge has become a politically very delicate process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aaltola said, the decision will likely rain down on the Democratic Party's laurels in the upcoming midterm congressional elections.
That would raise voter enthusiasm among young people and women, who would be more likely to vote Democratic.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative justice to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity to be appointed does not occur every presidential term, as Supreme Court justices in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at the age of 70-80 at their own request.
Even some Republicans are hesitant about the nomination
The U.S. Supreme Court nominees are normally subject to background checks, Aaltola says.
Even though Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI’s further investigation, it can still bring up something important.
Yes, it might.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
What is certain, Aaltola said, is that Kavanaugh's fitness or unfitness for office will still be the subject of lively debate before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
Most embarrassing of all, the nomination would be carried to a vote and Republicans would lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told public broadcaster the BBC that she identifies the Russian man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of Russia's military intelligence agency.
The woman said from the photographs it was Anatoly Tshepiga, who works in military intelligence at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier they had revealed one of the two men suspected of the poisonings as Tshepiga.
Already, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities are undercover.
The BBC team travelled to a village in the Far East near the Russia-China border where Mr Tshepiga grew up.
A woman in the village recognized the young Tshepiga from photos released by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from pictures of British police featuring a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the Hero of Russia award in 2014.
Russia still denies a suspected GRU link.
In an interview with Russian television in September, the men suspected of the poisonings said they had been tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly in tossing bags in health and social care reform
Now we have a vivid example of what the change restriction of the health and social services reform defined by the Sipilä Government means in practice.
The health and social services of my municipality of birth, Vaala, are produced by Oulunkaari joint municipal authority, of which Attendo’s former regional director has been elected as the Director of Health Services in 2016.
Local authority leaders are warning the council against the change limiter.
If spending on health and social services rises now, local government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The municipal centre decision-makers were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would end institutional care in the health centre’s inpatient ward and a small unit for people with memory disorders.
Home health care would be increased, which means elderly people living in remote villages in Vaala will be uprooted next to a health centre to be "at home" treated.
Attendo relied on the municipality to pay for its customers.
The Left of Vaala did not swallow the poor preparation, but organised a good public event, which was attended by many relatives, local nurses and also councillors from other parties.
I presented the social and health services preparation with slides on how Vaala municipality is already treating the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighborhood councilwoman, Carina Läntinen.
The local paper made a big story about the occasion, and it put the Oulunkaaren preparers on the back foot again.
The health and social services preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The draftsmen only talk about service vouchers, but they do not say what level of care it will provide or what staff structure Attendo will use to care for the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
The hospital is closed because there is no doctor’s office.
Attendo will also rely on Vaala Health Centre’s doctors.
Vaala's example is about how centrist officials run councillors with incomplete information and councillors get their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party clears Vaala of residents, as who will remain there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was it one of the election slogans of the centre that the whole country is kept populated?
Turkish President Erdogan opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people protested as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the country, opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River since early morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read the protesters' placards, and the slogans denounced fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security has been tight.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest Turkey's human rights record, among other issues.
Supporters of Mr Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
But police had cordoned off a large area around the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan boasted that his visit to Germany had been a success and judged that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met twice with Chancellor Angela Merkel.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
But Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the two countries on issues including human rights.
Review surrounds visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia state Premier Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he came to the anti-Erdogan rally from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and demoted.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin.
Three charged in Slovakia journalist's murder
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
A prosecutor said Friday that three people are charged with the Feb. murder of Kuciak and his fiancee, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in connection with the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot to death in February with his fiancee at his home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the killings are connected to Kuciak's investigations.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of Karelian on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to a printing error, Sunday's Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the paper in sparsely populated areas, where distribution to communal boxes has to be carried out from memory.
It was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem may still persist on Monday.
Mailing puts extra bundles of newspapers in the province.
Magazines for subscribers from the rest of Finland will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these newspapers is greatly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Today, journalist Arto Nyberg will interview Vesa Heilala, among others, live on his upcoming talk show.
Vesa is in the studio to talk about his upcoming trip to space, which he booked with Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan.
Had the original plans been correct, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unfortunate test flight in 2014 and one that even claimed a fatality, things are looking up.
If all goes well, commercial flights will still start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that his journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight will last 2.5 hours and the weightless space will be 5 minutes at an altitude of 100 kilometres, the Finnish astronaut says on his upcoming website.
At the same address, he also backs his yearning for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw the "Star Trek" series on TVs.
We've seen Star Wars and that's what left the idea smoldering...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City were rude hosts
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League when they thrashed Brighton 2-0 on home soil on Saturday.
The sixth win of the reigning champion team's season was guaranteed by goal injectors Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when he was found by Leroy Sané on the back post of Brighton's goal in the 30th minute.
Agüero upped his own goal balance to five when he saw off the Brighton defence with Sterling to pieces in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentinian was able to place a 2-0 final score at the penalty spot with ease.
With six wins and one draw to start the season, City lead the Premier League with a haul of 19 points.
Liverpool, who have played one game less, are lurking just one point away, however.
Liverpool will face series three Chelsea in their own seventh-round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At their meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Clubs elected new decision-makers for their next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme were elected as the Chair and Vice Chair respectively.
The council elected 40 full members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Clubs announced on Sunday.
The youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In its three-year operational goals, the Youth Society Meeting in Joensuu makes three promises: We will keep the doors open to everyone, and we will organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Clubs says in a press release.
JUST IN: Lewis Hamilton hails Kimi Raikkonen and astounds Ferrari: 'Losing a very important driver'
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Raikkonen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points in the World Championship standings.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Raikkonen would not continue with the team next season, while Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Naturally, Hamilton doesn't think Raikkonen will hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He will remain one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Raikkonen has been one of his role models.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian leg.
Starting from pole position for the race at 2pm will be Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas.
The evening paper follows the race moment by moment.
Football's A-junior SM-series championship battle became a total farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top tier of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the 1 p.m. round, the starting point for the championship was clear: FC Lahti Academy has enough room for one point against Vasa IFK.
To turn things around in the final round, the Ilves, who are second in the championship battle, need to win PK-35 and hope for a loss in the Bay Area.
However, the Lahtinen championship was confirmed in practice even before the starting whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less player, the match would not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the game 16-0.
At the break, the Bayers led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played some of the same players in the A-juvenile SM-series, i.e. the P20-series and the men’s Kakkonen C-section.
IFK has played against relegation in practice all season.
In the final round of round two on Saturday, Vasa IFK will have to beat JBK in an away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United lose their own away game against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the emergency services, luck was involved
The passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on its roof in Eno on Juttuvaarantie at around 9am on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the emergency services said.
Good luck was involved, the statement said.
Emergency services said the road was wet from the rain.
A police patrol attended the scene of the crash.
Supo expects new means of inquiry: Equipment purchases and recruitments have already been made, no hints of operations planned abroad
According to Suppo’s Chief Antti Pelttar, preparations for the Intelligence Act have been made by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
When the intelligence laws enter into force, the Supo budget would be permanently increased by approximately ten million euros.
The protection police (supon) premises on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already preparing for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Suppo’s chief from the National Coalition Party, tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence-gathering powers.
Serena Williams shocks with video of her singing topless - campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugs again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of her singing solely with her hands in front of her breasts, reports the AFP news agency.
The song is a 1991 hit by Australian band The Divinyls, I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Breast Cancer Society of Australia.
"I voted for The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly do self-help [breast] checks," Williams writes in her Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable position, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is all about the a's and o's - it plays into the lives of many.
Co-author of The Divinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments on the video, Williams is praised for her courage.
Williams opted out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is the uproar at the United States Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired up at the match's head judge and, among other things, argued that much more drastic behavior is accepted from men than from female players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain path not suitable for altitude frights
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has opened in China's Zhejiang province.
It is literally located on a cliff ledge.
If you want, you can look at the forest below.
Steep landscapes at high altitudes make restaurant visitors gasp in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19.9.2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restroom is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires a good base condition, the site says.
The end of the alleyway today: This is how it all ends
All good things come to an end.
Today, that's what happens to the domestic country drama Korpelan alley running, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season has gone down like hot rocks: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television for the first time.
The top figures in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no follow-up to the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen series.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirkku’s relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska’s mother seems to be the first to guess what’s to come.
The relationship between Anssi and Miisa is warm and romantic in the light of recent events, but then Laiho appears once again.
Police are also suspicious of the man.
However, no one can predict the fate of the ship in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets some incredible news.
Kauko's last will comes out, bringing the woman to the brink of tears.
A week later, on Sunday evenings, Sorjonen continues with new episodes.
Korpelan alley running today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
Flu season is hotting up.
Lots of people want to stay home or not.
However, the worker mole should consider whether it is worth it to go out and infect others, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping up.
In the latter option, you may already be infecting others, even if your own symptoms seem small, reports the Prevention publication.
So is it worth staying at home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person themselves has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted the day before symptoms begin and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may be more likely to transmit the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough subsides and the fever is no more, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Going back to the gym too quickly will slow down the recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, blow on a handkerchief, and throw your snotty papers in the trash.
Painfully moving, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not contain viruses, but keeps the wearer aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth," says Poland.
Sneezing is also limited to wearing a mask.
So how can we avoid infection?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats pageant tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Hockey player and misses are often linked.
That was the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The winner of the 2018 Miss Finland crown is Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina’s mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school for her father's Russianness.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
I had no friends in Pertunmaa,” Alina says at the announcement of the Miss Finland semi-finalists.
After high school, Alina decided to start fresh and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the pageant beauty found new friends and the day-to-day life started to roll as hoped.
At the age of 15, you think you’re an adult, but when you think about it, I’m not.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Joonas Hurri, who is familiar with Pelicans.
After a career in the SM-liiga, the hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish team for the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived for almost a year in a remote relationship, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I were to get into the winning trio and then have a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, trust works well for us, and the good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the initial spark stays with us all the time, Alina grinned in May.
Joyful of continuous growth, death upon our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth's resilience.
Yet, there is almost nothing to give up.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continued growth, but even the theory of the moderate economy runs into big problems.
Over a few generations, the continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, a standard of living that once could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-term overshooting of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are making the cornerstone of this market economy falter threateningly.
Two men were stabbed in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4 a.m. on Sunday night.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born in 1968, was less seriously injured.
The older of the men has already been released from the hospital.
One person has been taken into custody by police, whose possible role in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for a second suspect in connection with the incidents.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
Important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach fretted over mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter earned the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished off a 1-1 tally in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through on the right-hand side and, with luck, lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the away draw, the Mariehamn residents reached the gap to the Turun Palloseura, which is in the place of the series runners-up, for two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted, however, that the team did not engage in the kind of combat he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the Turku goal brought us stronger into the game.
John Allen, head coach of home team Inter, said the game was in control but scoring again brought pain.
One defensive miscue took the full score out of us, Allen fretted.
Again, we were the best!
Finland has the most human value in the world
Finland is ranked number one in a comparison of 195 countries.
The survey measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if measured by human capital.
Finland ranked first in the survey, which measured citizens’ health, education and learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published in The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
Countries on the continent took the seven worst positions in the comparison.

Lehterä showed his underachieving skills, position not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong underachieving came to the fore when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final preseason practice game.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
Over the past few days, the issue has been raised over suspected drug abuse.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug trafficking ring, some suspected of drug use and others suspected of selling drugs.
Lehterä has denied committing the crime.
The club and player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the incident.
Sam Carchidi of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who follows the Flyers closely, estimated after the game that Lehterä is part of a group of six forwards, five of whom will get a spot on the NHL team.
In the training match, Lehterä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second period, Lehterä fought the puck to himself with an underwhelming effort, drew a defender at him and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open slot.
For the second time, the duo's partnership brought a goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on Oct. 4 with an away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Vaakanainen is awaiting a decision from the team's coaching management on whether he will be included in the NHL group.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now it's up to the coaches to decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Libra said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
He played 19.31 minutes against Philadelphia.
On Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and deflected 20 times.
Fly-back defenseman Vili Saarijärvi scored to force overtime for Detroit as the team downed Toronto 5-1.
Calgary's Ilves-raised, defenseman Juuso Välimäki had an assist, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalie Mikko Koskinen, among others.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played a good 20 minutes and assisted on a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defenseman Markus Nutivaara assisted on his team's consolation goal midway through the closing period as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
On the losing goal Joonas Korpisalo saved 23/27 pucks.
More than 180 000 responses to the time of day survey
Citizens have responded actively to the survey concerning the decision on Finland’s future time.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply winter or summer time has already attracted more than 180,000 responses.
The survey opened in the Otakantaa.fi service can still be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time frame as the other Nordic countries, Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent photo shows the change: The world's fittest man lost dozens of pounds
Eddie Hall, who was crowned the world's strongest man in 2017, is undergoing a striking transformation.
British man Eddie Hall hunted for the title of world's strongest man long and determined.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories worth of food a day and weighed 200 pounds at his peak, according to the Mirror.
The shirts were a size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size," Hall said.
The Briton went on the hunt to win the World's Strongest Man race by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram of him posing in significantly slimmer shape than his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now works out five times a week aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson from the Icelandic TV series Game of Thrones weighed in as the strongest man in the world.
The previous Finnish winner of the race was Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Standing on a rock"
The inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday night at Akaa in Pyhäjärvi.
Emergency services were alerted to a water traffic accident on Friday evening after half past 12.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has hit the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks, said the firefighter on duty, Matti Willman.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members were on board.
Emergency services said injuries were avoided.
Passengers and nearly all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere, the duty manager Jari Nieminen told STT after 1 a.m.
Ambulances were called to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumuse Strait.
Police are investigating the cause of the incidents.
Matti Willman, the fire marshal on duty, said earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake were tricky because of darkness and fairly high winds.
Emergency services said the fate of the vessel was unclear.
Apparently, the ship is not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers start to check what the situation is at the bottom.
Built in 1957, the M/S Tampere is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship, with a maximum allowable passenger capacity of 180 people.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' fight tonight against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Today, Ilta-Sanomat reported on a challenge application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged a total of well over 80,000 euros in unpaid management fees, including late payment interest.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We have tried to mediate, but there is no other option.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius’ current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to Iltalehti, stating the boxer’s view of the events.
Helenius denies that it is obliged to pay the sum claimed.
According to Vastine, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised that they would be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for her.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay fees for only percentages of its matches.
It was repeatedly asserted that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only receive income arranged by them.
This is also the standard and only practice in professional athlete management.
Salary work has never been agreed upon, and this would have been absurd in Helenius’ situation,” Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement to cooperate.
According to the reply, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not receive the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal to be poor on his own behalf and broke off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once in his dealings with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the collaboration ended, Helenius had been shown an "unique but sizeable" bill for the manager's work.
A lawsuit has been filed this year with the same allegations.
Helenius considers Helminen’s and Kokkila’s after-actions cowardly, the reply states.
Helenius will face Boxing Federation IBF heavyweight contender Erkan Teper in Stuttgart today.
A hearty man and a good journalist
Ilkka "Ile" Vainio, an entertainer and music producer, knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Erkki Pälli, a long-time radio host and journalist, passed away at the age of 83 from terminal liver cancer.
The host's death notice was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The notice says Pall died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the news of the acquaintance’s fate.
He said goodbye on Facebook earlier, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll to be a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Pälli was a well-liked person with quick jokes and funny things.
I got to know Erk as a boy when I first visited Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a stockman.
We met with Erik.
At the time, he was Finnlevy’s publicist and held various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I started making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular journalist at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see what a big fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight into the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
He became known to many as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote excellent newspaper stories.
Erik has interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärki in the Fazer label.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's records.
Pällinen’s greatest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in the ether of Yle.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced Saturday that the federation's fiscal year, which ended in May, showed a profit of about 450,000 euros.
The union describes its financial situation as having undergone a "full turnaround," although the economy is of course burdened by "significant debt on the balance sheet."
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the quick response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible by taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management has been implemented throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement, and in the past competition period, the return on the World Cups was maximum.
However, in the future, too, cost control must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also being treated for aftershocks outside.
One of those who moved around the hospital grounds was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old from Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him last time when he was going to school," Baharuddin told AFP news agency.
In the courtyard of the army hospital in Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake began.
The family had been invited to the Return wedding party.
I was probably pinned under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told The Associated Press, according to British media.
Small shops being looted
At the Palu evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the mood in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many Palu residents have slept outside or in makeshift bamboo huts.
Even if the home were somehow standing, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the occupants beneath.
The Associated Press reported that more than half of the inmates at the Palu prison escaped after the prison's walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 deserters.
Some of the prisoners at Donggala prison have also escaped, according to The Jakarta Post.
The newspaper said the inmates became enraged and set fire to the prison after guards told them not to go looking for their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu airport has reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land in the field was a military C-130 transport plane bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport will only be allowed on a limited basis.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without the help of air traffic control, as the control tower was badly damaged by the earthquake.
Rain sweeps across Finland at night
A long area of rain will spread over the whole country from the direction of the west overnight on Sunday, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The rain will mostly come as water, but sleet or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The previous night's frigid frosts are not about to be repeated because under cloud cover temperatures will remain higher.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures under control.
In the West, it can be temporarily frosty, said Ville Ilkka, the meteorologist on duty.
On Sunday, the rain area will give way to the east through the morning.
To the south and west it will be pouty or partly cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week will look similar in terms of temperatures in southern and central parts of the country, but the weather will become more unsettled.
Wind and wave warnings are in effect for marine areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise the weather will be changeable.
Autumn is really starting to kick in now, Ilkka said.
Miss America will not be on TV.
From IL-TV you can watch the glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti’s entertainment journalists will broadcast live on IL-TV from the Miss Finland final red carpet in Billnäs.
The broadcast will begin at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from the ten finalists.
The final of Miss Finland 2018 will be held at Billnäs Ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the finals start, you can watch the atmosphere from the spot on IL-TV's live broadcast.
Live coverage will begin at approximately 6:30 p.m. and continue for approximately one hour.
This year’s finalists include many of the previous Miss Finland winners.
In the jury they are represented by the 1998 Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus.
Other jury members include wellness entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kauppa Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping she'd go to college before she went to the pageant.
Russian father Dimitri and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Recently Miss Finland Alina Voronkova’s parents Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova proudly watched their daughter’s first moments with a crown.
They went to the park and were going to drive back home after the final.
I love the atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result I was very nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that when she was little, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than a pageant career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should start being a pageant.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina became enthralled with beauty pageants.
My parents wanted Alina to go to university before she entered the Miss Finland competition.
That was the case, and in the end, Alina still wanted to do a bachelor's degree before the pageant.
We already asked him last year why he wouldn't attend, but he wanted to finish that bachelor's.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults too.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthily.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey in Japan for a living and couldn’t come to Finland to cheer on his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe the young people's relationship will last a pageant year.
Yes, it is meant to be!
The parents hoped their daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long hiatus in visits now because of the pageant rushes.
I miss you even though there are messages.
A young man was killed in a hit-and-run; police arrested three people.
Police said three people have been taken into custody as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intent of the hit-and-run, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also did not comment on whether the two men and the man killed in the hit-and-run knew each other.
Further information on the case will not be available until early next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - an idea from a comic book popped into her mind: lack of drawing skills didn't slow her down
In the past, the organic fool started from my husband’s statement, where he suggested it for a story I had developed as a person, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator who worked in Brussels on economic and legal issues until after her fourth child, the family became returnees ten years ago.
I enjoyed being a housewife very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what you would do when you were growing up, when even the smallest child was getting big.
Then, in 2014, a cartoon came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these scripts started to emerge, the situation changed.
At first, I wrote dozens of scripts in a drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I couldn’t get her to join me until the summer of 2016, when I gifted Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying, laughs Piippo, who says that the record was a great encouragement to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try and get something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on paper, Piippo says about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does in the evenings.
Manuscripts pop into my mind all the time, but I usually don't do it all at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and like to play with colours.
It's always the hardest to start drawing because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Dilbert by Scott Adams, among other things.
The characters of the organic fool are a carrot-body mother with a salad-haired pehko.
The other characters are Male, Pissis and Gemini.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The show's ideas come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a forced bun, even though the organic fool is sometimes pushing the issue.
She says she will read the series to her husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon that you're drawing and you say, this is what I've done today.
There are enough challenges for a housewife.

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - leaving no cracked tower, before getting hundreds of passengers to safety
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old air traffic controller, has emerged as the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from the earthquake-shaken island.
The youngster was on duty at air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the town of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While the others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to guide the Batik Air passenger jet from the tarmac into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives," the Indonesian Federal Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower shuddered and cracked.
In the end, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal organ injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility but passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight got airborne, eventually measuring 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia's Federal Aviation Administration has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn on ending Europe’s trade war: “We need to watch the next tweet”
The trade war between the United States and China is mirrored throughout the world economy.
Growth forecasts have been lowered throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Olli Rehn, President and CEO, said on Yle’s first morning that although the rising tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies’ investment decisions.
This also applies to the exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn believes that Europe is well on its way.
It has been able to build a truce with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn’s view, Europe does not seem to be grinding under the weight of a trade war.
I'll have to take a look at the next tweet and assess after that.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in the direction of Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, which is also one of the most indebted nations in the eurozone and the western world as a whole.
Markets reacted sharply yesterday to the markedly deficit-plagued budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday night.
Next year's shortfall will be more than 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem loans and more than ten per cent is non-performing loans.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country again appears to be exceeding its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
It might not be worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied, when asked if Italy was taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue affecting Europe is Britain's exit from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in harmony.
A contentious separation would have far more negative effects.
Rehn took over as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year.
The debate over his successor has begun.
The names of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have flashed in speeches.
I don't mind if there are Finnish names involved," Rehn said, adding that he would not comment beyond that.
HS’s super popular Black Box shows will resume next week – last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box shows organized by Helsingin Sanomat will resume this week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On 23 October, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre on sale.
Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold at Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage will tell a long-prepared true story that has not previously been published in any medium of HS.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard of.
"There's a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, impressive reportage from the other side of the globe and a telling story about a very current health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already been to the stands.
The Black Box was awarded journalistic act of the year at the Bonnier Gala.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to be close to their readers.
The Black Box of the spring 2019 season will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The show at that time has a different content than the evenings of this autumn.
Missing sponger found thanks to 'unprecedented experiment'
Finnish police know-how on drones is world-class: "We are asked for trainings"
According to the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, police can use drones to search for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance missions.
Police in Oulu were able to find the missing sponger in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a couple of minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that "through unprejudiced experimentation and effective education, we are also among the top in the world here."
Drones are new and even newer to the police.
There are no statistics on the use of drones by the Finnish police.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There's an awful lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be nice to have visitors to see the Finnish police drone operations.
We are asked for training.
Getting even more common
Himberg points out that finding someone who has disappeared in Finnish winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As mentioned above, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the drone in just a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg said there are plans to train more of them.
Drones are already widely used in police work, and their use will become more and more common in the future.
That’s what I’d like to say, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for the missing, Himberg said, police can use drones in areas such as accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence-gathering.
For example, you need to check a certain area a little further away, where you may be afraid of violence.
The drone can then be used for advance reconnaissance.
Karelian Rugby takes first place
Karjalan Rugby celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
Joensuuns were still midway through the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found the plot in the second period and porched the southern visitors 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-division championship meant an historic rise to Division 1 for Karelian Rugby.
In the past, the club has also played in the first division, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-sarja and the division 1.
The club will be looking to take on the franchise, but it knows quite a bit of work for next winter.
The current roster of just under twenty players needs to be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so fundraising has to be in line with that as well.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal drafted super-promising Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer draft.
The striker joined Montreal's training strength in the late summer and has presented strong touches in September practice games.
Kotkaniemi managed to score a goal in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big developments since arriving at rookie camp.
The NHL regular season begins on Thursday night.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk about leadership this week in Finland.
In an interview with HS, Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nokia, explained his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but there has been talk in previous Nokia reports of executives being unable to act as a team; of fear and of not speaking up, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's up-stage risk-taking ability and agility disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum, a giant business event, was also held in Helsinki, drawing the cream of Finnish business to the Messukeskus.
In addition to lead star Barack Obama, 12 stars from the business world took the stage.
Talk about good management was enough.
According to Gary Hamel, a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a retail chain known for its wide organic range, said the manager needed to know how to communicate to all staff the company's purpose.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a book about introverts, said that the most successful leaders are proven to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
At the beginning of the company, the leader must be able to tell the story on which the company’s future is based.
A company that has grown to maturity needs a leader who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum had 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders - listening to these lessons.
They were in danger of information overload.
It takes a lot to be a good leader.
That's why management so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in a friendly manner.
But they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easily judged by an outsider.
Sara Chafak has arrived on the red carpet from Los Angeles, spending most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the pageant final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also featured a lace train.
A bit of poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there,” Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for a test shoot.
Among other things, he has done advertising shoots.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting and similar to that in Finland.
However, she believes that work must be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for the model’s work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors wins €30,000 live art prize in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth 30,000 euros on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors’ art is vital to her immediate environment.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have lacked in the past, the panel described as the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo searched in major operation: 'We can't tell you where'
Extensive searches by Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Öresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlland were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were searching for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car was found.
We cannot yet say where the car was found," Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police briefing tells the Evening News.
Storm said the black Volvo being searched has no direct connection to the threat, according to police.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Ekstra Bladet, from Denmark, said of the police briefing Saturday.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent on the conduct of the operation.
He did not want to say under what criminal title the matter is being investigated.
But Skov told me it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police would not say whether they have already been taken into custody.
The newspaper said restrictions on ferry services have been lifted.
Police in Copenhagen also followed the developments on their Twitter account.
The STT reports that the police say that the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people are voting on the issue in a contentious election
Macedonia, in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the Republic of North Macedonia would be named.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's bid to join NATO and the EU.
Greece says the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name, but inquires whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by approving the deal.
Voting began sluggishly, at least at a school in the center of the capital, Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, expressed hope that the agreement would be supported.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It marks a shift, especially for young people, he said.
Since independence in 1991, Macedonia has been officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has been campaigning for the deal to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting whether the turnout will exceed the required 50 per cent.
The referendum is not binding, but a yes vote would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of parliament is needed for a constitutional amendment.
The Greek parliament also still has to approve the deal.
Polls close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
Handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out by Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper late on Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, on the outskirts of Stuttgart.
The main match of the night was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title fight.
The chance may open up for whoever wins it to fight in tougher positions than those seen on Saturday, of considerable financial importance.
Helenius tied the fight in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper out with his hard left-handed strike.
Teper could no longer get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent early in the third round, when the German's nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight back in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed the injury and withdrew from the game.
It then emerged that the German had scorched twice in a doping test.
Helenius has played 28 games in his professional career and suffered two defeats.
Teper, who went into the fight as the clear favorite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton on team order to win - difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title was again nearing confirmation, with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton winning the Russian GP to extend his World Championship points lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started the race from pole position, took second place.
Bottas, who took his career-opening win at Sochi last year, held the top spot near the halfway point of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel took third, with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started from the last row, was fifth.
The two men assaulted a man in Joensuu, Finland, and were caught a block away.
Two men assaulted a 31-year-old Juuka man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 after 6 p.m. on Saturday.
Police said the men also seized the victim's phone, among other things.
Police reached the suspects, a hay-watered 35-year-old man, and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, about a block away, shortly after the incident.
They were taken into custody on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim suffered bruising injuries that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of electric car company Tesla, is stepping down as chairman of the company's board.
Musk has agreed with U.S. officials.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets alleging he secured funding to pull Tesla off the stock market.
The U.S. Securities Commission has charged Musk with securities fraud.
Musk will continue to serve as Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a €20m fine if the deal between authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada Fights Against Time to Reach Accord on Nafta With U.S.
Time threatens to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline of Sunday, and negotiators for the two countries have been talking closely through the weekend.
Canada's top negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech to the U.N. General Assembly so she could focus fully on trade talks.
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to put the deal in place before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won Mexico's presidential election, takes office on Dec.
Trump has said Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously briefed Congress that there are plans to sign the treaty at the end of November - whether Canada is on board or not.
Given these timeframes, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada would need to be ready on Sunday to give the US Congress enough time to assess it.
A neighbour thought the candles were warping a fire in Kaakkur - fire crews were alerted to the scene
Candles burned in a high-rise apartment in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm overnight Sunday.
About a dozen emergency services units were called to the scene for a possible apartment fire.
At the scene, it became clear that candles burned in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the house opposite, which was why the emergency services had been notified.
There was no fire at the target.
Police arrest 11 people after Honka-HJK fight - brawling at field and metro station
Eleven people were taken into custody by the police on Saturday after a Honka-HJK match in Espoo, Länsi-Uusimaa Police Department Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and disorder.
Those caught were released after the situation calmed down, Värtinen said.
The arrest was earlier reported by the Evening News.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed to the pitch from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to shoving and fistfights between supporters of the teams.
Among other things, the situation needed to be ended by mounted police officers.
In addition to the field, brawling took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the apprehensions also took place.
I was not there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the brawling on the field.
According to Värtinen, no crimes have been reported as a result of the events.
Tablestone hustled to his butterfly SE time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Työkivi have advanced to the finals on the final day of the World Cup swimming competition in the Netherlands.
The race will take place in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS’s Table Stone beat his Finnish record in the 50 m butterfly, where he was second in the preliminary heats with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Stone swam a distance in Helsinki with an SE time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24th in butterfly swimming at 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the 50m breaststroke heats in 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the first two rounds of the two 100 metres mixed heats, Laukkanen was 15th at 2:14.25.
Students act out a rare delicacy: ancient tragedy - reductive Oresteia affects its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on Finnish stages.
The National Theatre, for example, last saw an ancient tragedy, the Philoctetes of Sophocles, in 1988.
Now Theatre Academy brought the only complete trilogy of plays, Aeschylus Oresteia, on a tour starting at the National Theatre.
In the Lavat avoin! projects, which started in 2015, Theatre Academy acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the blood feud of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law creditably in an hour to twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choral parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuren fine suomeksio (2003).
Dramatic lights and a display revealing the pages of the theatre space emphasize a simplified and bright stage thinking.
At its center is the dynamic between performers who alternately break away from the choir, playing the title roles, and the choir.
The show uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and his spoils, Kassandra, are also shown on the stage, contrary to what was customary in the ancient tradition of performance.
Of course, the show does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created in front of the viewer, who is constantly aware of his ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of students performing as a tight-knit group, indeed as one organism.
Especially in the choral sections, the actors who bend supplely to very expressive, sculptural group formations get their rights bare, only adorned by a white curtain, on the stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer makes its first hydrogen truck
The novelty is starting to show in Europe, especially thanks to a cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
Under a partnership agreement announced at the IAA commercial vehicle show in Hanover, Hyundai will supply a batch of 1,000 cars for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
With the launch of the fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai will continue on the path set by Nexo and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this first-of-its-kind project, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the evolution of the fueling network," Hyundai Motor vice president In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the deal.
Fistfuls whizzed by several times in Kajaani
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men inside and outside a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani in the early hours of Saturday.
The man first punched one man inside the restaurant, causing him to be removed from the scene.
Outside, he shoved another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man in the situation, the abuser still punched him as well.
Police took the abuser into custody.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another officer in the leg.
The man also threatened police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The matter is being investigated as three counts of assault as well as violently resisting a public official.
There was also another assault in Kajaani in the middle of the morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Kajaani man in his mid-20s punched the victim.
A short time later, he was knocked to the ground by another man and the man who punched him earlier was still kicking the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers further away from the victim and police were called.
But the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask anyone who witnessed the incident to contact the Kajaani police by telephone on 0295 416 520 or by email at tutkimus.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Longtime radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle’s long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He passed away from terminal liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yeah, we're good.
The doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to the tabloid a month ago.
The safety of the store's aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When you’re surprised by a story, it’s usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Finnish Service Industries Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious will be brought to the attention of the police and many real violence situations will not be reported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to record their near-misses on the basis of the Occupational Safety and Health Act but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
The problem with violence is that it does not always cause physical injury.
Nevertheless, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a violent situation and a threatening violence situation is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threats has to count as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even if the actual act doesn't happen.
Some neighborhoods are troubled.
The store has acquired security guards.
As store opening hours were released, there was quite a bit of chatter in the media about its impact on the safety of sellers.
"At the time, quite a few employers arranged guard services for at least night-time hours as well as to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have now had an effective effect, but this is producing a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained well under control due to security, the impression was created that security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a crime for the plaintiff, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But under the same subparagraph of the law, enacted in 2011, a minor assault becomes subject to prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time the store's aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court would put a few abusers in jail, and the sentence from there on the hard end of the punishment scale, then habits would tidy up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open almost night and day must ensure the safety of the store’s employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signs off on miss before live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is married then"
The crowning of Missi will not be shown on TV this year in the traditional way, but the broadcast will be shown by the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the trio of presenters briefed the invited guests and media representatives on the progress of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a resounding round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this male presenter of ours, Sohlberg enthused as his colleague cheered the crowd.
The pageant is followed by many of the Miss Finland events of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in the direction of one or the other.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg lobbed a look at the Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg was to refer to the just-divorced Siepp with his throw, who laughed off the comment even though he looked confused at first.
He spoke about his resignation for the first time in a weekend newspaper.
Missikaunotar said that she does not want to explain the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, as it is a matter between her and Roope Salminen.
She said she's in no rush for a new relationship, but plans to focus on herself.
I focus on my own things and, especially, I start living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status came up even later, when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The three plotters laughed at the screw-up.
She was married, or was she?
Janni Hussi signed off on the screw-up.
Groundling man tortured his tied-up common-law husband by slashing, burning and feeding him concentrated sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man who lived in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes committed against his common-law spouse.
Among the crime tools were a belt, cable and zip ties.
The court ruled those items lost to the state.
Rankin charged the suspect with aggravated rape.
But that charge was dismissed by the district court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of harm were attributed to Kokkolan.
The offences took place between last March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the last act, the man was taken into custody and remanded in custody a couple of days later.
On Thursday, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its verdict and ordered that the 34-year-old continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated custodial interference and aggravated rape on May 22.
But these charges were dismissed by the court as unsubstantiated.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public account of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been tied up.
The defendant slashed his victim with a knife, smoked cigarettes, fed him concentrated sauce and poured water and coffee over him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the forfeiture of criminal equipment to the state: belt and cable, zip ties, bathrobe belt, knife as well as vestry.
Four witnesses
The district court said the two sides continued to live together between the acts.
It can be seen from the verdict that a lot of the most egregious acts took place at the end of the crime period.
The court heard from four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay compensation to the victim for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary inconvenience totalling EUR 5800.
It is unlikely that he will have that money, as the convict already has old debts in recovery.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The newspaper does not give a name to protect the victim’s privacy.
At the time of writing, the recent District Court judgment is not legally binding.
Europe with four-point lead heading into Ryder Cup settlement
European golf pros solidified their lead Saturday in a traditional hole-playing match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris by a score of 10-6 with twelve doubles matches still to come on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that began Saturday, and the afternoon foursomes drew 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played as a pair during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved anything like this.
On Sunday, the two will seek more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a Ryder Cup, and there are only three Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns violent harassment of supporters at Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
Football betting league team HJK issued a statement on Sunday condemning the disorderly behaviour of their supporters at the FC Honka match in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement added.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters stormed the pitch and some appeared to be seeking to pick a fight with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The orderly could not calm the situation, but police and mounted police were needed.
HJK says in a statement that the team's players and officials are shocked by what has happened.
Post-match events are not in keeping with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly disclaim any activity that compromises the safety of match events," the statement added.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers in identifying threats to safety and eliminating mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stands.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement says.
Filipino inventor flies drone - here's how to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, a hip-hop dancer and something of a Pelle Peloton.
He is now among a growing number around the world vowing to have invented the flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
But Mendiola doesn't believe in mass production of his device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he glided his device over seven metres.
In fact, one of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola was quoted as saying by Britain's Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action starting tomorrow will be visible in children’s day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the bans on overtime and shift changes starting tomorrow will be particularly visible in social and health services and day care for children, estimates JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide-ranging, and they will certainly show up in the way that there are not enough staff on site.
Everyone needs to know how to find their child.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services are provided and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift changes due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibilities that staff have not been hired, but that employees have been put on overtime or changed shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational health and safety, it is quite normal for every employee to take care of regular working hours and to work only them.
JHL opposes the Government’s intention to reduce redundancy protection for small companies.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market director of municipal employers, does not pre-assess the effects of overtime and shift change bans.
But he doesn't think they will be very revolutionary, although services could be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so impossibly vast, with social and health services and the technical sector, it's hard to say.
The impact can vary very much from industry to industry, region to region and employer to employer," Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that there were already experiences last week of similar activities that lasted for three days, such as that of the local nurses’ union Super and the health and social care trade association Tehy.
Their effects were quite limited.
JHL’s ban on overtime and shift changes applies to employees of municipalities, the church, the state and private health and social services, among others.
Family day care providers, for example, are excluded.
At this point, nearly 100,000 JHL members are affected by the industrial action.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The union has also been preparing for other industrial action if preparations for the redundancy bill continue.
The government should now admit that this is where we run to the wall and hard.
Both the union movement and the government need to come to terms with this.
What is special here is that the tough ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - in the performance fitness circles we study the gestures of a stingray and a seahorse
The Great Coral Reef by the collective Other Spaces premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time at Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the public.
This time, however, a more clearly defined presentation will also be constructed, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There's enough fairy-tale magic in theater play for child participants, too.
The child’s perspective has been included already in the preparation phase of the work.
Still, the Great Coral Reef is not a children’s show but a show that adults and children do in concert.
It gives adults information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to throw themselves into exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
In fact, the Great Coral Reef bears some resemblance to a fairytale ballet, fitness circuit and nature-themed information tour, but definitively it tunes in around visits in a different, non-human condition.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the trajectories of corals as well as coral reef-dwelling organisms and fish.
Six different fitness circuits teach, among other things, the gestures of a stingray and a seahorse.
Finally, there will be a performance of less than an hour in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help introduce you to the life of a coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, we are both diving people observing coral reef life and corals being looked at.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
The looks and observations in many directions make the performance dense and teeming with life.
Whether you are a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at a landscape, and another organism or a landscape looking at an organism - and all of these things at the same time.
It does not seem difficult for the children.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sitratori will host a silent demonstration for endangered corals.
Devastations beyond human understanding must not be allowed to harden, though it might be difficult to grasp the significance of one's own exercise of compassion in the face of the prospects of destruction any longer.
In other spaces, you have constructed your work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousnesses, other species and their future generations, whose wonder and play it clears space for.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm happy I didn't have smartphones in my childhood
Children and young people today are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking more and more when they are younger and younger.
As far as I'm concerned, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do too.
I was overwhelmed when my pal told me she'd had to pick up her fifth-grade sister over the weekend from a "boyfriend."
When he came to pick up his intoxicated sister, she told him about her sex experiences from that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is a grown-up thing.
I wish today's kids could have a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of peer pressure from mates.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram wearing makeup and revealing their clothes in their photos.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing pictures.
It’s even harder to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18 and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forest and playing board games.
I'm happy that I didn't have smartphones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and I didn’t have to think about what other people thought of me.
Yle: Officials told the state leadership that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Defence Police and Defence Forces informed the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the Airiston Helmi investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reports.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
Kanerva said the armed forces and protection police visited the defence and foreign affairs committees this week to brief them on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else in this, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle, the seized material has so far not been found to have a connection to national security, but the investigation is only beginning.
There is no way of knowing what can be revealed, one of the interviewees said.
The extensive house-to-house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is simply about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The Evening Telegraph pieced together a story earlier this week reviewing the claims both for and against.
Video: dream goal rescues Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100 per cent Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more contented team for the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away with a 1-0 away win.
That was when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal throughout the Premier League that City were now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived with the same idea in west London.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk, in particular, seemed to be in sole control of his own on-field header.
Chelsea, meanwhile, had a fine League Cup away win at Anfield Road below them on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard came off the bench to settle the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was there from the very early minutes.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small space for a triangle game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
In the end, the Croat saw Hazard surge forward and sent a perfectly weighted through pass to him.
Hazard drifted little to the edge of the penalty area but bombed a perfect left-footed pull into the back corner from there.
Pool brass keeper Alisson was a little slow in his tackling and could only get his fingertips to the ball.
Klopp must have felt the losing position was lightly unfair because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger cleaned up Mo Salah's control from the goal line.
In the second period, Chelsea’s Kepa also got into action.
The Basque keeper was quick to react to Sadio Mané"s pull and pushed the ball from the base of the post for a corner kick.
At the other end, meanwhile, Alisson zeroed in with a throw-in to put Hazard through.
The visitors' best position came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
But the Brass star's bulldozer headed at national team-mate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
Even that could not last any longer in the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing in his old home stadium, and the striker bombed an irresistible pull into the top corner to celebrate.
Liverpool's 100 per cent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it is still top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly in the title race two points behind at the top of the table.
In Clock Shift Debate, Potores Are Deep
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's response was the only one that stuck in my mind: the Nen suffix.
Some people's last name has a nen suffix and some don't.
After all, divisions can arise anywhere, and here was one serving.
Finland has achieved in the EU that the annual clock change is being phased out.
A lot of people agree that clock-shifting twice a year has been a fool’s errand and caused a lot of problems.
In the end, at least in Finland, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest part now is deciding what time to end up with: the current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
People can also express their opinions on the Otakantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Department for Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
The debate is raging on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position on the effect of morning light on people's well-being and those who defend summer time on the effect of evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and, by extension, well-being.
Both positions have solid supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light rhythms a person’s day and gives them freshness.
On the other hand, if you are not particularly affected by waking up in the dark, light increases people’s movement outdoors and gives better opportunities for autumnal yard work, for example.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been counted towards its hour.
I’d rather have both, but we can’t do anything about our location in the northern part of the world.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of the discussion on the subject that one’s own view is promoted and the other’s view is strongly opposed.
You don't really listen to the other side's arguments, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is rather pointless to try to turn the other person’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The topic is very easy to debate, because it doesn’t require a lot of effort and there’s a lot of mutu-feeling to justify it.
Similar issues tend to be debated most sharply and equally fruitlessly anyway.
I’m sorry if the wrong option has been chosen, but I’m sure you’ll be able to adjust.
And it also always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels gloomy.
Josba battled to a narrow away win
Josba's first away game in Divar produced a full three set points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for home with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led by a goal early in the third period, but Josba picked up compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 winning goal.
With both teams trailing, crucial minutes were played in the flat shed.
The most effective in Josba was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second-string was strong anyway, with Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hitting.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second line when he was born.
Josba has six points after three rounds of the series.
Next up will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks’ time.
200th anniversary celebrations at Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of the church will be celebrated tomorrow in a partly sad atmosphere.
The church fire a week ago was a shock.
Even the church of Eno was guarded in the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a day of celebration.
Even though no one would want that, Eno Church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we move on to the Karelian catering table.
Throughout the day, there are many activities inside and out.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of retired parish master Ari Räsänen, who has served for 37 years.
The church's birth anniversary also marks the end of an era.
The already disused parish hall, built in 1982, will keep its doors open today for the last time.
We are now in evasive mode at the former municipal hall, says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has stood still for 200 years.
Elon Musk to Step Down as Head of Tesla Board Speech, Fraud Charges Settled for $40 Million
Electric car maker Tesla and company CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuit with the SEC, the US securities market regulator.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined from the company he founded.
But Musk will be allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will have to step down as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside board chairman.
Musk will also face tougher scrutiny.
Under the deal, Tesla must hire two independent directors and more closely monitor Musk's communications in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," says Steven Peikin, a director at the SEC.
The case began in August, when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding has been secured.
The tweet momentarily boosted Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and that Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it is suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it will demand that Musk be fined and banned from any further leadership of listed companies.
The SEC's subpoena spooked investors, sending Tesla's stock into a sharp decline.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency.
The death toll is believed to be yet to increase as work to determine the damage is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could run into the thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that surged into the town of Palu on Sulawesi island.
A warning was issued for the tsunami immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
Officials say almost all known dead are from Palu, at least for now.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the quake's center, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Calls for help from rubble
The Indonesian military has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged soldiers to continue the rescue effort without exhaustion day and night.
One focus of the rescue effort is a hotel in Palu, where 50 to 60 people are still believed to be trapped in the rubble.
Muhammad Syaugi, chief of the agency leading the rescue effort, said one person was excavated alive at night from the rubble of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which is popular with business travelers.
We also heard people's pleas for help, he told me.
Syaug said heavy clearing equipment would be needed quickly for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find missing loved ones.
Please help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members still missing," one writer pleaded in a Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into hands of troublemakers in UK
Many British politicians faced harassment after their contact details were leaked due to flaws in the app's encryption.
The hackers were able to access the phone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an app used at the party conference of the British Conservative Party, which is in government.
For example, Michael Gove, the environment, nutrition and rural affairs secretary, who is pushing Brexit, and Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, were targeted for harassment.
Several members of the public received harassment calls.
Due to a lack of encryption on the app, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians on the mobile app for the Conservative Party's annual conference.
The public was able to access the profiles using the politician's email address. which was easily accessible online.
Anyone logging into the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to briefly switch Boris Johnson's profile picture to a porn picture and title insulting.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles using their email addresses.
Then the sign-in person can view the profile person’s contact information and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every reporter, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologised for the leak.
He said technical issues have been resolved and the app is now working safely.
Britain's data regulator, the ICO, is backing the data leak.
The app was developed by Australian company Crown Comms.
Labour, in opposition, criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted on security matters.
Every week there is a large crowd of applauding Poles in the audience of The Wall Suomi
Spectacular viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Suomi quiz show.
The Wall, a US format that has spread rapidly around the world, landed as a Finland version for Nelonen last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are being made.
In the Polish studio, the filming possibilities were exceptional, as the format's large 12-meter-high playing wall required space from the space.
During the kick-off period, a studio audience for the programme, which was billed as Polish, was raised on social media.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, head of domestic programmes at Nelonen, explains this to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience includes the players’ loved ones, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland and just Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international clappers in the Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to the filming of different programmes, Sormunen explains.
He reminds us that watching the game itself is not that difficult to understand, even if you don't understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to distinguish.
But for foreign-language speakers, there are interpreters present in the studio to handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously for the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on," says Sormunen.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhoff was dealt with the other day in a domestic production.
David Hasselhoff took part in the filming of Talent Finland in Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly getting simultaneous interpretations in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish during the photo shoot,” says Sormunen.
Typhoon that battered southern Japan advances toward main islands - officials warn of landslides and flooding
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but officials say major injuries have been avoided and there are no reports of casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
NHK public broadcaster says people have been evacuated to shelters, and power has been cut to more than 300,000 households.
More than 1,000 flights have been canceled, and bullet trains are at a standstill in some places because of the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly in the storm's path, but high winds and rain are also expected.
Train services have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
Weather scientists say Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky is still darkening
It's been a bad start to the season for aces.
The skies were already darkened to almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on home soil to Vaasan Sport on Saturday.
The Finns now have five consecutive defeats, with a total of two points from six rounds.
None of the Aces' defenders or players from the lower two chains have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
The crowd was already running out of room when the game was almost half over.
We've only just played six games and of course there's no reason to give up on this.
We have to worry because we played very poorly.
Especially the performance in the second period was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2 for Ässi, said.
Sport, of course, was winning.
The team had a game under from Friday, so you would have thought that would show in the making.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to take advantage of it.
Bread Day visitor numbers continue to rise
Mother Pirkko Hyvärinen of Bread Day marvels at the crowds in the grand hall.
Somehow I thought that there might not be so many people this year, Hyvärinen thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Cross Championships were held simultaneously with the Bread Day, so perhaps the expectation would be that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, this was not the case; the corridors were already heavily blocked before 10 a.m., the sellers reported that the products had run out, nearly 500 servings of news porridge were sold more than before, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had increased.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon were particularly busy for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of times.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Every year, the sellers also turn to Liperi from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 presenters, sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products, had arrived at the breadmaker.
Mother of the day PIRkko Hyvärinen admired the crowd from the hall’s stand.
The day of bread was initially blessed with a harvest.
In the children's category, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different shapes of bread arrived for the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the marttas’ pie workshop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere and read the book without tiring the eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
Here are three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting increases with the number of years behind.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many face as they age, as their visual acuity decreases and more people suffer from glare.
As parents grow older, so does the need for light.
A 60-year-old needs light three times more than a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is advisable to invest in the healing effects and properties of the light for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light but no glare, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
A beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment has a choice.
There is an unassuming Japanese style combining Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colours, has also boomed.
Authenticity is the same as the rest of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express your personality
On the other hand, there is now more investment in the home than before, and interior design has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customised, even bold light fixture for your own home that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious," Jokiniemi says.
You don't necessarily get the latest trend lamp for your home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for for many years.
Certain timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics stand their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian striker after three games
KooKoon and forward Brendan O'Donnell part ways.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games in orange black with no power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract that included a trial period that runs until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL with Kunlund Red Star and in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There is no word yet on O'Donnell's new club.
Gamer wants to set an example in recycling - goods go out in the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
Pelimies, a specialty retailer of games, now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of customers of the brick-and-mortar store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packed in packages from importers, for example.
All packages coming to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a condition where it can be used,” says Ville Puurula from Oulun Pelimies.
As a general rule, the company uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
You avoid bubble plastic as far as possible.
In the near future, we are planning to move to recycled materials in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause any extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies, because in addition to new products, the store’s central product range includes used games and equipment.
Every fashion conscious's purchase: One and the same shirt works for every outfit
Classic clothing works from season to season in attire.
With their versatility, they create a good foundation for gardenob, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics even at low cost.
In autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
A black knit made of natural material with turtlenecks cannot be a mistake.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, a tulle skirt and jeans, and you can create both a low-key outfit and a flashy style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both the youthfully modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
Here's how to create a style.
The fall trend look comes from gold brown and wide-leg corduroy trousers, a black polo sweater and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo knit, along with the other classics, the blue-green Scots plaid skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Bring an edge to the black turtleneck by combining it with casually trendy clothing items: denim skirts, high boots and chunky tights.
Youthful and stylish!
Sabotage by Russian intelligence agencies has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRGs specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet security service KGB in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says archivist Vasili Mitrohin (1922- 2004), who defected to the West.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline links.
In Germany, the KGB provided DRGs with Bundeswehr, railway, gamekeepers and road workers with uniforms and accessories for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine and cordoned off Crimea from its motherland.
Cold War-era agents stashed kits containing mines, explosives, detonators and communications equipment for sabotage teams off-road.
As recently as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, with a trap mine target exploding when authorities sprayed it with water cannon.
Police reach four drink-drivers in province at night
Police caught four drunk drivers in different parts of North Karelia between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
At 4:30 a.m., he was driving with two passengers on board.
On the Kuorevaarantie road in Polvijärvi, a car swerved into a ditch at 4 a.m., and a 19-year-old local man in a car alone blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him at the exit.
A 20-year-old out-of-town man driving a passenger car in the centre of Outokumpu blew 1.33 per mille on a breathalyser.
The police suspect the male drivers in question of aggravated drunk driving and the Polvijärvi driver of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning, at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van blew 0.52 per mille.
He is suspected of driving under the influence.
Police are appealing for reports of a stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was captured on CCTV.
Dressed in dark trousers and a brown or beige jacket, the dark-haired suspects left immediately after the stabbing in a dark station wagon in the direction of Ratapihankatu bus station.
One suspect exited on a bicycle in the direction of Humalistonkatu city centre.
Pedestrian dies after being hit by bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after being struck by a bus.

Police are investigating the events leading up to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, sports director at HPK in Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (centre) has been important for the team in terms of starts, under-strength play and the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in terms of starts, under-strength play and the defensive role of field four.
Even though there is still room for improvement, it is good for a young team to hold on to such an experienced player,” says Mika Toivola, Head of Sports at HPK.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska increases when playing ice hockey’s League solution games.
A centre-back from Pietarsaari, Riska has previously played league hockey in JYP, Lukko and Sport.
In contrast, winger Oskari Lehtinen was out of contract after a trial period.
True story today on TV: Climber was left to die twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie was based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 film tells the story of a struggle for survival that has been dealt with extensively.
There have been films - and documentaries - about the tragedy before.
There are real events going on in this case as well.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life may have been saved by eye surgery carried out before he left for Nepal.
As a result of that and the atmospheric pressure, he lost his vision, which is why the conquest of the peak had to be skipped.
Rob Hall moved on and never came back.
But Weathers's struggle with life and death had only just begun.
As the storm came up, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When they came looking for him, he was found in such poor condition that survival was not believed.
Weathers was left for dead.
Miraculously, however, he got back on his feet and found the others.
Weathers, who was badly cold, was still thought to be dying and once again was left to his own devices.
What is clear is that, contrary to expectations of a different kind, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility enough to give him help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is portrayed by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Celebrating the 200th anniversary of Eno Church today
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and to celebrate the anniversary, a celebration for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The party started at Eno Church Hill at 10 a.m. with a family Mass, after which there have been offerings from a Karelian banqueting table at Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people attended the family fair.
The pastor of the church, Armi Rautavuori, was delighted that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and will give strength to the work,” Rautavuori (pictured) says.
The fire in the church has touched many and was not ignored at the bicentenary celebration of Eno’s parish.
Eno Church is now an elder of Joensuu Evangelical Lutheran parishes after the Kiihtelysvaara church was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotional was held in Kiihtelysvaara to silence and remember the church that was destroyed in the fire.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed his might in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type fall storm rolled from the southwest into Greece on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Agency has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
Images from the area show heavy flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows a river suddenly appearing between houses in the town of Kiato in the Corinthian region instead of the street due to flooding.
Another video shows the car being carried away by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, high winds caused strong seas.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens is instructing people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The embassy is urging that weather reports and local authority guidance be followed.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even a risk of flooding.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medicans occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left a trail of flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing northward and toward Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been caused by refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
For the thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps, access to decent shelter is limited.
Areas around Athens that were devastated by wildfires in the summer also remain under the storm.
A medic also went on the rampage in Greece last November.
We must not go to the sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently holidaying on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking you should be careful not to have branches or other bulk flying on top in a storm.
The guides have distributed such instructions to more than 3,500 Finns vacationing in Greece through Aurinkomatkat during the weekend.
The instructions will be needed as even the terrible storm Zorbas has been predicted to batter the Greek islands this weekend.
In the vicinity of the island of Crete, for example, wind speeds can reach gusts of up to 45 metres per second.
Heavy rains add to the wretchedness of the weather.
Anyone who has travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland and provided their phone number has been warned of high winds by text message, according to tour operators.
Still the sun and warmth in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert in solar travel communications, by early evening on Saturday, the worst has been avoided in the resorts.
For example, flights have landed and boarded according to a normal schedule.
Of course, we monitor the situation all the time.
Safety comes first.
Tui's media officer Antonia Schroderus says their flights have also been running on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least Crete was still calm, he said in the early evening on Saturday.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of more than 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon in Rhodes the sun was shining and the temperature reached 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Aurinkomatkat.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next nuisance in Turkey, albeit with a slight relaxation.
In case of this, we have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and checked, for example, the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya on Tui," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss have completely identical evening gowns in the pageant final - here's how they reacted to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening gown.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals, who found me a great dress for this evening, Hussi smiles.
The very same silver evening gown had also been chosen by presenter Shirly Garvinen.
The two also noticed similar outfits themselves and took a laugh at the situation.
Garfield told the Evening News that he had been busy preparing, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi will be the backstage and red carpet host in the pageant finals, and he will chat to the arriving front-row stars.
Huss has recently moved to Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday
For now, I'm going to stay there, we'll see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi reflected.
Before moving, Hussi was vacationing alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was just staying in a hotel for a week and not going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Garfield's behaviour on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnering the curious stares of pensioners
Shirly Karvinen, the presenter and the 2016 Miss Finland finalist, said that she had had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Finland photo shoots.
There has been so much hurry that Karvinen arrived directly from a Finnair flight.
I did my makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
A change of clothes at home, Garfield laughs.
Garfield says she pulled out her makeup amid the retirees.
Indeed, his preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least to others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Garfield says he enjoyed his stint as host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience as having been halting so far, too.
Garfield said he went to check out the singles on the show Friday.
It's really brutal in some ways.
They are the genuine feelings of people, Garfield describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I put on over-the-knee boots?
Three perfect example outfits
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in attire like an outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes more modern specimens can be included.
The over-the-knee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter seasons a few years ago have gone nowhere.
As its name suggests, the boots over the knee repeat in style from year to year and season to season.
Impressive boots divide the opinions of wearers, but a bold design is worth trying, well - boldly.
Over-the-knee boots are actually suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's denim, lace, tulle or tights, the simple leather or faux leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look great in party looks as well as everyday outfits.
Black over-the-knee boots are perfect for even the most delicate outfits.
They appropriately balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plaited skirt and a cuddly, plush knit.
A fresh but autumnally stylish everyday outfit for romantic tastes.
The strong and slightly retro ensemble comes from a long copper brown velvet dress, over-the-knee boots, spectacular earrings and a rivet little bag.
While there's a certain sophistication to the over-the-knee boots, they're also perfect for casual everyday wear along with a T-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring traffic will be started in the area with a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot robot vehicle traffic throughout the year and test the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars fare on today's street grid.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real-world environment, says Traffic Management Manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, self-driving cars will travel fully automatically among other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the co-passenger.
All the time, vehicles sense their surroundings with several sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the obstacle detected is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
Robot cars will run three days a week throughout the autumn: Tuesdays from 1pm to 3.30pm, Wednesdays from 10am to 3pm and Thursdays from 10am to 3pm.
Robot trucks stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robotic vehicle stops can be identified by stop markings.
The most safe way to get aboard is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
Mokoma bassist fell off stage mid-show and was injured
The Mokoma band announces on their Facebook page a surprising situation at the Pakkahuone gig in Tampere.
Mokoma’s gig at Pakkahuone in Tampere took a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell from the stage during the performance.
The situation occurred as the band was pulling the last song of the night.
Spidey's wrist was broken.
The band will announce this on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu stumbled off the stage at Pakkahuone last night and broke his wrist.
Let's wish a speedy recovery to our metal bro!
The rest of the tour's shows will be handled by alternate occupation, the website reads.
Fans of Mokoma are anxiously responding to a photo update showing bassist Santtu lying cast in hand on a bed.
This news has been waiting for me, I was worried about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones heal thankfully over time.
Cheers and a quick recovery to Santu and a good follow-up tour for the rest of the band plus the fill-in!
And thanks for last night, it was a great gig, but promise to leave out such a strong drama from the end of the gigs in the future? writes one fan.
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savonia
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Wildlife Agency in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's wilderness liaison officers said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and license of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, permits for the possession of hunting weapons were checked, as well as the permitted cartridge quantities for self-loading guns used in chicken foraging.
Police said 112 hunters were checked during the surveillance, and only one hunter who lacked a required hunting permit was encountered during the surveillance.
The hunter was fined 12 days for the unauthorized catch.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown away by police, and two of them are suspected of drunken driving.
In addition, patrols dealt with five traffic violations in the fines procedure, police times.
In summary, hunters comply very well with the license to hunt.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter noted that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in the autumn together with other surveillance authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects particularly vulnerable people to run.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly needy position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected in the group of those coming to Finland than are in the quota, because in practice some people do not arrive for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior, will also be on the trip.
Quota increase talked about
Finland has been accepting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since emerged in the government to raise it.
The Coalition has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has most recently fallen foul of the Blues' resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen’s visit will be the first by the Minister of the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Ministers of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (Kok.) were able to move to their new positions before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives a subsidy of EUR 10,000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's get out of here - you don't know if you're going to cry or laugh anymore
On Saturday, he announced a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals as farm animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities that are not specifically permitted by government decrees.
In principle, therefore, everything is prohibited except the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up becoming law, it will mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety of society or good manners.
In principle, a ban on all activities that are not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now being enacted.
The change means that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until a law or decree approving it has been issued.
In general, the government’s response to the law has been weak.
If we start on the path that basically everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act will require an update.
But a legal project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder whether it will accept this sort of 'nothing is permitted in law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legal project.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of autumn
This autumn's trendwear comes in snake print.
It looks particularly good on the skirts.
Combine a snake-trimmed skirt with a pair of more understated tops, such as a polo or plain T-shirt, to keep the ensemble stylish.
This autumn you can see plenty of silk and especially the silk skirt is one of the trendiest pieces of clothing of the season.
Combine a gorgeous silk skirt with a finely feminine top or casually knit as a pair.
You can toy with a silk skirt more daringly and throw on a pair of sneakers or autumn trend shoes cowboy boots, for example.
No matter if it's grey, brown or multi-hued, all plaid-patterned skirts are now part of every woman's must-have fallwear.
Boldly combine different colours and play with the plaid pattern with different textures.
For example, the combination of grid pattern and ball pattern is beautiful.
The asymmetrical hemlines are a breeze from summer lightness that you can take with you into autumn.
At the same time, the asymmetric hem is feminine and playful, perfect for both everyday and festive occasions.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks sweetly in Jere's arms
In the Karalahti family photo, sweet three-month-old baby Alexia takes centre stage.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day care centre established in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, were added to the family at the beginning of July.
The couple's firstborn son, Jax, turned 2 in May, while little Alexia is just a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, with the entire Karalahti family.
Nanna posted a picture on Instagram of the mood in Spain, with the entire Karalahti family posing.
Children Jax and Alexia are in their parents' arms.
The attention is paid to the sweetly sulky baby Alexia, resting in dad Jere's arms.
Grateful for this.
Thankful for goodness, forgiveness, people’s generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti alongside her family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and ex-hockey player Jere Karalahti, who came out of the Fitness Diaries programme, recently went into the daycare business and opened an Aito daycare centre in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahti, the company also includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for education.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the director of the day care centre.
Calls in Turkey to charge mobile phones in case of storm
Storm Zorba, which blew through Greece on Saturday, is expected to move into Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the country's west coast of the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reportedly moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
In the early evening on Saturday, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access is working so people can get up-to-date status updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to gust between 28 and 33 meters per second.
Red weather warning issued in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the southern Greek regions of Attica, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were urged to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago when I got in touch, there was a strong wind and it was raining.
People were quite calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from the travel agency Tui told STT on Saturday.
Waverly described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Foreign Ministry had also received no messages about Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, ships were not operating Saturday, the local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agents told STT.
The Finnish embassy in Athens said temporary disruptions to air and ship traffic were expected.
Finnair said on Saturday that the weather situation was being actively monitored.
Kimi Raikkonen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen admitted that his biggest rival Mercedes was too much for the Russian GP.
But there is no reason to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver reckons.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a huge issue.
Our car was the best in the time trial all weekend so far, but they were just too fast," said Raikkonen, who was fourth and with team-mate Sebastian Vettel clearly out of the Mercedes pace.
Ferrari had a tough time at the last race in Singapore.
He was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes car.
They seem to be going faster than us - simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably be going at the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always guesswork, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
The time trial saw a rare treat for Raikkonen's future stable Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Raikkonen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, with Marcus Ericsson also reaching the final time trial session.
For the Swedish driver, the 10th starting position is the best in more than three years.
And while no fewer than five drivers failed to drive at all in the second driving session, the outcome was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Raikkonen in the future?
Yes, if you compare to where they were early in the season, then the step forward has been a big one.
It's going to be a different story next year, so we'll see, we'll see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was the more proactive side in the ring, but he couldn't get some decent hits across.
Helenius, who is much more extended, controlled the match with his hard sets, which found their way there well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical shape than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round, when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The hit was so bad that the old man in front of the home crowd didn’t even try to get up from the mat.
Once the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the crowd and his opponent.
For a moment, he changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a huge win for Helenius’ career.
There might even be a chance to go to a World Cup match, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
Defeat, by contrast, might have ended an entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
You don’t get any younger in this, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
Death toll from Indonesia disaster could multiply
The Guardian reports that the country's vice president is urging a clear rise in the casualty rate.
Jusuf Kalla, the country's vice president, said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are searching for those trapped as well as the dead in the worst-hit areas of Sulawesi island: the port city of Palu as well as its neighbouring Donggala municipality.
So far all the victims are from Palu, there is still no clarity on the situation in Donggala.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the downtrodden buildings that rescuers have been unable to get out.
A hotel in Palu called Roa Roa, for example, has caved in.
Rescuers say they have heard screams from people trapped in the rubble, but a lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the military to carry out rescue and clearance work.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as power and telecommunications are down in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also depleting.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a roar of laughter
A new Miss Finland is currently being chosen at Billnäs Ironworks.
In a round of interviews, each of the pageant finalists was asked a question.
The finalists drew a question from a glass bowl onstage.
In particular, the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, elicited sweet but good-natured laughs from the audience.
The question posed to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the pageant finalist has read.
He thought about his answer well before he hesitated.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is...," Anttikoski said, thinking.
A pause for thought caused laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I've read is...
I read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is economics by someone," Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud ovation from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier in the pageant, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principles.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year’s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will step down.
Sike's apple-pear cake takes its tongue out
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples of your own making, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think quite a few are already growing it too.
This cake can only be made with apples if you don't want to buy the pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake is also served with a pear.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed codas.
Slice.
Melt the butter in a saucepan.
Whisk the eggs and sugar into a foam and then add the cornflour and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the cornstarch, or maizena, and baking powder and add those to the batter, too.
Add the almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line a breadcrumb with baking paper, scatter 2 tablespoons sugar on the bottom of the casserole and spread the pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the dough over the pear slices and the apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is a beautiful brown.
Leave to cool in a casserole dish, then overturn on a serving platter.
Cut the cake until cooled.
The cake is fragile in texture and crumbles easily because the dough has almond and corn flour free of gluten.
Ruka to host international crime fiction event in January
An international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime fiction will be held in Ruka, Kuusamo, in January for the first time.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related programme numbers as well as jazz music.
The festival’s literary guests include Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish detective fiction, and Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, the Swedish duo behind the pen name Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers will be represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a setting for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have identified two distinct types of “coolness”: a generally attractive coolness and a somewhat opposite dissident coolness.
Charmingly cool people, according to the researchers' description, had many traits considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, amicable and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebelliousness and edge.
They craved experiences and paid little heed to the assessments of outsiders.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of tough guy is not cool in the long run: high status in your teens doesn't necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partied, sought out good-looking people and sought the favor of others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once more inconspicuous peers.
High-status communications such as ski vans, designer bags or watches don't make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the vast majority of people were more prepared to make friends with those wearing a plain supermarket shirt than a branded one - despite the fact that most chose to wear a branded shirt when getting acquainted.
If you're in the holiday islands of Greece, look out!
It's about to be hit by a hurricane - weather warning screams red
Over the weekend, southern Greece could see as much rain as Finland has on average over the past six months.
Storm Zorbas hits Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on the weather service's Foreca blog.
It said the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
In comparison, storm Kuisma, which battered Finland early this week, blew at its hardest at a rate of just over 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
This weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water could reach southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm earlier this week has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize the Love Island -Anku?
Appears in baffling YouTube videos
Not many people know that in the Love Island Finland series, beauty Anku, drooled over by several men, also appears as a craft aunt in strange Youtube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to make an octopus from an old roll of paper towels.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can craft a hedgehog out of tights and grow the right spikes.
Now let’s make the Easter grass grow, but let’s do it in a somewhat surprising way,” Anku hints and shows off the sawdust, tights and raisin seeds that he makes into a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku's YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more dozens of minutes after his pole-sitter at the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
A fine lap left behind Mercedes' number one Lewis Hamilton and was certainly important mentally for the Finnish rider who has drawn criticism this season as well.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the settlement round.
I feel good, still shaking a little bit, Bottas found out.
I've only been on pole once this year, in Austria (in midsummer), so it's been quite a while.
This track has been good to me in the past, and I got some good laps again.
It's not easy to overtake on the Sochi track, so the start plays a particularly big role.
And sure enough, Bottas got to answer a query as to whether he'll be racing for the win tomorrow or whether he's going to be jeezed by Hamilton, who's closing in on the World Championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pole, Bottas balked.
But as a stable, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis's lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference with me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, though, Bottas fleshed out.
Hamilton was genuinely delighted with Bottas's success after the drive, and there was a taste of what Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff saw too.
Lewis had every intention of beating Valtteri, but he failed to make the sevens turn.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff enthused.
To the question of whether the team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive honestly, Wolff replied dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning, see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee wins Finnish Rally Championship
The rally car series ended in a rare way.
Almost never before have the brothers become champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula in the closing rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik the SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen of Kitee secured the best achievement of his career when third place in the closing race sealed him the Finnish championship for the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen and co-driver Ville Mäkelä, who competes in the Honda Civic, started the Turku race with composure because the starting points were clear: placement in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to concede a handicap when some of the extra lights failed on the second special stage.
It was a bit of a mess for the third time.
In a situation like that, you don't want to be hunkered down.
On Saturday, the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was second in the series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on U.S., France, Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria's foreign minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to pull their troops out of Syria.
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and the war against terrorists, he said, is "nearly over."
In his U.N. speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
There is no end to the seven years of war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday in Germany that a meeting with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey was planned for October.
Not quite the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Justice Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, received an extraordinary number of people at the screens.
In the United States, the full-throttle Supreme Court judge nomination drama got at least 20 million people in front of their televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, the California professor who accuses him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their stories.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were watched by a total of 20.4 million viewers on the six main networks, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
They were joined online by several million more following the consultation.
NBC reported that the live stream was watched by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it set its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast starts.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million when you include those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made it to 8.0 million starts.
Digital startups are the channels' own, with TV viewership figures from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen releases final readings on Monday, but they are dizzying in any case.
Few reach 20 million
Over 20 million viewers in the U.S. usually only attend sports matches, the big Oscars and Grammys, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
To be sure, the most-watched program in the U.S., the American Football League's NFL Finals game at the Super Bowl, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl drew about 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, Trump’s first address to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people, according to Nielsen.
Top priority
The Supreme Court nomination is extremely important in the United States, as the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans succeeded in preventing then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second seat opened when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was the so-called balancer on several issues whose vote could decide the nine-person court's position.
He was a supporter of abortion rights and sexual minority rights and, for example, ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples were granted the right to marry across the federal government.
Kavanaugh is far more conservative in his positions.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock up the court's conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to receive their information from parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children’s health information on the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's strange.
The situation of the Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying than this: parents were unable to see even the health information or prescriptions of infants.
The situation was temporarily corrected in autumn 2016 for under-10-year-olds.
Since then, there have been promises to fix the practices, but it has taken an amazing amount of time to fix them.
Now a fix is in store - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a roll-through.
After that, with the layman's understanding, it's all about the push of a button: now, when the wire is held, let's open it.
Of course, a child can show their details to their parents - if they have bank credentials or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is chargeable, and the 10-year-old doesn't even get the bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of a fourth grader in a primary school except by asking for it in print.
It's not so much a question of parental rights as children's rights.
It is extremely important for the care of a child that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the teenagers' right to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors may also have family situations in which not all matters can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply meaningful human right.
In U.S., FBI began gutting harassment allegations against Kavanaugh
The FBI is investigating allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
One of the two women appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his student days.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation should not take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation and may not become public.
Man threatened to kill officers at police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to bunt even in the chamber.
Police say they put the man in police custody to "calm down."
The police were threatened by the alleged abuser on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authorities will inform about an incident that began when a 30-year-old man violently challenged a restaurant in the city centre.
The man first assaulted another customer inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him to the ground.
When a third party sought to intervene, the man still punched him as well.
The triple-whammy led to the police being called.
The patrol apprehended the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another officer in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault police officers.
Police say they sent a man to a police prison to "calm down."
The man is a suspect in three counts of assault and violently resisting an official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work on Indonesia's Sulawesi - "Clean water is the most urgent"
The United Nations children's agency UNICEF and other international aid agencies are on standby to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to Finland's UNICEF chief of information Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for more help is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
Along with normal operations, Unicef always has a full emergency response capability, reports Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the rubble, both the survivors and the dead.
In the town of Palu on Sulawesi, rescue efforts are under way, but in the Donggala area a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections don't work.
Aid efforts are difficult because roads are also cut off, notes Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - tents, for example - and clean water to begin with.
Clean water is the most urgent in a crisis.
In most cases, people can be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Efforts will be made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency water will be transported by trucks, for example.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Finding family members and reuniting families is part of UNICEF’s mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP).
In the initial phase, funds previously raised will be used for emergency relief.
UNICEF, among others, has already started fundraising to help victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits as Tesla board chairman - $20m fine for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of space rocket and electric vehicle companies, avoids fraud charges with a deal with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is quitting his role as chairman of electric car company Tesla and agreeing to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of a deal he struck with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By settling, Musk avoids fraud charges.
Musk was threatened with securities fraud by the US Securities Commission (SEC) over tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing to pull electric car company Tesla off the stock market, which prompted a rapid rise in the company's stock price.
Under the deal, Musk will not be allowed to serve as chairman of Tesla's board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and include two "independent directors" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal fine of $20 million, the Tesla company will also have to pay $20 million in similar fines to the financial regulator.
Tweets misled investors
The SEC said Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured financing to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited liability company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock market at $420 a share.
Tesla's stock price rose more than ten percent in 24 hours after the tweets, but later fell.
The SEC said Musk's claims had no basis in fact.
The watchdog said he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed pulling out of the stock market with the rest of the management team or the company's board.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped 14 percent when the securities regulator, the SEC, announced a fraud indictment.
The news of the deal is expected to reassert the company's course.
The Last Judgment Is Not the Cause
Naturally, the bells in the cathedral do not ring when the hands are not moving.
It's a technical glitch.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The wise men point to 12 o'clock.
The situation is like something out of a mediocre horror movie: still when there would be an exorcism from the church crypt and the organ would be playing on its own.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
A repairman has visited it, but a part has broken down and a new part is expected,” says Eveliina Jamsen, a guardian.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already made by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen reports that the church bells do not ring because of the fault.
