9-year-old boy found dead in Texas
Police have been on a search mission for a nine-year-old boy who ran away in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A report of a boy who had left Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
The police situation centre said the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening News around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine and now we're starting the aftermath.
The boy was found in the area around the home, the father said.
Ronaldo on another frenzy - ripping goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league at the weekend and continued to manufacture in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal king turned, at least for a while, in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone at the top of the all-time goalscorer standings when he fired visitor Shahtar Donetsk into the net for two hits from the penalty spot and one from the situation in the game.
Ronaldo increased his goal tally to 80 while Barcelona's Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has a tally of 77.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A, but started strongly in Group D of the Champions League with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored just over ten minutes before the end by Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of the knee-troubled Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in a major league game this weekend, didn't come on until the final ten minutes.
Manchester's other club United were also hit hard in Holland against PSV Endhoven after suffering a one-two defeat.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's away game lasted only a quarter of an hour.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking sliding tackle hit the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to break a tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium for a dozen minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital for treatment.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno equalized before the break in added time.
PSV's winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
The goal-scoring season in the Champions League began with Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
It was the case of Angel Di Maria of Argentina, who swapped Manchester United's shirt for a PSG tutu.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball into the back corner past Malmo goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made it 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG have been tipped to be among the season's achievers.
That assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the league's minor clubs, is not the best comparison.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional starting club Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic began his career at Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team Moscow's TsSKA lost 0-1 to Wolfsburg in a Group B match in Germany.
Opposition party immediately called for resignation; president gave wrong speech
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had delivered a month ago.
Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, has made the same speech in parliament as he did at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirits.
The main opposition MDC party called on Mugabe to step down because he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the mix-up had occurred solely at Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was previously and now about China's influence on the country's economy.
Germany, Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have called for an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week over the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, which chairs the summits, assessed the request.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said heads of state should discuss cooperation with countries of origin as well as how to more effectively register those coming to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are among the items on the table for interior ministers, according to Merkel.
Teacher admits shooting girlfriend during 911 call
A voice only slightly shivering college teacher Shannon Lamb tells police during a 911 call that he shot his girlfriend and that officers need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that her "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, as well as saying that contact information for the dead woman's next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on the side of the notebook: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take this back I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me," said the letter, which experts say was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online classes at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school's campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, on the doorstep of his study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard gunfire at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide as police surrounded the sound.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive a day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Investigators on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who, however, potentially had problems.
Students said they had been waiting for her classes.
Police in the town where Prentiss died, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote thanking the "awesome people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended each man's classes.
On the other hand, there were some signs of trouble.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and uneasy, "as if something was off."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for medical leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health issue.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring principles meant that while Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career advancement and an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said there was no conflict of any kind between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something on Lamb's mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb fled the campus, police were able to track him down as he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, said Methel Johnson, the Washington County coroner.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, though Johnson said he believes Lamb knew the people who live there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 residents.
Lamb completed his Ph.D. in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer in those days.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said Hairston, now 40, who lives in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In a 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence whatsoever of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverfront brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' former husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends. They now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"She's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
Mr O'Steen said he had not met Lamb but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played some gigs together.
O'Steen said her daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a variety of online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, a shady bar near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of Sept. 5, after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica recital for a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We messed around and threw slurs at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Schmidt, the dead teacher, ran a seminary program for first-year students and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married with three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas, as well as being the president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candlelight devotion was held on the Delta State campus in Cleveland with about 900 people attending, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
The story has been corrected to say that officers now say Lamb made a 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says current permanent and seasonal employees will be given the option to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, with staff numbers rising from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help man stores and sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a hugely important moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realised that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realised that Princess Diana's seat was next to mine," he said in the trailer for the forthcoming documentary Back in Time.
The film starts and it occurs to me that I'm just a faux yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future that featured interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and director of production Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "To me, it's arguably the finest time-travel movie ever made."
Back in Time will be available on video-on-demand, DVD as well as in some cinemas in October.
U.N. chief says no armed solution to Syria situation
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "will not be solved by armed means," with additional weapons only exacerbating violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The U.N. chief again called on all parties, including the divided U.N. Security Council, to unite and support no one in non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- on the sidelines of General Assembly ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the division of the council, the Syrian people as well as regional powerhouses "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on the five permanent member states to show the kind of solidarity and consensus they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear program when dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to brand him as a wind-up banner.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to gridlock Donald Trump out of the top spot in endorsement polls, it hasn't (yet) been successful.
In 10 of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has been leading by double digits, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's nomination chances.
Of course, the election season is still in its early stages.
Those results don't yet mean Trump is likely to become the Republican nominee.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got behind any states in the nominating process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in a general election.
But outside groups, including Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump's resilience and begun using their funds to bring him down.
The following recent poll results suggest that the real estate king isn't just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity numbers have done an about-face.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University endorsement polls showed that only two Republicans in 10 welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six in 10 Republicans view Donald Trump favorably.
About three in 10 say they have a negative view.
Those numbers hold true in the first primary states, too.
In an endorsement poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if Trump were to become the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump were the nominee.
Only two in 10 said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent "excited" vs. Trump's 40 percent).
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio at just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "disgruntled" or "shocked" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became the nominee.
Trump's fiery temper is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombastic speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters at the national level think the real estate king has the character befitting a president.
According to last week's Quinnipiac poll, in the state of Iowa, which is hosting the first convention, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the character befitting a leader.
But according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think his character isn't suited to serving as president, and nearly six in 10 think his character doesn't belong in the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they take the view that Trump is the real alternative.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four in 10 thought Trump was the most likely choice when asked who was most likely to be nominated for the Republican nomination.
As recently as the end of July, four in 10 supported Jeb Bush.
Disclosure of the data: Republican Party voters have not always had access to the brightest possible crystal ball.
At this time last election season, four in 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Either way, this shows that the majority of Republican voters think the Trump campaign is credible.
Even if Republicans line up to endorse another candidate, Trump would still win nearly every one.
Some commentators have pointed out that the splintered field likely has contributed to Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support is split among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost every other Republican candidate, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19 and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie each by 33 points.
He's tied for the lead with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat Trump?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a big 18 points.
A majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that just over half of pro-Trump voters have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that they will never change their mind.
Forty-six percent said they could potentially switch candidates.
Either way, Trump's biggest rival right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to side with Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign launch speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some worry that Trump's largess will drive Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six in 10 Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a person outside of politics than one with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll from Iowa two weeks ago showed that three in four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "disgruntled" and 21 percent are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance on Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, will face David Cameron for the first time at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn rises to ask the first of his six questions shortly after midday, and is likely to be watched closely by both the media and Labour MPs for his performance.
Corbyn has called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly show.
He has also said he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow cabinet and addressed the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem at Tuesday's commemoration service for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain air war has drawn criticism from Conservative MPs and featured in a number of front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he "stood respectfully silent" and that he recognises "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the Great British Air War."
Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, stated to BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite his belief that the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences on economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences over the party's position in the European Union as well as the government's aid cap have also "piled up" within the Labour Party since Mr Corbyn was appointed.
Speaking at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions, Mr Corbyn said Labour would bring forward an amendment that would remove the entire cap.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow government work and pensions secretary, stated that the party was "quite clear" that they were merely opposing the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,0000.
Mr Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the past decade, when he has been leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to policy and now reports that he has "crowdsourced" ideas into questions for the prime minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, the MP for the Islington North area, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational and that he intends to refrain from both witty diction and barbs, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality as well as the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow cabinet economic secretary, deputises for him during Question Time when Mr Corbyn does not attend - for example, when Mr Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could also sometimes be allowed to speak and has said he approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, about the issue.
When Mr Cameron took over in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theatre often associated with Prime Minister's Question Time, but he was later forced to admit he had failed.
Since they began being televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure of the leader's judgment, his control of the Commons, as well as his standing with other MPs, although critics have criticised the Question Hours for becoming little more than a travesty calling for far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless youth are trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tricky place to be homeless.
But a group of former street kids have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a nonprofit studio where homeless youth are taught how to take photographs of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

Pound set to rise as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the numbers showed a rise in UK pay growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with bidding target SABMiller.
Between May and July UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared with the same time last year.
The pace of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was seen as bringing with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound rose more than 1 per cent against the dollar to $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49 per cent at 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock in the market and rose 20 per cent after rival AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The deal would combine two of the world's largest brewers and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock rose 0.9 per cent after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richmont.
Not only were Richemont's latest sales figures better than expected, they also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5 per cent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5bn by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Shares in Mondi, the packaging and paper group, were among the biggest fallers on the index at 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation on the company to "sell."
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sportswear company disclosed information on its half-year pre-tax profits: an 83 per cent rise to £46.6 million.
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, the head of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers in the UK is increased, it could mean that "potential consumers will have more buying power."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labor costs to the company, Cowgill notes.
The cost might fall on the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against encroachment on Aldi's sector
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from attack by Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia ahead of Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres as well as its first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores on the way. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
Traders and purveyors of IGA have jumped in, with brands such as Simmo's, the ice cream maker from Dunsborough, offering tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners selling cut-price tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defensive strategy on September 29, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and hardware holds its annual Investor Strategy Day.
There is a lot at stake as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30 per cent of the area of Metcash's IGA stores, with higher profit margins than Metcash's eastern states IGA network.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are notoriously parochial, with IGA retailers holding a much higher market share than those in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in the west compared with 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will grab about 5 per cent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. Turnover will come from all operators, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million in sales each year and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west next year, generating turnovers of $500m and $600m respectively in these areas.
The loss of food and food sales and volumes at Metcash's high fixed expenses base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, such that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose out in a decade."
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood a member of the Metcash board would have contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen since 2010 from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which brokers products to around 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012. This reflects reduced debt financing for operations as sales and margins come under pressure.
However, the wholesaler is holding its own, and has invested more than $150 million each year in reducing the prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers refurbish stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, as well as bringing a better range of private-label products to market.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says falling prices and improving stores have added to the appeal, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to the path of increasing profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy backs Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit rather than criticism for his behaviour
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a bystander in the recent storm that has raged around her friend Nick Kyrgios. She deserves credit rather than criticism for her own behaviour, notes Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy.
A younger member of the talented duo dubbed "Special Ks," Kokkinakis was involuntarily drawn into the public eye over an incident in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the head judge twice had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen smashing his racket after cramp marred his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the youngster is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for the second spot in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I feel pretty strongly that Thanasi has just been dragged into the fray," Healy said.
He broke his racket when he lost because of cramp at the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break his racket when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of that.
But he has behaved superbly, also in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little bit harshly.
He's very mature for 19, he works hard, fits in with the squad and so on, and he's never had a problem with other players. He's appreciated in the dressing room, he trains solidly, is in good form and is quite a calm and mature young man, and as far as I'm concerned he should be judged on his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the all-important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good-for-all solution, but still supporting the Canberran's return to the team's regular fixtures.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick's elevated really quickly, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he's growing up in the public eye, and he's made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he's received. However, we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public considering those consequences.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, detaining those who tried to enter the country illegally. The goal is to dam up the flow of migrants entering the country.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants massed in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled the violence in their home countries have now pitched their tents and set up for an indefinite period on a stretch of road between checkpoints in the two countries.
But frustration grew.
As a police helicopter stayed above them, immigrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister declared it "unacceptable" to return migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
" (Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The discussion will have to take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came after the 28-nation bloc failed to forge a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking asylum who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers spoke hopefully of reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take an additional 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an extraordinary EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
But Hungary is not pinning its hopes on its neighbours or Brussels acting any time soon.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed roads to be closed and asylum court cases to be expedited.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners had been drafted in to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, rather than those fleeing the war who are eligible for protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary now define as a crime an attempt to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia, as well as include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the military deployment expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have seen days of heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs.
Orban's homeland security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said 45 people had been apprehended by authorities as they tried to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already made it further into the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now in police custody, and are charged with violations specified in the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials on Tuesday morning also closed two of seven crossings on the border with Serbia after they sent a train car covered in barbed wire to close one of those locations.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was shrouded in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and crowds tried to crowd inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands remained outside.
One group of immigrants blocked a main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National poll finds Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic nominating race, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is squeezing her in.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders, second, is backed by 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but he is supported by 15 percent of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primaries begin, a majority of Democratic voters note that it's still too early to say they've decided who they'll vote for.
But Clinton backers stand firmer behind their own choice than backers of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several demographic groups since last month's CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton has a strong lead among women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
His popularity with men has dropped considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has been lost, and she is now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton is clearly leading among older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits among liberals, but now Sanders leads that group by five percentage points.
About half of Democratic voters in the country say they will enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter say they would support him with certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It's not too surprising that Clinton's current backers are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters (35 percent) say the same of Republican number one Donald Trump.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open-ended question why they wanted her as the nominee, the most popular answer was that she has appropriate experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton backers also cited her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Given the vice president's influence on a potential presidential run, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagree.
Asked who Democratic voters would choose second to the party's nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's lead over Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if he opts out, the figure will be 30.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters think Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, yet that figure is down from 78 percent last month.
By that measure, Biden lags far behind, but the percentage of those who think he's the most voteable has increased.
However, when Democratic voters were asked what was most important about the candidate, they put opinions ahead of voteability.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for those voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden fares best of the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally feel that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree ideologically.
When you look at all of these points, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion of Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and server while she was secretary of state still raises questions, a majority of Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the issue and say the issue did not affect their general opinion of her.
But it's different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the e-mail polemic did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
More than six in 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has gotten worse.
While voters in Clinton's own party view her as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for her among all registered voters. Only 32 percent view her as honest and trustworthy, and that figure is down 8 percentage points from last month as well as 15 percentage points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
Meanwhile, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
As a rule, Sanders is considered honest, but many people don't have an opinion about him, just as they don't have an opinion about Carson.
The margin of error in the survey of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates garnered half of all votes in the new poll, leaving the others fighting for a foothold.
Republican voters nationwide still strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent in a previous CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News election debate to 27 percent in a poll released Tuesday.
But Carson skyrocketed from 6 percent to 23 percent at the same time.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well among different demographic groups and is edging out Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's approval rating has fallen the most: from 10% last month to 2% today.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6 percent.
The margin of error in this latest sample of 376 Republican voters, conducted in September, is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson on the rise in the polls: He has 19 percent support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him on 32 percent.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also found Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon to no avail, even as Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College first-year student
Nearly two years after a student died during a fraternity hazing ceremony in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains region, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during a rite of membership in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, police concluded.
Authorities say Deng's eyes were blindfolded and his back was loaded with more than a 13-pound backpack full of sand, then he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field toward the finish line.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head was hurting, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but instead, according to the accusations, waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
But they had time to change Deng's clothes, search online for information about his symptoms, as well as contact the fraternity's national president, Andy Meng, asking him for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"This is where members started to hide their ritual equipment and therefore effectively put the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blunt object blows to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity hazing with at least one student dying as a result each year since 1970," Doug Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury in favor of charging first five members with third-degree murder
Thirty-two other Brotherhood members, including Meng, also face charges of violent hazing as well as criminal scheming.
"We don't just want to hold individuals accountable. If any organization is behind what happened, whether formally or informally, they should be held accountable as well," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College outlawed the fraternity and the national fraternity dissolved its affiliation with the local branch.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be a rate hike, and the market for rising rates will crash, bond yields will rise and the economy will fall into recession.
Here's what we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will take or how long it will take.
The past provides little help in terms of timing, in terms of the economy specifically.
Since the first drawdown, the recession has sometimes taken as little as 11 months, while sometimes as long as 86 months.
The US Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a defining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why U.S. Federal Reserve officials have been so vigorous in stressing that investors should focus on that, not because interest rates are starting to be raised, but mainly on the trajectory of the time it takes for the situation to normalize.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about rate hikes has been overdone.
"The central bank's first post-global economic crisis increase will inevitably be interpreted in some quarters as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief global economics specialist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels will be the kind of cataclysmic shock that many seem to fear.
But that doesn't mean it won't have an impact.
Below is a look at how some aspects of the economy will react based on past developments:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, waiting for an interest rate hike can make the situation volatile.
Once the increase becomes a fact, the effect will not be quite so dramatic after all.
"It appears that capital yields tend to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, again possibly reflecting a lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of what happens after the central bank's increase.
Specifically, over the past 35 years or so the market is generally in a strong uptrend of about 14 per cent as we approach an increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly flat (an average uptrend of 2.6 per cent), and normality has been reached after 500 days with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche Bank, the impact on equities tends to be clearer at a later stage of the raising cycle when yields start to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but rate hikes often contribute to their arrival.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges, previously unaddressed, that could precipitate a recession.
Such is especially the case with gross domestic product, which will come closest to its all-time low before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5 per cent.
While the rate was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will stick, after advancing 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time will be different," Deutsche Bank noted.
Market participants have been braced for a Federal Reserve increase throughout the year, and all are looking forward to this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe the committee can approve an increase at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25 percent probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950, all cycles of increases have so far occurred in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after stimulus has begun," the report says.
By contrast, we have now seen an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest since the last recession ended: the record has been 35 months, and now the 74th month is already under way.
Fixed yields have also been volatile as the market waits for a rate hike, with the model somewhat reminiscent of observations on capital.
The main difference is that as the central bank changes its policy stance, its effects will be seen more quickly in bonds than in equities.
There seems to be an immediate change in the direction of bond yields at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the raising cycle, the yield on the bonds will fall immediately," Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause longer-term and shorter-term bond yields to converge, thereby flattening the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often perform better in such a situation, though "we're still cautious about looking for yield," noted Schwab fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Remarkably, Jones believes the market has already adjusted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"Beyond the strength of the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more flat, credit spreads have increased and volatility has increased - all of which are characteristic of markets at times when the central bank has tightened its stance.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with high levels of debt perform worse when the rising value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have financing.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks in general are more profitable in the three months following the first rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients.
Firms with strong turnover outpaced those with weak turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage points) for the former and 3 (percentage points) for the latter.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable-rate debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers, too, have the opportunity to benefit from a rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also turn a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the impact will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses channel of 'folks-up'
He argues that separating it from a commercial rival is becoming increasingly tricky
In addition, he targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they merely mimicked the Brit Awards
Fellow MP Damien Collins criticises The Voice, saying it's not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding to pressure on the production company to prove it is doing something commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel appeared to be "nationalising" its content, and that it is becoming increasingly tricky to distinguish from a commercial rival.
"It seems like Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term "nation savvy" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, started last year, just seem like a Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can remember directly, when in fact you're just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC's director-general denied the charges, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and information sharing with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and musing is, in fact, first-rate.
"On top of that, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and commissioning new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, argued that the channel needed to do more work than in the past to reach audiences because Britons know less about classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial rivals during the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee hearing.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, a music competition bought by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22m.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and it is by no means distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this programme on BBC1, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, has been produced "quite in the style of the BBC."
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside your own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
But he refused to stop future seasons of "The Voice" from being produced, or to order that the permit payers' money be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rise least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose 7 percent in first three months of 2015
There was a rise last month was the lowest since statistics began in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were bolstered by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe November's Black Friday may curb spending
Virtual shopping has soared for more than a decade and turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of flatlining online sales in the air after the latest figures showed a rise of just 7 per cent for the first quarter of 2015.
August's total consumption grew by the least since statistics began in 2000: just five per cent up on last year.
Experts say there are signs of flatlining online sales in the air after the latest figures showed a rise of just 7 per cent for the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened as shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people shopped online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as, say, a sofa.
But now it's leveling off, and (growth) can go down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been cited as one of the reasons behind the slowing deals.
Experts believe consumers will curb shopping ahead of the event on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more shoppers than the usual average swarmed to their computers to grab bargains, crashing the Web sites of many merchants.
Experts believe Black Friday, which prompted shoppers to argue about the findings, can curb shopping sprees
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound in five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
Meanwhile, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca hoist crane crash, sanctions on Bin Laden family
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 dead through the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Department of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured when a crane collapsed down
Twenty-nine dead were carried through the streets in the air as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourners dressed mainly in white filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A mournful procession passed the holy site where just a few days ago a crane toppled through the roof of the mosque and toppled worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial as Saudi Arabia's king confirmed the Bin Laden family's construction group was responsible for the disaster, which also left 394 people injured.
Bodies of 29 of the worshippers killed by a fallen crane at Mecca's Grand Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton in the Manchester area. He was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands keep arriving in the city.
Today King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decision published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English-language service did not mention that detail, but it did say that company executives have been banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall on the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathering ahead of a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released communications about the crane collapse, and its representatives have not been reached for comment.
The royal ruling also accused the group of failing to use up-to-date safeguards and failing to cooperate with meteorological authorities.
Around Mecca's Grand Mosque are scores of cranes, part of a huge building heist led by Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades, and runs major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which any able-bodied Muslim must make at least once in his or her life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of those who died, as well as to those who were permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European workmen working cheaply are behind popularity
Britons are increasingly using helpers' services, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
200 more Screwfix shops aimed at tradesmen to open as a result
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent For The Daily Mail
Britons are said to be giving up their hammers and paintbrushes, preferring to hire skilled Eastern European labourers to do home refurbishments
It seems that if you're nifty with a hammer or a hack at painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
You see, Britons are increasingly hiring helpers to run do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, according to the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new general manager of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home renovation stores, said the popularity is driven by the number of skilled labourers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at derisory prices.
This will lead to Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workmen and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of 10 shopping decisions made in the store are specifically made by the fairer sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more one-woman households with more home refurbishments than there used to be.
Laury said: "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
But half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions to buy products are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead the most important companies in Britain's FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team to have equal numbers of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50 per cent women in the group, including its chief executive as well as its finance director.
Ms Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women for the leadership team.'
Kingfisher reported declines in both half-year profits and sales after the group took a swipe at the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is set to open 200 new stores
The government of three aces decided to resort to compelling legislation to save the country's economy.
In fact, visible effects were obtained pretty quickly.
The sharp end of SAK and other employee centre organisations started to be forced right away and as a result the country stands on Friday because of the widespread protest of workers.
For many people, this also makes sense.
Asking if it's worth going on strike when things are going badly anyway.
A resistance movement has even been set up.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to say that they will not take part in the demonstration but will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, such a thing would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online place to protest, but openly declaring yourself a miscreants would have been the political suicide of a small person.
A protest by a few tens of thousands of trade unions with millions of members is not much to worry about, but it does give food for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone feels the movement's goals are their own, values have changed
From the point of view of how interesting the trade union movement is, the government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of things seeming to roll on their own, the unions are now finally getting to the point of defending workers’ rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to strengthen the role of the trade union movement when membership in a trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
No matter what we think about the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has long since stopped.
Industrial production, for example, has fallen for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta to make massive savings: Targeted savings of 8.5 million, personnel to be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings programme that aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start employee co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million annually.
In practice, that means a reduction of about 130 employees.
An additional $2 million will be saved from other activities.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which foresees a deficit of 8.5 million euros.
It will also be affected by government spending cuts.
This financial year, the university will post a deficit of about 2.6 million.
Expenses will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined impact of the massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant,” says Rector Anneli Pauli.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Talks with the trustees will be launched on Tuesday next week and last for the six weeks stipulated by law.
Onnibus wants to join Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the biggest rail companies in Britain," says Souter.
Rail services are to gradually open up to competition.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus’ plans.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions about interest rates
The rest of the world will be watching from the sidelines as the US Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
As Reuters polled 80 economists, little more than half of those who as recently as last week believed the central bank would raise interest rates now believe the situation is not yet resolved and rates will be kept at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event as it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are getting closer to a situation where a key central bank has a chance to get out of the zero level and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institue for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars to balance sheets as well as creating little inflation.
But the central bank cannot ignore a less rosy global outlook.
It has warned markets that they need to be ready for a lift, but signs also indicate they believe the odds are against an increase.
The decision will be announced at 8pm (CET) on Thursday.
Delta State University shooter leaves apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she was "sorry" about the first murder and hoped "you could call it off," law enforcement officials said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called 911 about 10 a.m.
Monday and said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that police must send constables to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house who "doesn't bother anyone" but is probably upset.
Police asked the caller for his name, but he wouldn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When police reached the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss along with a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb that read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could retract it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said there was no conflict of any kind between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that "clearly there was something on Lamb's mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite allegations published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss had been in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no record or evidence" of any kind of "triangulation drama."
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described her as a "good person."
The pair split 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked."
Mr O'Steen said Mr Prentiss and his daughter were "absolutely the best of friends."
Linsday Knowles said Prentiss worked online from his home. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When officers reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over to the side of the road, left it there and took off running into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb debated education at Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a résumé on the university's Web site.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years
In 2001, she had leukemia, and in 2009, her longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
Rumors have also surfaced that he has a history of drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months with double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hopeful Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle on Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into PSV territory.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the pitch and had to be given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and is now in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow, or maybe the day after that, and then have surgery in Manchester.
This is horrible, the kid comes to Manchester United at 18, suffers difficulties and then plays great, and now this is what happens.
When I was in the locker room, he had his oxygen mask on.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor but a double fracture will take at least six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get only a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not penalize the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian trustee got it wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it was a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted the following: "Thank you to everyone for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffer Luke Shaw incident and lose to PSV
The English defender has the added incentive of a recovery ahead of next June's European Championship in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a really bad injury."
If any player is forced out with an injury like this, everyone is very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno is taking this hard because the intent is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn’t see it in that situation.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how tricky this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.'
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows the Lorax better than this?
Every parent soon learns one thing: If your child loves a book, it won’t be long before he or she learns it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favourite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss's The Lorax, an environmentalist story published in 1971.
It was a tricky choice, Cameron writes in a post on the SuperCamps company website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron presumably describes the book's plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details had been added to fill in the fairly short original text.
"In the walled city of Tarville, where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted the boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see a real tree," the text says, describing a love story not written by Dr Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this isn't suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text sounds in places like it was taken from a plot summary of a Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In the walled city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, son Ted hopes to win the heart of the Audrey girl of his dreams."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the book's plot. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, tree-hugging and need-weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, moustachioed creature that gave the story its name, Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text must have come from Mr Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Mr Cameron's staff but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad but it was still a tough one
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see the type of team England have picked for the tour, I don't think a repeat of last time's 3-0 series defeat is likely.
I wouldn't rule out an away win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team of three years ago, but there are some good spinners involved and the mindset of the team is strong: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing on his spiral pitches and Adil Rashid is a striker option, although is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out of the squad is understandably tricky to analyse for me because I am his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven games have been against good strikers in challenging conditions, and the simple but stark truth is that cricketers are judged on their results.
There was no uncertainty about Joe Root's selection, for example, before the announcement because, as I have said before, players are the best choice makers.
A hundred or so more points, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire another chance will come up front.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he wasn't performing quite as well as he could have and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.
It's tricky to answer the question of how long a batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as was Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got the chance to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England first picked Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean when Lyth was in top form, but that missed chance is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and that's a hitter I appreciate.
There is something about him as a cricketer that we at Yorkshire saw early this season when he scored 236 against us on the pitch at Trent Bridge.
You have to give him at least the same chance as everyone else before him, but of course this depends on the make-up of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen at batting opener next to Cook has been balled up, which would get an extra pitcher on the field but keep four quick ones, and I'm not against this.
I don't see why a batter couldn't bat there, and this left-hander has already shown he's quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job at his county Worcestershire but he is number three for them and there is little difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 games to his first wicket falling, before going on to open in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and didn't reminisce about the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup pitcher, and, with what little I've had to deal with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished stats - batting average 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many pitchers on offer and the selectors picked youngsters.
He's learning a lot on this tour.
Outside the squad, England seem to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant to games could prove to be a stroke of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings a huge amount of experience because he's done everything in all situations and against all sorts of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the white ball games, and brings both energy and a relentless glimmer.
I always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was playing or coaching, and he has the same sort of exploitable wicket as Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can refresh a team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team-mate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested in the one-dayers, Root was given a similar break against Australia and at least I have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don't make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their job depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those in favour of the UK leaving the EU (Brexit) can take a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU run into more and more problems by the day, even without taking into account even the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it a yes or a no?" about Corbyn's election to the Labour leadership or the trade union confederation's anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A fellow European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deeply entrenched in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some member states are fed up with Britain's self-centred agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these nations, for the most part, do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it too did not want them if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and finance minister will be late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home saying they will win backers for reform.
It's all about me.
My European pal who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," they say from Berlin - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care we stay then we leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautious and moderate chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it is ruined in the same way that happened to Mrs Thatcher (11 years), Mr Mitterrand (14) and Mr Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the Selfie Brits when their energy would rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they don't want that either because of similar separatist tendencies of their own.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even be planning to deliberately make unhelpful remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was an organised affair" and "The renegotiation had no bearing on the UK."
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how voracious Fleet Street newspapers can be and how EU-sceptic press sovereigns are, which they were not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely recall Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself writing about "the EU's straight bananas" when he was Brussels correspondent in the early Nineties.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley crew of tax-averse crooks, phone-hacking foreigners, as well as individuals who are nominally based elsewhere and own most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought exactly the same of them, but realised that if you're caged with a lusty gorilla, you have to give up bananas for subterfuge unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later still at dinner.
In fact, Mr Miliband was more Blairite than Mr Blair himself, in terms of opposing Mr Cameron's renegotiation trick, namely that Mr Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Mr Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me kindly on the back at Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), would seem in danger of re-embracing Neil Kinnock's Eighties boycotting Murdochia strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
However, while it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to liaise with the media. Not with me, but no doubt with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official status in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, the majority of people outside of the UK Independence Party Ukip war paint zeal, as well as the fiercest nationalists in the Conservative Party, can certainly line up behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week, when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a gritty John McDonnell as finance minister in the shadow cabinet was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father-in-law was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat.
Hilary's struts were more appealing.
But the fight to keep up with "anything in the situation" - Benn's dictum - was not what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corbyn told premiers and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember, he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is an apt breeding ground for paranoia and deceit.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Mr Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic tortuousness about EU membership (and being in line with their Benn-esque regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just an abstruse debate among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his ambivalence about NATO (Tom Watson is convinced Corby will not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they, too, have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be utterly pointless?
The US is already somewhat disappointed by the British poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday's launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's e-cigarette review
Researchers have said the state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones was prompted by a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this "milestone" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several scientists have questioned the data's durability and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published an editorial last month attacking the "exceptionally shaky bottom line" of PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say the public's expectation that PHE's claim "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people who developed a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in a study.
Mr McKee and Mr Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company name EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive is reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
He also backed BAT's public health mandate in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from the e-cigarette maker, but not the funding he reportedly received in the past from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom also say in the study that they have received funding from the industry.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's director of tobacco.
The study produced by the group "vastly acknowledges" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence regarding harm in the vast majority of products and in the vast majority of criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, says claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who smoke for life die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, particularly when there is so much public misinformation about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2bn each year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the harms of conventional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC would do well to drop EastEnders, says former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" for hits such as this soap set on Albert Square, for example.
Mr Johnson said licence fees should only be used to make programmes that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticised the BBC for putting programmes from the public service, which are likely to have smaller audiences, on tricky airtimes against the most-watched programmes from rivals and on such channels as BBC4.
After Tony Hall, the BBC's director-general, said that the corporation wanted to work more with other organisations, Mr Johnson said that he tried Channel 4 back in the day for six years to forge a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that would clearly suit unsubsidised competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is upheld - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voice is being broadcast at the most important airtime because of a desire to garner as much support as possible for its future.
The idea of no one else showing the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Mr Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, admittedly carried out in-house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for that.
I don’t understand why this is a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would undermine the BBC at all.'
Mr Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 between 2004 and 2010, said the BBC was guilty of hunting down viewership "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows are reminiscent of those of former Sky executive Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience public service programmes "go to BBC4, where often you can't measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thereby fulfils its remit and then, in defending £4bn of licence fee revenue, can hypocritically state that 'of course, we do all these unknown programmes that nobody watches'."
They put them on a broadcast site where no one ever comes to see them.
On the licence fee, Mr Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think £150 a year gets you a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is big money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its Reith-era remit to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output is now classified as education - he said the figures were 1% TV production and 0.1% radio - and that it should take its cue from the Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and change the mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
As for partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like the Proms concerts, which he said are only shown on television by a few, and team up with commercial companies in such a way that these would all be available to watch online.
'Sound genetics' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows the nematodes changing direction as soon as they are hit by the sound impulse.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered neural systems so they can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
The tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sonic impulse too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically engineered motion neurons with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity With Light
The researchers said the worms demonstrate the functionality of a new method, dubbed voice genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate specific brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method may one day replace deep-brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are conducted into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified ultrasound waves, which then travel inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures that are present in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
To make ultrasonic nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they turn on the modified motion neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says there may be some advantages to using sonogenetics over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along an optical fiber to a desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unimpeded, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic virus, it may be possible to cause the targeted human nerve cells to momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to your home!
Adverts put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch Amnesty International's anti-gun fair video.
Terrifying killer machines!
Ankle-crushing leg irons!
Grape bombs!
As well as electric stunners that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and the imagery of the comics leaves no doubt that this advert for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody, produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to peddle arms to repressive regimes at a party being held at Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in London's docklands.

A separate campaign also saw many posters popping up at bus stops and on subway trains, demanding a closer look.
"Important briefing, Will you be travelling on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" one asks, using the font and branding of the London Underground, with the DLR track changing to the image of a tank.
This September, a horde of gun dealers will arrive on the DLR route...Customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters were made by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy's Museum of Dismaland's Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute the posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs." At issue is a £6 pack of hex keys that, according to the collective, "accesses a third of the entire planet's advertising space for bus stops."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorised "poster vandalism."
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on the resistance fronts when they have realized that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun-trafficking poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times over the past 24 hours via Facebook. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and a graphic designer and background commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Leverin observed that the gun fair wasn't advertised at all - and there was also a blank spot on ExCeL's calendar then - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic advert for a shady corporation, but "it was more halting to stress the point with bright colours and animation."
"They've done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment being sold at the fair," says Amnesty's Tom Davies.
Now the UK Government must take action to ensure that instruments of torture are not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art for the arms fair comes from inside ExCeL, with exhibitors peddling fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed it had received an order from the US military for a "shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique pipe charge warhead that exerts excellent effects behind the armour inside the target."
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dormitory
It's been 11 years since, as an ignorant 19-year-old, I moved into a student dormitory. Back then, I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now can I remember the forced smiles of the people I irritated - and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from getting on your nerves to completely scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, whether you took a gap year and where you think of Corbyn, and why "I seriously don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA I'll be found in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others catch their breath, too - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and not the ones you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights and general hangouts, but they're also where people dress up and mend their underwear.
Related: Don't even imagine starting college while you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from room to room that is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can recapture the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
On knocking when it came to talk: knock.
A guy in my student dorm felt that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college at the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a plate of chocolate brownies and introducing yourself seems somewhat less odd, less like "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from a '50s person.
Offering self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and they may even associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly blended flour-sugar blobs of fat are likely to make people just pretend to sleep while you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It's quite possible that they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy - but try to take a more grown-up view of it than my dorm mate, who mixed detergent into her milk to punish those who stole it.
He is now in prison.
You shouldn't make noise so that people can't sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial cauldron bashing the kettle.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbour if they could play their drum and bass music more quietly because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to turn up the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting on her own music blaring, locking her door and leaving for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm as you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered a dorm partner to be your future spouse, teamed up, separated, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him.
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot dorm partner really isn't your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your bottom line.
In the exhilarating moment you discover someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between trick-or-treating and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be undone in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson in safety by hiding something - but never clutter someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drip the keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't attach their possessions to the ceiling with a blue sticker more than twice, at most.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - House planned as reception centre was trashed in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on foreign students’ accommodation in Kitee, North Karelia, in the early hours of Saturday.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, this is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but sleeping quarters for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Evangelical People’s College of Kitee.
The windows and walls of the Folk High School's accommodations were smeared with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the accommodations' windows, according to police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who is in charge of youth social guarantee education at Kansanopisto, there were an estimated ten people in the building affected by the vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was the weekend and adult people are free to move around, so some might have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The school houses people of 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the embattled building has a-status.
Some are studying in an adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A status is a continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a breach of the domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There is no panic here and no one has wanted to go away.
We have had more than a dozen years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkanen, the messes have already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men are suspected to have been involved and were travelling in a light-coloured passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been defaced in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
The incident happened last week.
It was reported by MTV on its website Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and the words "You are not welcome" were written in English.
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people who lived in the building.
State shuts down Y-train for Cattle - passengers snarled, "absolutely idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raseborg will stop running in March.
The news outraged passengers boarding the early evening service of the train in question at Helsinki's main railway station.
In particular, the shutdown will hit Siuntio residents, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
Absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and those who work need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be down to nothing more than political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There will also be train changes elsewhere in the Uusimaa region.
The H and R trains on the main line will be merged into a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will remain out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services during the next contract period.
The contract period will change at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year deal, to be finalised in the autumn, will be approved later by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio thinks that the state train cutter is a short-sighted operation.
We make the same mistakes that we have made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes the regret.
The Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntioans, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further than the city area by train.
"It's specifically miserable for those who have to re-plan their journeys," he said as he pained his way onto the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
There will probably be a new train connection to the shoreline, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, which will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to estimate the cost accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million per year for the Y-train, although the Ministry has paid much more than this.
On the main line, the incoming R line misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, however, the number of train services will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease to operate in the whole country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki routes.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train services will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys will be made on the discontinued services per year, while the total number of journeys in the transport purchased by the Ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to provide the state with annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on the topicality of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his major work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SVP, in Marx's The Timeliness of Capital, to be published today.
"He is being taken more seriously now than he has been in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s assessments of the development, internationalization and penetration of capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of financial capital and fictitious capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The list of authors of the book, which is based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen, also includes Aalto University professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever."
Surely the former CEO of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist?
Oh, no.
Korkman tells me over the phone that he doesn't think Marx is a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that a history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman reflects.
But Korkman nevertheless sees value in Marx’s radical stance.
"What's more relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions," she says.
Now we are again discussing Marx’s interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx can perhaps provide inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world changing as a result of technical upheaval," Korkman analyzes.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is of no help.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be put to rest.
Marx, however, is worth looking into.
"In the "70s, you couldn't read Marx," says Korkman.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hated each other".
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx, too, can be approached without the ideological and political baggage of years past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as well as other classics," says Korkman.
U.N. calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The United Nations is calling for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, AFP news agency reports.
A U.N. report on the 1983-2009 civil war appeared Wednesday after a lengthy postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lanka's armed forces and rebels known as the Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in Sri Lanka's civil war.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, a major offensive by the armed forces in the final months of a long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report insists.
The report accuses Sri Lanka's armed forces of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely to be men as women.
The rebels have been found guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters, according to the report.
Both sides have committed murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded Wednesday that it plans to hold the inquiry itself but will not allow the creation of a U.N. tribunal because of foreign judges.
England's yo test allowed to punt on social media
The autumn matriculation examination was held on Wednesday in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 aspirants tested their English skills.
You could write a subject on social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250 word essay in English could be addressed to the keeper of the online magazine's advice column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the Finnish recliner of Leelia.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects to choose from.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses Mia Lybeck, a lecturer in English at Porvoo Swedish High School.
The third topic was just a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one, Lybeck said, was a good one.
It had to write an incendiary piece about why companies should hire young people for jobs.
"At least in our school, we've practiced speechwriting," Lybeck says, and rates the whole experiment "pretty normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English exam allowed you to answer questions about texts that reflected, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
Some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when it is the turn of another domestic test, i.e. the Swedish or Finnish test.
In upper secondary schools, the test is held normally, which means that the employees’ demonstration does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges aspirants to find suitable transport connections in time for the test session.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not caused by your own negligence.
Shop robbed at gunpoint in Oulu
A shop in Kello district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothing and a commando beanie covering his face.
The man is of normal body and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and made off with a small amount of money.
The matter is being investigated as aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
A demonstration against the government's cuts decisions will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
As many as tens of thousands of people may arrive, according to preliminary data.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions will meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police officers are also believed to be taking part in the protest.
The task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out alert tasks and other policing, but also to ensure the smooth running of the gigantic demonstration.
Roads leading to Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles from around 9.30am to 2pm.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie.
Are there enough people in the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems enough is enough.
I do not take a stand on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols are coming to Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland due to the demonstration.
The exact patrol numbers are not being reported by police.
"There's some way to go, but as a rule we'll be fine on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging people to avoid private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic slump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from early morning until early evening.
With protesters arriving from other parts of Finland, there are also many charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed on the railway.
Buses are initially very far away.
The rest of the way, you have to walk to the protest site," Kujala says.
The demonstration will also bring public transport in Helsinki to a standstill.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of smooth public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings, will now be taken care of by itself.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the protest to go off peacefully.
After all, people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
They are reasonable and calm people,” Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held across Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is extraordinary in many ways - remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history,” says Martti Siisäinen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the union protested.
If it didn't, it would put hands up in front of the government," Siisiinen says.
The very right-wing government has struck at the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grip on contract law is lacking.
There are a lot of reasons to try to bring the trade union movement to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday’s demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration creates among those whom the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people gathered in different parts of Finland to demonstrate at Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday’s demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, says Siisäinen.
Organised in the midst of the deepest recession, Breakthrough Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Aho’s (central) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and the wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as during the bourgeois government of Aho.
The relationship between the government and the union is perhaps even worse now than it was at the time of MurroThursday.
Besides, Finland’s toughest bourgeois government ever is now in power, Siisäinen says.
The current government coalition is still interesting in the way that it is so hard right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
There were still some elements of the old Labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and possibly close kindergartens and schools.
Even if the protest does not receive the undivided support of wage earners, it could become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have taken place in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful – even though the operating methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict and are law-abiding.
Demonstrators are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiinen says.
But the late 1990s brought new winds.
The protest culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters' strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric strikes
The most important strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal workers took part in the metal workers' strike.
The strike was halted by a motion from the reconciliation board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
Metal men received a 16 per cent pay rise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused blackouts across the country.
Breakthrough Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered outside Parliament House, many made redundant by the recession, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest, if not the longest nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed to the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in a rain of eggs as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
To Espa, farmers dumped tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened a strike and mass resignations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass resignations ultimately spurred the negotiations to a result.
Doctors went on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - out of necessity," was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted five months and prompted a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors" salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched for student financial aid from Senate Square to Parliament House in Helsinki in 2013.
Central Bureau of Investigation investigates background of Finnish truck full of refugees for Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Bureau of Investigation for help in investigating the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim, near the German border, with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known whether the truck may have been on its way to Finland.
Those on the cold truck were all in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and primary responsibility are at the scene in Austria, according to Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria by lorry suffered more severe injuries.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by asphyxiation.
According to YLE, which first reported the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant and its CEO is a man of foreign background, aged about 40.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for human smuggling.
Refugee-busting captain, ex-drug courier and deep-pocketed businessman - the story of five smugglers
A wealthy kingpin of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary and a self-styled taxi driver.
Such people, for example, are involved in smuggling people into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book, Death Travel, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they show off the tentacles of human smuggling, offer suggestions for solutions and introduce smugglers from different parts of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat the shit out of them right now.
Kerkenna islands on Tunisia's eastern coast do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer getaways.
In terms of location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for the fisherman to transport people.
That's what the Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it can hold up to 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five deputies who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring huge numbers of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis flared up again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that the customers can just about stay alive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if a customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We go out on the water at midnight with extinguished lanterns.
The first night is driven off the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven to Lampedusa the following night.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in waves 20 feet high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and the Emir embarks on the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the hangers-on to death.
He says in the book that once the police caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one by the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from sub-Saharan Africa.
They say his countrymen are going to have to batter this one out for this one.
I'll beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a normal taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter motor is pulling last and anyway it's seen its best days.
But the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village, where families are mainly allowed in.
In the forests surrounding the city centre, men travelling without their families are housed in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, something that now anyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private residences, but that's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða region, a major hub for human smuggling, people are deathly tired.
Goran's rides are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran boasts.
He says Africans are trying to haggle.
That's not what Goran likes.
Go on, go on, go on, go on.
First, agree a price of, say, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," she says in the book.
Mr Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges just €50 a person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about 100 miles away, most of it on a nice highway.
Colleagues, they say, are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns around €50,000 a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to carry migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran ignores that: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rideshare riders a mile from the border.
Then he points his clients in the right direction and hurtles away.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary, and it's not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, which is frequented by a large number of believers who have fled Congo, as well as a small centre to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business, moving people from Congo to Europe.
He looks to do the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
She polishes her shoes several times a day and makes sure the rubber band on the white underpants peeks elegantly from beneath the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, all-terrain vehicle and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary is not preaching, he is organizing people from Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer initially calls one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, stash your money wisely and slip into the traffickers across the border.
In order to qualify as an asylum seeker or refugee, Ugandan authorities must be told that you come from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that you have been forced to flee your home to escape violence.
Often that's true, but if it's not, the Missionary arranges for the client to have a new identity.
The old identity card will be destroyed and a replacement will be provided.
That's where the Missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police help.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, NGOs, and finally the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges separately for each step: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, managing documents for a humanitarian organization costs about 150 euros, and moving to a European country costs, for example, between 4,500 and 7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a rookie smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on call off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks bound for Britain.
He has the help of an Afghan, a French taxi driver living in London, as well as dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the people-smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver would pick up their customers, usually two to three people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They are driving on the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want, he's already done seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the motorway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the Brits.
Tom picks a suitable truck - we have to make sure it's headed just for England rather than, say, Holland - and cuts across the safety wire of the tarpaulin.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is in on it, but it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to what is wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
That should stop the police heat scanner from spotting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping the driver won't snap up the stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of the Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous people smugglers in the world.
The uppish Turk has been called a master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean landings, controlling sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scheme: chartered yachts from Turkish ports supposedly take U.S. or European families on comfortable few-day tourist cruises.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who, for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000, are transported from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
Once that's given, you've got to get on board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under the deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of the crowd in sight.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive about €53,000 after expenses for one luxury ship trip.
He does not handle the practicalities himself but hires captains, recruiters, security guards, hosts and other smaller factors to handle the jobs on his behalf.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land through front companies, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 flats he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 along with a member of parliament from the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he appears to have disappeared.
Correction 16 September 2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next week.
In her book, the American Olympic runner talks about her illness and becoming a prostitute
A new book by 1,500m runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending her career and drifting into prostitution.
Sports Illustrated magazine published excerpts from the book Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the Games in top form and ran the second best time in qualifying.
But in the finale, he panicked.
He stormed to the top at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
But 150 metres before the finish, his powers were depleted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and was overtaken one after another by other competitors.
I felt like an idiot and thought, I'm never going to run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line," Favor Hamilton recounts in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt huge pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems but were fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strange men.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a life of luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he craved the same kind of adrenaline boosts he had received when competing in athletics.
It later emerged to Favor Hamilton that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000 she was world number one in the 1500 metres with a time of 3:57.40 but was last in the Sydney Olympic final.
World champion overjoyed as union clamps down on Norwegian ski rooster: 'Direct-backed'
Norway's ski king Petter Northug has overstepped the bounds of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wrangling throughout the summer and fall, as they did last year, over an athlete contract.
While the federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, even that hasn't been good enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of their contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming season's World Cup.
The decision drew praise from two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for showing backbone," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The row between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the national team for the season so he can promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he's happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations and won't let one athlete go solo.
At the same time, he reminded that the union has given Northug financial as well as other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just for being the best.
Northug issued a statement of his own on Tuesday, asserting that he wanted to sport Norway's colours next season at the World Cup as well as afterwards at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six world championship medals in her career overall, including two golds.
He was part of the team that won the gold medal in Falun last winter.
The Day of the Bake Turners is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. day, 25 September, there will be stunts in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the S.H.I.E.L.D. plate.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality expertise in the food sector and to lower the threshold for going to a restaurant, as well as to raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki metropolitan area, but that there are top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is organised at Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town participates in shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
The decision has been made to make the event one of the most significant international events organised on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-magazine: Kauhava reception centre has been opened for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are co-operating to establish a refugee reception centre at the Kauhava ex-Varuskunta premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure is still permanently located in the area during the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and their partner, Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine reports that according to the private person, placing the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests related to the area of the former Air Force Academy and the airport, the impact of which has also not been determined in the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
For the last two years, negotiations have taken place on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy, among others.
A private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about a principled objection to the reception centre, but that the planned site in the former garrison area is wrong.
The city of Kauhava’s city government dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters at nightfall after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concerns about managing the refugee situation united all participants.
He considers it valuable that the government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamental issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we have big challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
He is optimistic about the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
The NATO issue was also discussed.
On the labour market situation, the president did not take a position.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closed for a couple of hours
One flight is already cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia says that during the work stoppage, the airport operations will be managed by supervisors.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checkpoints and other service points.
Protest closes streets of Helsinki city centre
The protest on Friday will close streets in central Helsinki.
Police say streets leading to Railway Square will be closed to cars from about 9.30am to 2pm.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police said the lockdown period would depend on the number of people attending the protest.
Only emergency vehicles will be allowed into the area.
Metro and streetcar drivers in all-out protest Friday
Metro and tram drivers will take part in Friday's demonstration from the start of morning services to the end of night services.
The Tram and Metro Staff Association told STT this evening.
Majority of Alkos closes for two hours, including post offices closed
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruption to Post Office services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
The majority of postal service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross transports blood despite the strike.
Efforts are also being made to handle meal transports as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information about the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of the Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
Pam, the service sector trade union, has instructed its workers to stop work between 11am and 1pm.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to take part in a demonstration by trade unions.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the stores will be kept open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki kindergartens partially closed
The day-care centres in Helsinki will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education informs.
Due to a protest by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and there will be no club activities in day care centres and playgrounds.
Round-the-clock kindergartens, as well as groups of mentally disabled and multi-disabled children, will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren will be held as normal.
The Department for Early Childhood Education will announce further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s speeches on television and radio are one channel among others.
This kind of direct-talk channel will also be needed in the future.
It won’t be the last time, he told reporters.
He did not want to estimate how often the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches would become a frequent occurrence.
According to Sipilä, the speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle’s channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then we'll see.
“We’re going to use that channel tonight,” he said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires giving television and radio speeches to citizens.
What we are talking about here is quite complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up with this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
Taking a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech does not indicate a more general inward turn of the government.
Is the intention to take the right to define public debate more firmly into one’s own hands and refuse to be asked questions in the public debate?” says Professor Anu Koivunen from Stockholm University.
It reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini’s recent comment that he does not follow the media’s agenda and does not let it define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policymakers are not matters of notice in a democracy.
By definition, it is the job of media representatives to try not to take politicians" agendas as givens.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more on offer today that we've already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a grand gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
It is also a risk if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as the media of politicians or parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle’s interests or general policy.
A sneaky bet from Sipilä
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in Sipilä’s forthcoming speech, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuuti, the TV talk is a clever move by Sipilä, because this way he can express his own views without the use of gravel sounds.
This will provide a large audience for the message without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a news conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
They ignore the media and speak directly to the people.
There is a risk, however, that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions can be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - does the sweat drip, do the hands tremble.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If your pet can do it well, it can work.
The situation is different from when the government would inform about something, because here it is as if the person is speaking directly to the other person.
This is what (U.S. President Barack) Obama and associates do on a regular basis.
Truly exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to citizens to be truly exceptional.
He says it hasn't happened for decades that the prime minister speaks directly to the people.
Extraordinary time requires extraordinary means, says Railo.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Workers' organisations are holding a protest and strikes against the government's actions on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that Sipilä could deliver his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that he will challenge Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can’t hide forever from Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Texas.
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
THE BOY IS FOUND AND FINE," the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The National Police Department also confirmed this.
The boy went out to play at four in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he could not be contacted again.
Dad thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
Finnish UFC star disillusioned by youngster’s violent craze: You’re generating hate
Makwan Amirkhani, an MMA fighter from a Kurdish background, posted a video on Facebook with special appeal to young people from an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani made a weighty speech against street fighting by youths.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and arrived in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both his professional fights in mixed martial arts' most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the craze for young people.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking those on the ground, sitting on each other and punching without thinking about the consequences of this, what happens when you make videos like this.
Hard to justify anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Helsinki Police’s Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fight videos have been uploaded to social media by both immigrants and native Finnish youth.
It's the fact that you're basically fighting on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds.
Amirkhani points out that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite outrageously numerous.
A little difficult, boys, no more excuses for you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests here for quite a while.
That's a little different way of saying thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are ever subjected to someone's racism, then you have yourself to blame.
Think about this a couple of times before you go along with it, guys.
Amirkhani says violent action gives stakes to racism.
You make me hate people I don’t like either.
You've got things pretty bad anyway and that way you're not going to improve them at all," Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, President of SAK, says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK said it would submit its own proposal to the Government to achieve the five per cent leap in productivity demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
But it would require the largest employee organisation, SAK, to soften its previous stance.
Lauri Lyly, the chairman of SAK, made a terse comment on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK's working committee will consider the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of coercive laws, agreements made by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä’s government’s proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to the SAK.
Earlier, Sipilä broke off negotiations on the social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a five per cent productivity leap.
Commentary: A big protest threatens to fall flat - "It feels a bit funny to shake your fist"
It feels a bit funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood varies from camp to camp.
Is it to call out the government or to agree with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK exuded holy hatred towards the government of the republic.
The whole country was threatened with arrest.
The threat spread to the Akava people.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened the closure of schools and nurseries.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or kindergartens will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STTK, appeared conciliatory.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and was drafting an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) for a five per cent leap in productivity.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hastened to announce immediately that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, there was no sign of the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to agree when union leaders just on Monday told the country to stand on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that SAK's bureau would meet next Monday to address the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labor market lock."
In order for a collective proposal to be made by employees, SAK should accept a productivity leap of 5% as a target.
It is no wonder that the Fire Department has a strong relationship with the government.
Jukka Ihanus, STTK’s head of public affairs, was previously special assistant to the centrist prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola described that the government’s expertise in trade unions has been improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, Palola’s exit took a bit of a breather from the Finnish stoppers, who are fronted by ACP’s Marko Piirainen (sd).
It's a little funny to shake your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia slammed as bad host: 'This must not happen again'
Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the jubilee meeting in Helsinki in July.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union's sanctions list, to attend the meeting - an issue about which the Speaker kept reminding journalists.
Our assessment was that it went against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where he was also barred from entering.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation was able to reach Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued Finland’s efforts by praising and thanking Mongolia for its “excellent organization”.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should have no obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (Kok), who is leading the meeting in Ulan Bator, and according to Russian media, he has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
Lock faces real playoff troll: 'Goals tight'
The two of them are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual goal celebrations in Hakametsä today.
Last night, they won a 3-2 victory.
The rise was manly as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
Lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
The Blues, who started with a tangled start, had a round of zero points, and a loss of 2-3.
Tough game, goals tight, if any play the same kind of game as last year, Lukko striker Janne Lahti anticipates setups on the club's side.
It has turned into a playoff nightmare.
After all, in the past two seasons, Tappara has just dropped a lock from the final series.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been called for.
Last season, Lock took the series to a halt already in the fourth game, but Tappara stepped up in the next three alongside and passed.
With the exception of the goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will get a flutter today.
With Tappara's goal Mika Noronen makes way for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Viewpoint: A miserable play under way in the Aces
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the screenplay for the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put up a fight for world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, despite eventually losing the title match.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote a disturbing Cinderella story for Pori.
To everyone's amazement, the anonymous and wood-handed pot pack progressed to the SM-finals 2006.
The team was filled with anonymous but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, a Porin Mattia and a Pele Peltonen.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
She turned blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver won.
Hope was one of the heroes.
Screenwriter Toivola believes that this season’s novelty piece will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for aces has built a cauldron on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been pummeling dudes in the rink like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen lie in something other than puckish play.
Toivola has forgotten that the main character in Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has christened Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy a lead actor in Toivola’s screenplay Rocky as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's nothing more Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
Iron Rock's playing philosophy doesn't include rushing and little hogs.
He appreciates playing hard, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces tackled Tapparan Jere Karjalainen to the head.
She got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We play only those who deserve it.
I don't approve of that kind of game and it's not part of ace hockey," the hot-tempered Rautakallio snapped at the Satakunta People after the game.
The team of aces this season is oddly constructed.
There are trains, there are veterans, there are cops, there are healers.
There are virtually no key men in prime playing age.
No wonder the head coach has bemoaned the skills gap.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited,” Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's smouldering beneath the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The balance of aces in the season's three league games is the same number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
I don't think it would have been worth it to write a sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting under the guidance of her husband for the first time.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband's friend in the film.
In a way, it seems crazy," actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to Apulanna’s ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together in the past, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka’s direction for the first time.
Olga's role in 'You made us beautiful' is drummer Sipe Santapukki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka encourages and supports her son, even though his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I've gotten to know my true role model, Cricket, the easier it seems to become to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had already met Cricket before the film project, but since then the two have grown much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone and messaged.
Cricket has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Cricket also thankfully understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be coloured a bit.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the biggest band in Finland.
Back in the '90s, it was a recession and really dreary.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before the film plans.
But the parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yes, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, then how much do your parents really know what you were up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, who is known as the notorious skater of Heinola.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who would have had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At best, he could have secretly delighted.
According to Olga, she has collaborated so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that she is not afraid of a big joint project.
It's always worked out super well.
Now the whole production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iit often also plans to drive home at night because the distance is not too far.
We'll take all of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a really warm welcome, just asking which streets to clear and when.
Iron Sky 2 becomes the most expensive play film in Finland
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming begins in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film ever with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 as the film has a budget of more than €100 million.
Filming for the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is going to Belgium next week.
A giant budget doesn't scare you.
I have been so sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited and can’t wait to show this movie to the public.
The original budget for the film was 8-10 million, but as the script was developed, the budget increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story, too.
But you could stuff 100 million into a movie because every angle and effects is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there's not a single loose end.
Iron Sky Universe, the film's production company, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond today on Wednesday, paying an annual interest rate of between 4 and 8 per cent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov, among others.
Hicks or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' busts have recently been adorned with big logos.
Not so long ago, the fashion-savvy dresser avoided plain and bulky logos like Crocs for ever.
Advertising a brand of hoodie or T-shirt was seen as somewhat of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is a blur: if something is already right hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or mundane fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of a grey basic college, the sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the cupboard is now placed on top, with the manufacturer’s logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable tracksuits, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps, for example, have also made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend appears to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, Versace's autumn blouse bust makes it clear what brand of garment it is.
Are you ready to show off your logos?
The Russian politician posted the proof: I didn't get stuck for hours in the tank hatch!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015, which showcases products of the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, colorful claims have circulated in the Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations had to remove the large-sized Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook pages, in which he seems to be peering through the hatch of an armored vehicle in quite good moods and, at least based on those images, it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
It's absolute nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, a lieutenant colonel, having served in the Urals.
I went inside there, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Speaking to the Russian army TV channel Zotov explained that he admired the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he is a former professional soldier himself.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technology.
And out I came through the trunk,' he said.
I went in all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also slammed the journalist who wrote about it as a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was none of that.
I went in, and I came out.
I am tall and ratty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are backed up by the fact that no photographs of the alleged jam have been released, despite the fact that a total of 50,000 people attended the gun show over the course of a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck began with a story on Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov reportedly struggled to get out of the tank hatch and threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn’t get out of his way.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organisers gave their take on what had happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armoured vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his bulky stature, simply lingered when he came out.
But by no means did he sit there for five hours," Aleksandr Pisarevski, the exhibition's coordinator, told Bloknot.

The candelabra of the architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen from 1962 looks as if it were designed today.
A cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that's what it was in the first place.
The architect brothers have been known to refine the shape of the candelabra for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the Lords.
Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of the illustrious brothers.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
Refined process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings basin into a ditch.
The company said steps have been taken to fix the leak.
The basin contains neutralized tailings and purified process water from the flotation process.
Usually, the water is pumped either to be reused as process water or to be discharged to the environment via a surface drainage field.
The leak was estimated at about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
The company said the quality of the leaked water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material was spilled into the environment.
The leak was discovered during a round of inspections on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures in the basin.
The company said it is working closely with authorities to monitor and rectify the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danske's Pitfalls: IMF Warns Against Cutting Too Much
Finland’s country report published today by the International Monetary Fund largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to implement comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
The IMF said that reducing overtime pay and paid days off would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed to the entire treaty system as well as unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a lot of message in the IMF's assessment that is sympathetic to the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of caution about what should not be cut too much.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to Taloussanomat.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4 per cent for Finland for this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
In its new forecast for the economic cycle, Danske predicts that growth will remain at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis of the latest sightings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention may again have been paid to weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer metrics.
However, there are only a few percentage differences.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new director
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of the 65-year-old Kimishima comes as no great surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research, told Reuters.
Kimishima's task is seen as taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but in such a way that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional games consoles.
More and more asylum seekers are arriving in Finland alone
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children were missing every year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of underage applicants disappear in Sweden every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
In 2013, 156 asylum applications were made for unaccompanied minors in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it becomes clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing are also found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3,651, of which 134 applications were closed due to the fact that the applicant had probably moved away from Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of September 6, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on underage asylum seekers missing this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is known and has clearly increased, which is also likely to have an impact on the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about the converts?
Will they also disappear into the 'dark labour market', for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the enforcement of deportation decisions, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered immigrants.
He has taken action on the matter.
Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at a meeting of EU interior ministers, on Monday outlined practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media industry who has lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Nina Mikkonen, Mikkonen’s spouse, sells equipment on Huuto.net that was once the most advanced professional equipment in its field.
The online advert was first reported by the online newspaper Ilmatakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment has been overtaken by technological advances.
In the digital media world, television shows for Betacam tapes will no longer be filmed.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident there will be some interested parties.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts – collectors and builders of their own studios, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkonens are looking to move out of their current Myrskylan home.
There is no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've been slowly starting to take stock and see which items to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for television or radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man with a long career will not return to the workforce.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s real life’s work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives picked up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to get porridge worse than thought: Metro and trams could stop all day Friday
Metro and streetcar drivers will decide today whether to extend the force in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to halt subway and streetcar service only during the rally on Friday.
In the afternoon, it will be determined whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief steward Pekka Hirvonen says the ooh is big on the field.
The cuts to night and shift allowances will severely sting drivers, so the Government's plans to cut the allowances will provoke opposition.
Hirvonen ponders that stopping traffic for an entire day is a kind of dilemma, however.
If the metro and trams come to a standstill on Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area will be almost completely at a standstill.
VR reports that trains will not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains that left before 6 a.m. will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most of the buses will remain in the depot.
ACP members are off work Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
It is likely that a small number of the buses can be driven, they will be driven by supervisors,” says Pirkko Repo, spokesperson for HSL.
Repo says HSL is unable to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employees’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, according to the Associated Press.
Sky News reports that refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled amid panic.
According to local media reports, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas after teacher mistook self-made watch for bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought a homemade watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News he just wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
But one of the teachers wore a watch that looked just like a bomb.
Police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile holding cell.
At no time has Mohamed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said officers had determined the watch looked like a "movie bomb."
The watch is in police custody but was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another manifestation of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK uproar over Labour leader's refusal to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism from the right-leaning press has also been echoed by MPs from Mr Corbyn's own Labour party.
This has offended the nation, thought Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview with broadcaster BBC.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined in the song.
Yesterday's commemoration honoured the battle of the British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, Labour defends Mr Corbyn and stresses he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroics of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully in silence during the national anthem," the statement stressed.
Mr Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour ranks.
Among MPs in particular, there are those who fear he will deter moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn advocates unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity and increased public spending.
Mr Corbyn is today due to make his first appearance as party leader in Parliament during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron took to Twitter this week to announce Corbyn's election as party leader.
Labour is threatening our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families," the prime minister tweeted on his own account.
Minnesota Family Killing Cause Still Unclear as Family's Father Faces Lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a soon-to-be weeklong family slaying in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed the gunman was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After firing a shotgun at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the home.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns were raised about the absence of children at the school.
Based on this report, officers went to the house for a check-up and found the Short family dead in various parts of the huge house.
StarTribune said it was possible the victims had been dead for days.
Million Dollars and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed remains unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on AllNurses.com, a social media site for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million different visitors weekly.
I have had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the business, but not yet.
Among other successes, the Short family bought a swanky house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate website Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house not only has 12 rooms, but also a garage adequate for eight cars.
Lawsuit pending
But according to StarTribune, the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
He had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, over comments on AllNurses.com.
Achieve Test Prep said there had been no defamatory comments about prep courses removed from Short's site and, consequently, they had lost customers to their rivals.
But according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have made much difference to Short's business.
Vesku Loiri
In addition, the trio were awarded with the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award.
This is a great idea, Loiri commented with good cheer on his honour board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and earned 100,000 euros with the win.
Artist legend Loiri was still baffled by Fabrice Duo's success in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
The success horse's trainer, Korpi, will have full labor peace while working with the horse, according to Loiri.
Peter decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri blubbered.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The biggest donation ever made by an athlete"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital statement, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising efforts for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban's endowment is significantly higher than his annual earnings of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
It's not the first time Canadiens players have significantly helped local hospitals.
Longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, for example, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order your wife from a Japanese cafe for the evening, and she will serve the food wearing only a bikini and an apron.
Coffee shops are a big deal in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a cuddle cafe and now a wife cafe on the market.
It hits the lonely, the companion-hungry and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
At Ore no Yome (My Wife) in Tokyo, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
This is a waiter pretending to be the customer's spouse.
The "spouse" is chosen from a list before entering the cafe and prepares and serves the food.
The wife is met with nothing but a apron and a bikini, the husband again in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about wife candidates, from height and weight to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be prepared for
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry,” Intel said in a statement.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security testing and inspections with the goal of standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will continue to update the report based on the ASRB's research findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the grid.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
By the same estimate, 60 to 75 percent of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share web-based data.
“We can and must improve cybersecurity in cars,” said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish security-related best practices and supports the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around €52,000 in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been waiting for years like it's going up on the moon.
The car is finally on the horizon in Finland.
Ford announced the RS at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new all-wheel-drive RS, thanks to its 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
What is also interesting in Finnish terms is the price, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available for order, although the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford said in a statement.
Kia introduced two new models at the Frankfurt Motor Show - the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly the most important of the two innovations in Finland, with which Kia intends to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created in the shape of a new European design leader, Gregory Guillaume, the Sportage is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and exterior dimensions have become one centimetre here and there and the car is splitting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo developing 177 horsepower.
More about the Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to going on sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, new Kia Optimats arrived in Finland.
It doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-end equipment.
Start with Optimos with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up with the arrival of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
Around the same time as its arrival, sales of the Optima station wagon will begin.
Chisu returned to the stage - blared in a bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is participating in the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a showy, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully showcases the singer star's graceful waist.
The crown of the ensemble is a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
The singer, who became a mother during a three-year hiatus, has shed the pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from the new record in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn't really thrill me.
I’ve missed all the music, the singer said.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release his fourth album, Polaris.
A new life situation has inspired me to make new pieces.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Stuns Again - Now You Can See Her Breast
Reality TV beau Kim Kardashian talks one after the other.
She generously shows off her pregnancy belly and cleavage in sexy clothes, most recently last night at 1am American time when she and sister Kourtney Kardashian exited husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-coloured bra underneath the dress as flashbulbs flicker.
The last time Kardashian donned an Amazonian maternity outfit was when she stopped by a friend's house for a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The outfit was accentuated by black over-the-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as recent as last week's Friday, when a pregnancy belly was on show.
Tough Laws of the Model World: No Home, You're Lonely, Competition Is Terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to short-circuit the notion that the modeling world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths off about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you've posed in top designers' outfits in the previous season, the new season starts with castings again.
And every season there are new, fresh faces entering the industry, competing for jobs with the old-timers.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
Work is constant travel and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you're very young and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to shed the pounds, but in Paris, they'll then say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risky game all the time.
At Fashion Week, models and designers are together all the time, and act as a support network at the same time.
When the fashion weeks end, the difference is wistful.
Models want to enter this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just about showcasing clothes.
Models want to be their own person.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models at the Tory Burch show yesterday.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Week, where designers are unveiling their collections for next year.
Roope Salminen plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is quite a big challenge for me, because I’m about to turn 26 as a rap artist, and in this film I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist,” Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown of the group, so I think it’s good that I’m only learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to do an impersonation of a person.
Scrooge Salminen and the man who leads the Dogs will not play the role.
Punk mannerisms come naturally to a man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure a lot of people saw a preview, as well if you've ever been to one of our shows.
Our performance has never been anything small, we always go full throttle.
Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanna from 1993 to 2004, directed the main actors of the film Teit Us Beautiful.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is played to the general public by young actors who are still fairly unknown.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temo by Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his upcoming job already last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a moustache and chin beard, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: Here's how to tell kids about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to inform their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, advises SPR crisis team member, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
Younger children should be protected and not, for example, let them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they are seeing, and it can stick in the mind and become distressing, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news footage of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is a good idea to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he or she asks.
A child’s fears can be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones a parent imagines she's afraid of.
There is no point in intimidating a child, even if you are distressed and frightened.
Younger children closely monitor the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe as well.
Older children are more likely to come across conversations about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to bring up the matter with them if the child is thinking about it.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Together with the children, parents can consider how this will be viewed in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe place or a safe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult issues, the child will get a model for how to deal with the difficulties that come up in life.
This may be useful to him in the future.

Their own strength at an end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Vermo-hitting ball lightning hard to contain
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone in on Pallosalama’s impact in mid-summer.
It was only a victory and a second place finish until the end of July when the Tampere Races collapsed.
Because the stallion was thoroughly congealed, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown became clear on the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but required two courses of medication.
Since Apila’s Pallosalama had to exercise lightly, Pohjola says he was pleasantly surprised by the horse’s recent run.
It was the second time in its record-breaking time in Turku after the SE mare Taruntuuli.
He was under a lot of pressure when he could drive normally for only a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, the slight deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that proper competition made the studs edge.
The horse's momentum certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have plateaued as well.
Clover's Ball Lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it's not amused, it can be thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, by contrast, the stallion has been dislodged by such a lightning rush that opponents have been in awe.
In short speed, fellow racers are no match for the Ball Flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
There is hope for the north in Vermo.
What is different, however, is how Clover's Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's pretty hard when you're starting out and you might even pull out from under the boom of the starting car and things like that.
I hope it’s calmer than going down.
The clover ball lightning can also come from the bow when it is in good condition, and we will drive it for the win, the coach promises.
Here's why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple plans to potentially remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, according to Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
You'll find a host of programs on Apple's iPhone that relatively few people use: FaceTime calls, Newsstands, Health, the Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind, for example.
The latest addition to those programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a must-have update for iPhone handsets, though it's only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook said removing Apple's programs is a more complicated issue than it appears on the top.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook notes to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work solidly together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them," Cook added.
So Cook said Apple is looking into it, saying the company doesn't want to waste memory space from users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation eases to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the eurozone rose only marginally, or 0.1 per cent year-on-year, in August, Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority, said today.
The rise in prices was dragged down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised down its preliminary estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 percent.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9 percent in August from 1.0 percent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate of core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the eurozone last month than a year ago.
Across the 28-nation EU as a whole, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
July saw a 0.1 percent rise.
Of the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most, by 1.4 per cent, in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a price rise of around 2 per cent over the medium term.
The ECB is forecasting an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the eurozone for this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1 percent, the central bank anticipated in its new inflation forecasts released in early September.
U.S. Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next U.S. recession will begin at its fastest pace in less than a year, but with more certainty within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, steps in to raise its interest rates again.
And in financial markets, meanwhile, the downgrade will begin before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted at possibly starting rate hikes as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
This means that the next recession could hit us at its fastest by next autumn and the course of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that will be the case if the world's largest economy and financial markets perform as they have been wont to do - and if they react to the Fed's monetary taps tightening as they have in the past.
Such conclusions have been reached by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, strategists at Deutsche Bank London market research, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed the more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its major international clients last week.
The strategists who produced the study and the report don't pretend to know when exactly the Fed will move to raise its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and markets after that.
Instead, they present economic statistics using cool facts and their calculations of how the economy and markets have behaved in the past at the time of and after the Fed's rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they will look at what key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another pattern as at the time of previous rate increases - and what might come of it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in shakier shape to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year into the recession.
Throughout last summer and early autumn, leaders deciding on the Fed's monetary policy and its respective stance have hinted that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years could come as soon as this week.
The issue will be resolved over the course of Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's board's so-called open market committee meets to decide at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
That was the end of exactly two years of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 percentage point rate hikes by the Fed to raise its interest rate from 1.25 percent to 5.25 percent.
The financial market's symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the riskiest U.S. housing finance, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time around, the severe adversity in financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically been the case since previous Fed rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and harsher than at any time since the Depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have sifted through the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the twists and turns of financial markets since 1950 and, in some places, since the early 19th century.
They make sense of the Fed's rate hikes and their economic and fiscal impact since the 1950s.
It has been less than a year since the first rate hike, usually less than three years and less than three and a half years on average.
The rise in financial markets has ended within a year-two of the Fed's rate hikes starting.
The Fed has alternately raised and lowered its key interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has differed from the others in some respects, and the narrator is relatively sparse in the examination, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of subsequent rate increases.
The strategists remind us that this time around, many things are different.
And not only better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be conclusively identified even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat indisputably clear:
1) In the 2000s, the Fed, the eurozone ECB and other major central banks in the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the marks of the tech bubble, while growing the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and which was already too high, became even greater due to the over-loose monetary policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in history.
3) In particular, the crazy cheap debt financing that packed into the financial economy almost without restraint swelled the biggest exchange rate bubbles in most parts of the financial markets to date, from equities to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor is it likely to generate very severe controversy that financial markets, which have soared to heights on increasingly convoluted leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile spot the last time the Fed and other central banks drove up interest rates.
Financial structures rigged with debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last more than their time after rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned upwards.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis, followed by the Great Recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not speculate on what will happen next, but they do give some reason to wonder, for example by mentioning the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free money.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economies has not eased, but now there is a much heavier debt load in different parts of the economy than before the financial crisis or at any time before it.
3) More liquid and cheaper than before, central bank liquidity has largely remained in the financial markets and has curbed key securities and assets to their most expensive levels since the pre-financial crisis peak or at any time.
And not only are strategists flattening the mood with warning signs from financial markets, they also point out that even the U.S. economy has yet to recover from the financial crisis and the heaviest recession in decades to the pattern that has transpired in the past.
The eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
The real economy, in other words, is in unusually weak shape but correspondingly the pressures and risks in financial markets are incomparably greater than they were before the financial crisis, when the Fed next moves to tighten its monetary taps tighter.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards, strategist at Societe Generale, the French bank, is not as strange as it may seem.
For a good while, he has been grooming the bank's international investor clients for the Fed's following turnarounds:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it will be time for the Fed to race to put out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which makes computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The vast majority of the reductions will be in HP's business services side, the company said.
HP is splitting into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which focuses on enterprise sales, and HP Inc., which focuses on PCs and printers for consumers, in November.
HP's headcount peaked in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company will record non-recurring charges of $2.7bn (about €2.4bn) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise to shed 25,000-30,000 employees.
Reductions on the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60 percent of its employees will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already rebalanced its business so that none of its customers accounts for more than 10 percent of its operating results.
Last year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 per cent of EBIT.
iOS 9: how to get new operating system on iPhone after Apple update release
To request a new operating system, go to the Settings app, click "General" and then select "Software Update."
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation when a "Software Update Failed" error message appears on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst of the backlog to pass or attempt an update via the iTunes program.
The phone will guide the user through the final process.
This may include removing apps to gain space, but Apple has reduced the chance of this by reducing the size of the update and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests apps to remove and then reinstalls them as the update is completed.
You'll want to make sure your phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade to make sure you don't run out of battery.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won't let the update proceed, as if the battery runs out, it could lead to the update breaking.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a board member of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
The company in question is the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he submitted a resignation notice for membership in May this year.
I checked it out and that's enough for me to have filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg-based company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg-based company.
According to Yle, Kährs’ holdings pass through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs’ second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to ensure that the capital interests of the Finnish family company were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from Finnish companies’ capital is taxed in Finland, and this starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg-based holding company ready for the holdings.
A reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
Espoo’s Otaniemi will open the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to welcome the first 100 residents from 6pm today.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre at the former Rescue College property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly active in the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on the security arrangements of the centre.
STTK prepares alternative labour blackmail package
STTK is starting to prepare an alternative package to the government's labour blackmails.
The organization also hopes to include other employee center organizations.
Chairman Antti Palola says the focus is currently on Friday’s demonstration.
Alternative ways of reducing the price of labour will then be revisited.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out to reporters during a break in the administration meeting of the organization.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, is not ready for discussions.
Economists at STTK have calculated that the change security included in the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated 30 million euros, while the other half of the package is 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a huge amount of interest on the part of the party in having a conversation if you're getting a one-to-one ratio of 100.
Palola: Negotiation connection was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the Government is to submit a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
He did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the Government is there, and it has always been constructive for him.
According to Palola, the personnel centre organisation STTK, cutting Sunday supplements in the field is a sore spot.
The organization requires the government to back away from compelling legislation to carry out some of the extortion.
According to Palola, STTK does not warm to the possibility of preparing an alternative package with the SDP.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the government's extortion package for working life presented last week.
As part of the package, pay for first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be cut back.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to a demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, commends STTK’s announcement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now joining forces with Akava, as an alternative model for the government’s proposals has been outlined in Akava for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK, the package is not comprehensive enough.
The chairman of Akava, Sture Fjäder, hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Antti Palolan STTK said it was preparing new proposals.
We want transformational security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it had long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5 percent jump in competitiveness as an alternative to the cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of service as part of the agreement.
In return, we want transformational security and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without it, the package is not strong enough.
We will now work together to create a model that suits the government and employers,” Fjäder says.
Akava's bureau will meet at 3 p.m. on Thursday to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, let's walk" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
The University of Tampere’s Green Left’s Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given speeches on exceptions during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will address the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels at 9.05 pm on Wednesday evening.
When applying for a similar speech by the Prime Minister, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he made the famous radio address that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operators’ strike with a television address.
Solitary, monarchical
All day long, the speech has been a source of criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could deliver his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed."
According to the Greens, “I’ve already seen the monotony.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist sentiment: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months from the elections.
Not a single appearance from the prime minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is @Juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech is pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it will be commented on live television by Lauri Lyly, Chairman of SAK, and Jyri Häkämies, CEO of EK.
He has been criticized for giving a speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity that covers the whole of Finland,” says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle’s publications at Yle News.
Like We Were in Tammeloita
The speech has also provoked taunts.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom puts on the prettiest colt and my dad matches the tie to his neck.
At nine o'clock we will be silenced in front of the television as before in the time of the Tammelots," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä will also explain why there are millionaires in the Finnish government hiding their capital in tax havens, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they must cut back when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has posted an accompanying bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear tonight about the same boat, common coal, living in debt and team spirit?
Vouchers and pens ready, 9.05pm it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western nations reject Russian proposal to oust al-Assad
More than three years ago, Western countries rebuffed a Russian offer to dislodge Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari has told the Guardian.
Ahtisaari said Russia's U.N. ambassador proposed a plan to give al-Assad an elegant step down from power after some time.
But Western countries did not take up the suggestion because they believed al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian envoy Vitali Churkin listed three plans in a bilateral discussion: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted, and al-Assad’s departure from power had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Churkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell you what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats won't comment
Ahtisaari says he passed on Churkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Churkin did not confirm the content of the conversation to the newspaper, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
U.N. diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any deal to keep him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East department at the British Foreign Office, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari is saying because, in his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Churkin spoke under Moscow’s authority.
If he had told me about what Churkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Even in that case, Jenkins said, he would have suspected it was Putin's gimmick to keep power with some supporter of al-Assad.
A refugee stream of our own making
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The United Nations estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the start of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I have no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying a bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari says to the paper.
Asylum seeker settlements in Tornio
A centre for organising asylum seekers, planned by the Government for northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty Tornio joint lyceum building in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the influx of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to the vice-president of the Tornio City Council, Sauli Hyöppinen (left), this is not true.
When the whole council was not meeting and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to call a meeting of the council for next Monday to decide on the matter.
Thirty-six of the 43 delegates were present at the debate.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, one would expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city was contacted about the issue on Monday, and the response was swift.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint lyceum at any one time.
An expert has gone to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred metres from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
The Labour Market Still Wants an Alternative to Blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre), the halving of public holiday allowances would take care of only part of the reduction in the price of work sought by the Government.
But he said the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations managed to agree on one.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the labor clampdowns announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s view, halving the holiday allowance would work as a means, because it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government’s planned cut in Sunday bonuses.
The labour market organisations could agree among themselves on a cut in holiday pay, because it is enshrined in collective agreements instead of the law.
On Wednesday of next week, the Government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
He said the organization’s proposals should be known before then.
This is not the final deadline either.
This is when the legislative work starts, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting more and more difficult.
It's very time.
It doesn’t take long for this to happen, if you have the will to do it.
The government's list, published last week, includes turning Epiphany and Ascension into unpaid days off without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, pay for first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75 per cent and holidays will be cut short.
The reforms will be implemented as compelling legislation past the unions, which has drawn strong criticism.
In addition to a large demonstration on Friday, several labor unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approves expansion of the sap hall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but slightly grumbled about the expansion of Nordic Koivu Oy’s warehouse.
What caused the criticism was that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally talked about.
A busy schedule also snarled.
It was also a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of 150,000-200,000 euros on the agenda, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated price would be 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
There is no risk for the municipality, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous stance to bring street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right for the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the region’s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more a part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing, with good consideration given to each case.
The City recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language should also be treated with open-mindedness now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still unique in the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of these can be useful in many areas of marketing.
Train closures cut province's vitality
The cuts to train services will hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And that has an impact on whether we can live and work here at all,” says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raised the issue of air transport, the continuation of which has also been discussed on several occasions.
It is important for the whole region that we do not reduce our chances by measures taken by the state, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these closures, for example, on employment, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, President of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that already at the moment, marketing the university towards Western Finland is difficult, because the cross-border connections are weak.
Currently, about half of the University of Eastern Finland’s students come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel sounds for Siun sote
The Joensuu City Board’s view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel voice among them.
City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured) proposed at Monday’s meeting that the entire project be abandoned, but his proposal fell unsupported.
The Government approved Mayor Kari Karjalainen’s proposal, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meets, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, albeit less than one train service.
Passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola will be changed next March.
One train service is cancelled, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications’ rail traffic purchase funds for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be discontinued altogether.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped away from the scene
Emergency services released a 12-year-old who climbed onto the roof from the climb and was unable to get down on his own.
The situation arose in Tornionmäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
That didn't stop a group of boys who decided to climb up to the roof of the house along the radio amateur mast next to it.
Other boys made it down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that others slipped from the scene and passers-by alerted the emergency services to help pull the last person on the roof safely back down to earth.
FedEx doubles operating profit, lowers fiscal 2016 outlook
FedEx reported disheartening results for its latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, driven by weaker demand for freight services as well as higher expenses for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects earnings of $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from a previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook came despite price increases averaging 4.9 percent, effective Jan. 4, and despite higher surcharges on ground shipments of heavy or large packages that began in November.
The company said it still expects operating profit to grow from a year earlier because they have cut expenses, revenue has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive, said the company was "performing solidly given the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in production and global trade."
Plans for hires for the holiday period were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire between 90 and 95,000 extra workers, about the same number it hired last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx posted a profit of $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Profit per share came in at $2.42, falling short of the $2.44 average forecast. The survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decline in international priority shipping in recent years that has stalled revenue development at its Express unit.
However, the rise of e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the most recent quarter, the country unit's revenue rose 29 percent, but revenue from operations was basically the same because of expensive expenses on bigger packages and its own insurance.
Revenues at the Express unit were better due to higher base charges, while operating profit in freight operations was depressed by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday 11 percent down for this year and 17 percent below its June 11 record.
US Federal Reserve policymakers will sit around a huge mahogany table for two days this week in a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the central bank's ornate, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the shoulders of the Federal Reserve: They must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
Since the Great Depression, however, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that may be the decisive factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned off the record stimulus brought on by the near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008 .
While most of the data shows the economy is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made central bank officials, who are already wary in advance, even more jumpy, in terms of increasing volatility. There are fears about the impact if the federal funds rate were raised by even a percentage point quarter.
"Understandably, the labor market and inflation are the first and most important issues to watch," notes Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial specialist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for interest rate resetting, increased uncertainty in world markets is a valid enough basis to still wait," he says.
There has been no agreement on the central bank's decision, which is already generating jitters about the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the drawdown, as a key indicator suggests the chance of growth is only around 30 per cent.
This suggests a fall in securities markets should the central bank raise the level, unless policymakers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next drawdown won't happen any time soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to 16,599.85 for the new figure.
The recovery was brought on by the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, according to John Lonski, chief economic expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group cluster.
"It will be surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they will have to go to great lengths in their policy statement to support financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argue that the elevated level would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank will act.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the Federal Reserve would be on track to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step toward a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would certify the stability of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen has noted in the spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year despite liberal calls for more economic development in her complaints.
Although new job creation slowed in August, labor market growth has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest rate in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2 percent annual target, the main reason for this, according to central bank policymakers, is the temporary effect of significantly lowered oil prices.
The economy "is coping with higher interest rates and also needs them given the tight situation in the labour market," notes Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percent from its May record high as investors feared China's slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below its May peak.
For central bank policymakers, market turmoil is an additional factor in the complex equation of when to raise interest rates.
"Without these financial market events and the news coverage in recent weeks about the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would be tightening the level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a special investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, as well as a former central bank official.
Now, he predicts, policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear and they don't have much data at their disposal, in terms of the consequences of what's happening in China," Oliner notes.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, the implication by the chairman at the time, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank can "narrow" monetary expansion caused upheaval in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to get a better sense of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," notes Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that "the central bank has in the past overreacted to financial market momentum that has appeared to be separate from economic fundamentals."
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for a rate hike, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, invokes the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth," says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed those cuts.
The central bank should only give priority to financial stability during a major crisis, such as when markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't come close to its level, Posen notes.
"Nobody wants to be in a situation where there is a fear of raising interest rates because markets are annoyed," Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double requirement and does not mention financial stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's pediatric agency in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breast-feeding women
Brazil's pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by posting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake isn't the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects the babies from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise is favourite in terms of viewership, despite Nine's attempts to cover the leader reveal on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership reveal failed to boost Today's viewership.
Nine's morning programme was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull derailed Tony Abbott.
Rival programme Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The ballast of distance didn't seem to bother Australian TV viewers, with the average Sunrise viewership in the five state capitals at 397,000, compared to Today's figure of 339,000.
Today's average rose slightly compared with Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise over the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far through September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers, compared with 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The changes are blowing this morning not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thanks for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news on Seven was the astonishing first performance of the 800 Words series, which features former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama series, which attracted a quite impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson will be the driving force behind the popular show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this a real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) as well as TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a dual fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) soared to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers for the first half-hour, with a whopping 720,000 for the second half-hour.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia's second night's viewership average brings confidence to Nine that Hot Seat, after all, will eventually become the most popular show at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce viewership of McGuire's show.

Finals trio agree dads say Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he pick?
The secret has been revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who will win The Bachelor.
That woman's identity has been kept extremely secret, which Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls certainly don't quibble about who got the last rose.
However, when talking to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they may have inadvertently tipped off the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed ahead of Thursday's final
All three women cast themselves as poetic in telling how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humour, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?" their answers may have offered a revelation as to who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated from day one.
"From the moment I walked in the house, (Sarah's) energies and Sam's energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be around her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited to pairing up.
Mackay said last week's house-visiting meetings made him realise Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family I realised that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," she said.
Asked who Wood should pick if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose to join the San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this appears to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after the way this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball on his first fly-kick return during the team's 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his man and allowed Hayne to return the next fly kick as well as involving him in the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula's true nature was also evident in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits spades in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne during the post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reports Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flyout that was intercepted by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
This certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his numerous Australian fans were hoping for for on the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way out after being dropped from the field, and later told Australian radio pairing Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at frequency 104.1 that he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things now, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne likened his fumbling to his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own end zone led to a Queensland goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for a photo posted on his Instagram account with fans while holding an Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airstrip.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized and his efforts to support democracy curtailed.
4 killed as police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the country's new draft constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence took place Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandu.
The top official in the area, Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air, before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will weaken their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group claims a state of its own.
At least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes since August 10, including 11 police officers.
At the time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after April's devastating earthquake killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have this week voted on clauses in the draft constitution in Katmandu, and officials have said a new charter could probably be approved by Sunday.
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) says there is a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde.
A wide front of low pressure, located about 560km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde island group, has a 60 per cent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde group of islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast center added.
Google Launches Donation Campaign Aiming to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) released a donation campaign that aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help the thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an extraordinarily personal perspective when it posted the donation campaign on its blog.
Indeed, instead of an executive making the announcement, it was Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, who wrote about her own personal experience.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match with the same amount for every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, so that the total target is $11 million.
Europe is experiencing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, driven mainly by Syria's four-year civil war that has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Slimming surgery may help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to tell whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are treated in ways other than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," Dr. Robin Blackstone notes. She is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the individuals in the study have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
A BMI, or weight to height ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is more than 30, the person is considered obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass as well as gastric reduction, with medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of those cut fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of individuals treated with means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Thirty-six percent of the individuals who underwent surgery had a complete cure for diabetes and 28 percent had a partial cure.
In comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely cured in just 1 percent and partially cured in about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as the "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored the patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c levels should remain below 7 percent, the researchers wrote.
Postoperative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
However, this better "glycemic control," described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, says principal investigator Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the group that underwent gastric reduction surgery, the group that underwent gastric bypass had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered their body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), lowered their hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent, respectively).
Blackstone, of the University of Arizona's College of Medicine-Phoenix, says that while the study shows no survival or surgery after five years, there are study results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who underwent weight loss surgery were 29 per cent less likely to die over a 15-year period when compared to a group who had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study shows no improvement in survival among surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are nonetheless encouraging for individuals with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The study results are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group" and is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the point when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it will be very tricky to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he delivered at the opening of the Oxford-based Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion at the start of his ten-day visit to Britain. The centre is dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all humanity should be put ahead of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the actions of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It's wonderful to look after several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused a chain of violent events.
"After 9/11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
In the past four years, children's ingestion of hand disinfectant has increased fourfold
Poison data centers across the U.S. have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in ingestion of the heavily alcoholic hand disinfectant for children under 12, since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Information Center, cases of disinfectant ingestion reported to poison information centers in children under 12 rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Kids are getting interested in these products more often and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are going to be on call," Lopez told CNN.
She said some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or rise to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get a cheap up-and-coming binge.
According to reports, the teens have mixed disinfectant with an alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant scents of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are ones with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer can contain alcohol of anything between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially in young children, only a few squirts are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the Poison Information Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand sanitizer is left in plain sight, and if kids take an interest in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed just four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood-alcohol level was .179, which is twice the adult drink-drive limit, according to Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed as she spoke and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey reported.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes, as well as moving disinfectant out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials hypothesize that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been reported as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "nasty" teacher by spreading a bacterial toxin in a classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
Police consider the foiled plan "idle babble" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumour Mill: No contradictions at Celtic
Griffiths disparages talk of Celtic conflicts, and Deila admits Hoops are in a tight spot but he makes it turn
Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's charges, and Warburton is wary of January recruitments that could disrupt team unity
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths plays down talk of contradictions
There have been rumours of conflicts within Celtic, but Griffiths immediately bypassed them. He insists he and his team-mates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team is gearing up to face the Dutch series leader.
I think we are not under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to the encounter.
Lack of Scots championship race bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and ex-Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the title with Rangers.
Mr de Boer, the current Ajax ambassador, said: "The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer being shown in Holland and why?"
Because Rangers aren't in it.
People here can't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They talk about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and non-Scottish people want to watch those games as well.
Deila vows to turn situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic are in trouble but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
Defeat to Malmo and resulting drip from the Champions League was quickly followed by defeat by Aberdeen, who are now top of the league with five points going into the next.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods in the past, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as we possibly can.
I know that this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We certainly need the supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
The important thing now is to stick together.
Warburton wary of January player transfers
Despite commenting just a few weeks ago on possible targets for January player transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of a recruitment frenzy, assuring that he does not want to mix consensus with the squad.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different compared to the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, there is a period of adjustment throughout the pre-season, which is reflected in our squad this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name has been linked with a move to Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted he may retire after his contract with the Swans runs out.
The 29-year-old has had ankle problems for two years and failed to find a new club outside Wales over the summer.
Hearts are on standby to fight the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was the third red card in the last eight months to be overturned by Collum.
Neilson stands by what he said, claiming: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburg, ahead of the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment," the striker said, adding: "I guess it's safe to say I won't be going back to Tynecastle unless I then move on to play for Celtic."
Tannadice board believe in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists the Dundee United board still have faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits player deterioration must end.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys fit again," says Donnelly.
McInnes delighted with 'ugly win' in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits his team, Aberdeen, hung in desperately for the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to clinch their seventh successive league win thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty that put them top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says: "There isn't a single team that has won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league, that hasn't also won games in this way."
Scottish unemployment stays the same as UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, coinciding with unemployment across the UK rising by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent is higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) say.
Meanwhile, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people in the three-month period, with the number of people in work now standing at 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on these latest figures, David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, said: "The government's long-term plan is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
Over these 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention of any kind, later today I will watch the man being executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the gallery of spectators at Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I am beginning to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the full story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than vacancies, participants are chosen through a dire draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to one of Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One Oklahoman journalist took to Twitter to accuse me of compromising my impartiality.
There's a lesson here.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that he "could have put his words together better" but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of what I've said and written.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t do it if he did.
I have told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants there to be an international journalist there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will help the anti-death penalty trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more, you can listen to my podcasts.
I will not go over all the details again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of accessory anyway.
But I believe there is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe executing him is wrong.
And so that's the perspective from which I'm watching him die.
I can't claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists there to see to it.
I'll give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured away from Canning River after watery police hunt
The Canning Vale constable remained dry as he lured the man away from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract officers from their heels went awry when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres from a police officer trying to "gentlely lure him back to the beach."
Canning Vale Police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading into the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying 'I'm not coming away, come and get me,'" Senior Sgt. Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "decent police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," Senior Sergeant Castledine told me.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown over and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He was unsuccessful in his attempt but inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims journalists tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has alleged that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate their spies into his stables last year, and is threatening to stop racing immediately.
He blames the trustees and Racing Victoria's Integrity Section, claiming they have a personal campaign under way against him. Wednesday's late rejection of Lady Tatai over a treatment procedure on race day was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what is best for the competition and that he has found himself in a tricky situation following Lidar's inexplicably positive sample of cobalt.
He has kept his tongue in check over spying allegations for a year and a half, and didn't want "it to look like envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've long been silent on the issue, but sometimes you get so frustrated that everything unravels at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was continuing.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start thinking differently, that's when I don't have to continue to be a coach.
Then I would have to consider what I do with my licence.
Earlier, Moody tipped the bombshell in an interview with racing.com, saying that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I name him when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he would pass on information about what I do there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, of course they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to get me.
Robert Roulston, the former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current chairman of Racing Victoria, as well as Bernard Saundry, the current chief executive of Racing Victoria, were all clear on that at the time and are clear on that today.
Should I start thinking this is about to get personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps shift responsibility to more than just the trainers for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they need to take away my licence and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will possibly make them think just that.
But I'm at the point now where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I'm pushing them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-term Lidar cobalt investigation, and the late rejection prompted him to state that he could "throw his licence over the table."
Moody, best known for training undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule on race-day grooming procedures "ridiculous" after a mud or clay bath was put at a horse's feet, which is illegal.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It had that on race day.
Moody could face a three-month ban because of the race-day brood treatment, from which the trustees began an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver guilty of road escape in Cobram arrested
POLICE have arrested a man who committed a road escape after a collision with a cyclist at the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital after sustaining serious injuries when he was struck by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia self-reported to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised claims by two NRL rugby league champion favourites that his team's tackles were part of an "alignment."
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed the Storm to "wrestle" with its own side when it unexpectedly won a finals qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely disguise his reference to the Storm after it beat the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in a finals qualifier. Bennett called the game a "sample window" for rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not "immensely enthusiastic" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they are just focusing on "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by criticism of the Storm from the two leading coaches, as it means they fear losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling at the time we lost to them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee you we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year. In the last six weeks we've just stressed contact in tackles, and that's what's made us successful.
Trent has been in the team for three years, and obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and so this was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the Bennett-coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the title in 2010 by playing "boring."
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play the kind of rugby we think is exciting, especially when he's got fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have that type of player.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
I become more confident when they say things like this because they are a bit worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us as resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between the Storm and Roosters was more spot-on than the one between the Broncos and Cowboys.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18 so we had two more goals but is that exciting rugby?
Or does that make it exciting to break the defensive line and not score?
For me, this is about lines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
The Storm have this weekend off because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man faces $200,000 bail on drug charge
A MAN facing a possible life sentence for attempting to possess 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bond.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 pounds of the drug to the Solay yacht, which entered South America via Vanuatu and docked in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was seen meeting the other defendants at the marina throughout the morning, then meeting them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 pounds of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovic faces a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a quantity of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer argued that there is no evidence that Maksimovic attempted to possess the entire quantity, and that he may have been in the cafe for entirely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was trying to escape.
"He has close links with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to police about the place where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 bond to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting bail at $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone was not enough to stop him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on condition he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to police daily and maintains his 6pm to 6am curfew.
Stevan Hogg used girl's phone to entice paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she slept and then logged on to an online communication service, where Hogg received numerous indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up to find the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found the shocking messages, then immediately told her mother.
Upon entering, police saw five images, searched computers at the scene and found "worrying" online searches with search terms that had been used to look for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he had done this to "groom paedophiles" on the internet, before he would "pretend to be a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court the following: "He said it was an addiction - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had carried out the searches on a computer but said that they had only been carried out because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer so he could startle paedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for baiting purposes.
He said he is sick in the head after drinking, and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Mr Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone she was screaming for her mother, shaking and crying.
The mother saw the indecent images on the phone and then confronted the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and said that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of making or taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year. He breached his bail conditions on January 25 this year and failed to appear at a court hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence barrister Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders register as it can be argued that there was "no significant sexual element" to his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal adjourned sentencing until October so social services have time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody ahead of the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders register ahead of sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes wrong speech to parliament
Mugabe, Africa's most senior leader, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but a video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and interrupted him with interjections as he delivered a state of the country address to parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, group discipline enforcer for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the message is titled 'death,'" Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned relevant members that immunity would end in parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The group discipline watchdog said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is braced to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and expense-cutting efforts in its business services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two exchange-traded companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in expenses starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring actions will allow for a more competitive and sustainable expense structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," stated Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive officer, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than modern-day HP, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help businesses transition to a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and will "focus on delivering unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to businesses, according to a company statement.
The split breaks up the company, which was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical goods. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto called the "origin of Silicon Valley."
HP has been undergoing a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer maker and one of the largest technology firms in the U.S., and its demerger is the latest in an industry based on the belief that tightly circumscribed firms perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates must back injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is now only September and, assuming his rehabilitation goes as planned, there is no reason why he should not be back playing by Christmas.
Even in this best-case scenario, Wilshire will miss at least the next four England games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will take part in next summer's European Championship.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere's end to last season was strong after an individual ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"Such an injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It's nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view but, as Wenger also admitted, there is always a risk of further injury when a player attempts to return mid-season.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in formation.
Investigations by Premier Injuries Ltd show Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since debuting six years ago.
In addition, over the past five seasons he has played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider total since 2007-08, in six of the eight seasons it has been the second of those Premier League teams to miss the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe their improvement on injury statistics last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you bounce back from an injury you can have a prone period where you have to strengthen your body and acquire competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to rotate his squad when Arsenal begin their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then play Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the starting line-up.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in for Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear forward favourites for Group F, Maksimir's stadium in Zagreb is among the most formidable in Europe.
Dinamo have also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned the lessons from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream of leading a team to its first European Cup triumph.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It's eye-popping how similar portrayals don't exist in shows, particularly given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate among young men higher than it has been in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year for men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 students in secondary school and high school showed depressive symptoms. According to the study, a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of their friends were in "healthy spirits."
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of developing possible mental health problems was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But for a friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this time of communicating via social media, style goes by content and the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled down on the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, when in reality isolation rules.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this comes at the expense of internal values - inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer explained recently, money really doesn't get you any greater happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but rather by their personalities, which clearly stood out in their interactions as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, their moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humour came from the knowledge that, yes, men can relate to all this, even if they are often hesitant to fully explore their feelings.
As a Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ..." listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I've really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often men who contact us feel they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you'll be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between the two men.
While my unbiased, outsider status on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the filming locations have been redesigned to celebrate, why not take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends is broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, take part in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani scoring goals against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line as Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut, pointing the way for the French league champions, but the team wasted several chances before finally adding to their advantage as Cavani struck with a goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in the same Group A as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion as there was not only a further place to play, but also an improvement in their quarter-final-leading games in the final three rounds
But while PSG took the points, it was no classic game, with Laurent Blanc's team's Zlatan Ibrahimovic losing a place in front of goal and later being substituted from the field. Malmo are his old hometown team and the team he started his brilliant career with in 1999.
"In the Champions League, it's not easy to win at home or away, so a 2-0 win spells trouble for the opponent and looks good in the stats, and is a good start, although there are things we'll have to hone in on this season," Blanc said.
This bodes well.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret we didn't manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team from injury in one of three changes made after the team missed a 2-2 draw in a Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux at the weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian winger was named as the man to take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland into the back corner of the net.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It beat Celtic in the deciding game to reach this level, its opening field featuring nine international players and a five-man defence, as well as two players deep in midfield.
But the team offered little on the offensive side other than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute that went nip past Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
Instead, PSG found themselves in a quandary at times because of missed passes and poor finishing from Ibrahimovic in particular, who failed to score five tries in all in the first half alone and was then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch right at the start of the second half.
But he was far more effective in doing some pre-work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent a twisting kick on its way that tipped around Wiland's goalpost on the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour into the game thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who struck his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had scuffed forward Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmo's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's superb save from David Luiz's direct kick kept the closing numbers down, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal was disallowed at the very end of the game.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were one level above his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game from them.
Glencore to raise $2.5bn through share sale
Glencore, the Swiss-based mining giant hit by the commodity price crash, raised $2.5bn on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its sweeping debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a service note that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6bn to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with plummeting commodity prices as China's economic slowdown strains demand and wreaks havoc across all markets.
The new entry put the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had unveiled a $2.5bn share sale the previous week as part of its wider plan to cut its $30bn debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital at 125 pence a share, which meant a 2.4 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth a total of 9.99 percent of the group.
Worries about a long-running standstill in Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and will be in response to President Barack Obama's recent November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
The US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for Xi and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders hold bilateral talks.
"Prient Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on numerous global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, and at the same time will allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively discuss issues where there are differences," the statement added.
In the visit, which was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to make an outlier in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with numerous U.S. technology leaders, before continuing toward New York City and the U.N. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a host of contentious topics, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absolutism in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays differences in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On Sunday night's episode of Project Greenlight, Brown was interrupted by an experienced actor who emphasized the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a film, not a series," Damon argued.
A shocked Brown reacted with aggrieved disbelief, commenting "Oops! Wow. Okay," while The Martian actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to urge people to think, whoever the director is, about how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the start.
The only dark character is a hooker who is punched by his white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People claimed the rights to direct the film for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded harshly that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation aired, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing: "Matt Damon talking over the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE it hurts."
The tweet garnered more than 5000 retweets and 4000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discourse.
Following the 2014 killing of teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer, The Black Lives Matter movement sprawled nationwide and called on lawmakers and authorities to end practices that discriminate against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referenced the movement when introducing the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement to answer a question from Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the executives said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or already met with the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional rock climber and crockery collector Isaac Caldiero on Monday became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and was rewarded with a $1 million grand prize.
Just finishing its seventh season, the competition program has never had a contestant survive all sections of the program's obstacle course.
In the show's final episode, two men, Caldiero as well as cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
On the last mission, you had to climb a rope of about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge on time, making him the first athlete ever to clear the grueling 4th leg of American Ninja Warrior. But Caldiero cleared the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after the tricky win and was still in shock about winning the $1 million grand prize.
"So it's awesome to think about this, having never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big pay raise.
So all of a sudden...I can't even imagine what this is going to be...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten isn’t getting more reward money, despite being the first contestant ever to break through.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money will go to whoever has the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes lives, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He's just so happy that he's been able to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a decent family man.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, 'If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy that it was Isaac.'
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if this had gone the other way.
"American Ninja Warrior" will return for season eight, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their spoiler role perfectly Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to get within a game-half of the Houston Astros in the race for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, for one night at least, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word that had been very elusive for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how you get them," said Tigers team president Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit scored a run three times in the first two innings, followed by once in the sixth and once more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong finish to this year," Simon said.
It's tricky to pitch to a changeup every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, his first strikeouts since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hitter of the night since he hit four against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in batting practice and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the latter half of the seventh inning, and it was their best chance to get back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by striking out twice to the left field line.
Right-hander Aaron Hicks homered on a one-base snap, and Simon got burned right by second baseman Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player facing him, ahead of rookie substitute Miguel Sano, who yanked a two-base run to left from right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on base and a smoothing runner at second base, VerHagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to hit a groundout leading off the double play.
It was a major league record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit got a safety run in the bottom of the ninth, Mauer yanked a two-hitter against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, and it was 5-4.
But the right-handed player burned Sano on three pitches in his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a rusty Phil Hughes at the start.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a veteran right-handed player who got off the injured list before the game after being off for more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious that I didn't want a start like this," Hughes said, "but as the game went on, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was able to make some nice pitches in the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starting hitter at first base, he allowed second baseman Ian Kinsler to advance one to mid-on.
Right fielder J.D. Martinez's walk in a two-fire situation brought in batting Victor Martinez, who took himself to first base on a midfield hit and caused the game's first run.
Victor Martinez snapped his 0-21 streak with runners in good running positions.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos kept hitting to his right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was ejected while trying to advance to third base.
The Tigers went ahead in the second inning and got one fire, in a two-base situation, a run from catcher James McCann and two fire, in a one-base situation, a run from center Anthony Gose, then made it 3-0.
"It was an important snap," Twins team president Paul Molitor said.
He didn't bat very well, but it flew to the right point.
Hughes began to pitch and pitched a runless third inning, then was replaced by right-handed forward A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs on six strikeouts, along with a walk on four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was carted off because of a sprain in the shoulder of his throwing hand. ...
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, but was supposed to return Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's tally for the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts since left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a strained right oblique abdominal muscle.
The three-game series between the Tigers and Twins concludes Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) will line up against Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges wider opening of economy to world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group Tuesday tasked with steering reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and develop a transparency policy," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the push for deeper universal reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as pushing ahead with reforms will add new movement and vitality, as well as create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The executive approved a series of guidelines including a negative list restricting market access, loosening border control principles, urging state-owned enterprises to seize private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be created to name the sectors and companies that are not allowed to invest.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is notable for giving the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a law-based corporate environment and making markets more transparent, the statement said.
The government is also loosening its control over the power it hands out to businesses, thereby ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their businesses.
The statement also said China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
More sectors are opening up to private financiers to open up government-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy regarding foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies as well as providing them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, known as "green cards", is facilitated by optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and support for professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, it said in a statement released after the meeting.
