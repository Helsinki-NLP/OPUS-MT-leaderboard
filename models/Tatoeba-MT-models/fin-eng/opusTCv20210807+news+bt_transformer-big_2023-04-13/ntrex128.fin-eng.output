Welsh assembly members fear they look like fools
Some members of the assembly have been confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP, or Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The uproar was sparked by a plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Regardless of party affiliation, members of the Assembly are concerned that the change could put them in for ridicule.
According to one Labour spokesman, the group is concerned that the name "rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poo.
One Plaid spokesman said the majority of the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a Conservative Party spokesman, his group is "open minded" about the name change, but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the word MWP to the word for fool.
In Welsh, the letter "w" is pronounced in this context similar to the "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Representative Commission, which is currently working on the legislative change needed for the name change, said as follows: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council belongs, of course, to the members themselves."
The Wales Governance Act 2017 gives the assembly the power to change its name.
The commission published an opinion poll on the proposals in June, showing broad support for nominating the assembly for the Welsh parliament.
The commission favoured Welsh MPs or the acronym WMP as the title for assembly members, but the MWP option received the most support in public opinion polling.
It is understood that members of the assembly are proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus could cause headaches for chairwoman Elin Jones, who is expected to have a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on the amendments contains other changes concerning the functioning of the Representative Council, such as the rules on the loss of the office and the form of the committee system.
In legislative proceedings, the members of the Representative Council may give their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum is aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the northern neighbor's name is tantamount to a territorial claim on its rightful territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership aspirations.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
But backers of a referendum like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the name change is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins bells go silent as Harlem churches live through tough times
"The elderly people I've talked to say that there used to be a bar or a church on every street corner," says Adams.
"Nowadays, there's neither."
He said the loss of bars is understandable.
He said, "The way people interact has changed."
"Bars are no longer the communal living rooms of the neighbourhood where people gather regularly."
When it comes to churches, he worries that asset sales won't carry as far as executives imagine, "and sooner or later they're back to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced with residences and apartments that are not occupied by people who would support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"Absolutely more people who buy apartments in these buildings are going to be white," he says, "and thus they will hasten the day when these churches close their doors for good, because it's unlikely that most of the people moving into these apartments would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby congregation of blacks acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by a congregation of Black people under the direction of the Rev. John Howard Johnson. He led a boycott against shopkeepers on 125th Street, a central commercial street in Harlem, after they objected to the hiring or promotion of Black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building. When Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
The Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "the poor man's clocks."
An expert who played the tower clock game in July called it by another name: "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the world's first tower clock game played by a Black musician. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins did not replace him.
A complex skein has developed at St. Martins in recent months, involving some of the church's lay leaders on the one hand and architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal Diocese on the other.
The sacristy - the governing body made up of the parish's lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "seek to roll over the costs" to the sacristy, even though the sacristy had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while the boy was diving for lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack happened at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV he was diving with friends Saturday morning for about a half-hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled over to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was just excited after catching the lobster, but then realized he was screaming, "I got bit!"
I was bitten!'
Once he got to the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire collarbone had been ripped open.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, from where his condition is reportedly critical.
The species of the shark that attacked is unknown.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media event that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier but was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for UK beauty sector
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments where expert advisers serve.
This is a significant move for the UK's £2.8bn-worth beauty sector, which continues to grow even as sales of fashion and home goods weaken. Larger beauty divisions are being trialled in 11 stores across the country, and if successful will be expanded to other stores next year.
There will be investment in beauty products as supermarkets look to fill shelf space previously reserved for TVs, microwave ovens and home goods.
Sainsbury's says its range of beauty products is doubling to 3,000 products, which for the first time includes brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space, and they will have their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up range. Going forward, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain is trialling rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift of groceries to small one-time purchases in convenience stores is forcing supermarkets to come up with new inducements for customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against low-cost stores such as Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food items.
Since buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, plus Habitat stores. The firm says this has promoted food sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy divisions.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended in a row over how the proceeds from pharmacies in supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy follows an acquisition that saw Sainsbury's sell its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m three years ago.
The firm said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand to four stores the range of luxury skincare products with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said as follows: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise clients.
Our range of brands caters to all needs and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us a compelling beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "furious" as TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of £11m deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their homewares and accessories brand Truly.
The duo's company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle business in the final moments. She now plans to focus on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" at last Tuesday's tense emotional meeting, which took place at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5million as a deal would not leave enough time for their homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The firm has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was bet to double Willoughby's estimated £11m fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: "Truly was clearly Holly's most important venture.
It was his long-term plan that was supposed to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone stunned.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to publication.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
The This Morning presenter is one of Britain's most secure-yielding stars, and her departure could result in a multimillion-dollar loss for the company, according to experts, due to product investments that include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to homeware, not to mention delaying the release.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife of three years, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby organised Capp for Truly in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones took over as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being baked into M&S's new brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "we don't comment on his business."
Tight talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as his positivity toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, faking the sound of a "news anchor."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out Kim's interest in meeting again after Trump hailed the first July meeting as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
But the nuclear talks have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees "no corresponding reaction" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the U.S. would continue with its sanctions, designed to keep up the pressure.
Trump had a far more optimistic outlook in his speech.
"We are doing excellently with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results. Missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get into this crowded hall outside for 10,000 more, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroy island, hundreds dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told they were not needed.
A national state of emergency for international aid was not declared, although about 10 percent of Lombok's residents had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it very clear they're not asking for international help, so it's a bit of a challenging situation," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is forming a Return-travelling group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia remains woefully unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the regularly frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
Lives were likely lost in Palu due to the missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in effect.
Travelling between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging even in the best of circumstances.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship assigned to help earthquake victims in Lombok is headed for the Return, but it will take at least three days for it to reach a new casualty zone.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure a centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has funneled money into improving roads and railways.
But Joko's administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while new elections are approaching next year.
The pressure on Joko is also compounded by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the country's Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of the religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons. This has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and forced tens of thousands from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sinks late leveller against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after painting on 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 27 away from Chelsea's goal after his team had a goal in a losing position.
He moved the ball to his left before scooping a shot toward the back post.
The shot floated high over the penalty area towards the top right corner.
Eventually, the ball landed over a throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much up the pitch as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, took one touch and fired without too much thought".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgium's Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
On the occasion, the Blues tip gave a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic, before spinning away near midfield and spurting Liverpool into the field half.
Kovacic played a quick wall pass in center field.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a superb through pass.
Hazard ran away from the defence and outpaced Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a left-footed shot into the back corner.
Liverpool face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832 dead
Early Sunday, Indonesia's disaster agency said the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832 victims.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo told a press conference that many had been trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings when the 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and whipped up waves up to six metres high.
Fragments of collapsed buildings spread widely across Palu, a city of 380,000 people.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning sparked a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55am on Grayson Mews in John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people who were in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Chief Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact police if they have seen or heard anything.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video to contact the police. They may have information vital to the investigation".
A female police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may know the woman have come to the scene of the crime asking about where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are working to inform the victim's loved ones of what happened.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just been trying to get back to his flat but had been told by police that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents have just learned it could be hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
Repeatedly, he said, "It's terrible."
At two in the afternoon, there were two Maijas in the cordoned-off area, and a third outside.
Several police officers were in the cordoned-off area, monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using passcode 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue too caught up in history rewrite scramble
Indeed, evicting the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious memorabilia like the best of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "foolish" and a "rewrite of history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues would make a target of the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither commanded nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell embodies 19th-century opinions and is historical evidence of a figure many still consider worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, regard Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was brought about by the monarchy in this case.
Whether or not this is an accurate description is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain, at least, is that the controversy of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation. Cromwell, for his part, is a recognizable figure who represents another side of that divide.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance".
Killer Pig Smashes Chinese Farmer to Death
Local media reports that a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
The body of a man identified only by his surname "Yuan" was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province. The man's artery had been severed and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig herder prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunna province on Wednesday in a bid to sell 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed the door to a nearby pig farm was open.
In the pig, he said, he saw a big boar with its mouth covered in blood.
According to the news release, a forensic examination confirmed the 250-pound boar crushed the farmer to death.
The Guiyang Evening News reports a cousin named "Wu" as saying "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
CCTV footage shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs at 4.40am on Thursday morning.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market's managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so as not to harm others while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans before, although that is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the US state of Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to shoo the animal away.
An Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News channel that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
'They're just playful.
They're like little kids, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them appropriately," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa will weaken as predicted as it moves over cooler waters off Mexico's northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flash flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 38 meters per second, a Category One hurricane, on Sunday at 5 a.m. East Coast time, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Low pressure is meanwhile building over the Pacific Ocean, heading east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa enters the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture north toward the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture, then interacting with approaching low pressure, will form large areas of rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall amounts of 25 to 100 millimetres will cause dangerous heavy rain flooding and possibly landslides in the desert mass.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall totals of 50 to 75 millimeters per hour in certain depositions, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 50 to 100 millimeters of rain is expected for certain areas in the southwest and Arizona in particular.
Heavy rain flooding is possible and conditions could deteriorate rapidly due to patchy tropical rain.
In the face of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid heading into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into torrential rivers and thunderstorms produce localized wind gusts and flying dust.
An approaching area of low pressure will bring localized heavy rain to coastal areas of Southern California.
More than 10 millimetre rainfall is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday until the rains extend through Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last throughout Wednesday.
In October, the U.S. may see strong swings in temperatures throughout as the Arctic cools but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature swings over short distances.
The central United States will see a prime example of large temperature differences on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The lingering heat of summer tends to intensify and expand again in the coming days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures around +26 degrees in the southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
In New York City, temperatures could climb to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, there is a good chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million watched Tuesday's broadcast, carried by six television networks, of the fascinating testimony of Supreme Court Justice-designate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of a sex crime in the 1980s.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as broadcasters suspended their broadcasts with a last-minute twist that the FBI will conduct a weeklong investigation into the allegations based on a deal arranged by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh, who was intoxicated, groped him and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave an emotional testimony saying he was 100 percent sure this did not happen.
There were likely more viewers than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company averaged viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels that broadcast the occasion, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble measuring viewers who are watching in offices.
Something about the proportions says that the reading is equivalent to the number of people watching an American football playoff game or the Oscars.
Among all broadcasters, the highest viewership was on Fox News Channel, according to Nielsen, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination. The channel averaged 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the center of Friday's drama was Flake.
Cameras on CNN and CBS captured how he was escorted into an elevator by the screams of protesters on his way to a Judiciary Committee hearing Friday. The moderate Republican's backup had previously indicated he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed live how he stood with minute-by-minute glances down as the reproaches flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he will tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," she was told.
Flake said his office issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
Hours later, the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live as the Judiciary Committee began voting to take Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the Senate plenary session.
But Flake said he was acting only on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was convinced, in part, by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after speaking with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of politicking Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her EU exit plans of politicking that threatens Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Next to her interview with May, the newspaper's front page published another interview in which her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, continued to attack May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls the suggestion that Britain and the EU would levy each other's import duties "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person of interest in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who was playing basketball at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to jail. The Baton Rouge Police Department says he is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of the showdown between Sims and Simpson in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during questioning.
His bail was set at US$350,000, according to Advocate magazine.
The East Baton Rouge municipal medical examiner released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency commends the Louisiana State Police task force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University police and area residents for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's physical education director, thanked law enforcement for their "nobility and delivery of justice."
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-4 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds a game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "appalled" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
Ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico's disaster prevention center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions were registered in the space of 24 hours.
The center registered pounding and shaking several times.
Photos were posted on social media showing a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, located 72 kilometers southwest of the capital, after Mexico was shaken by a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
Known as "Don Goyo," the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash between pro-independence demonstrators and riot police. Thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the resignation vote that divided opinion.
Police held back a group of masked independence supporters who pelted police with eggs and powder paint that formed dark clouds of dust on streets normally filled with tourists.
More skirmishes broke out as the day went on as police officers used their batons to contain the melees.
Clashes between pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former chanting "no forgetting, no forgiveness," and the latter "long live Spain."
The local press reports fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tension is still running high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal but which Catalan separatists are celebrating.
Voters chose independence with a clear majority, although participation was low as those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
Catalan officials say nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes as police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups spent the night outdoors on Friday to prevent a rally in support of the national police.
There was a demonstration, but it had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist rally with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck in our seats," she says.
Despite a narrow but vital victory in last December's regional elections, the momentum for pro-Catalan independence parties has waned this year. Many of the best-known leaders are in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides have stoked the controversy.
"The situation is tightening all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in pre-trial detention since last year, announced he would take part in next year's European parliamentary elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion of democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
Events went ahead at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm UK time.
Detective Chief Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and building were damaged.
At some point, the car was shot with a crossbow.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 on Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Series-raiser Livingston stunned Rangers and inflicted only a second defeat on Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough for victory as Gary Holt's team climbed into a shared second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed out on a first away win of the season in the Premiership. It next faces series leader Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points ahead.
Rangers still face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten streak in the series to six games already. Head coach Holt has yet to lose once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lose places against visitor with lack of blade
Holt's team should have been leading long before his goal after causing Rangers serious trouble with their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through but the finishing touch went wide. Next Alan Lithgow was able to slide in a goal-advantage pass from Craig Halkett but steered the ball past him.
The hosts favourably ceded ball control to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
The important goal came that way.
Rangers inflicted a free-kick on Livingston, from where Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball into the middle of the penalty area and finish.
By then Rangers had held the ball but found the home team's defence holding, with little chance of a try for goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a save.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's effort and Lithgow steered the ball past yet another Livingston special occasion.
Concentrations that rained down in the Livingston penalty area were constantly tidied away. There was also a needless call for a penalty on two occasions - after Halkett tackled substitute Glenn Middleton and from a ball hit in the hand.
"Gorgeous performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and were excellent down to each player, going on to have an up-and-coming season.
The way the team has played and the crew has hardly changed since it got back to the highest level.Holt, however, needs to be credited for the way he has solidified the team since arriving.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was spectacular in leading a superbly organised defence, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
True, Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has performed really well at times under Gerrard but now fell far short of his standards.
The final pass was left exhausted, and they only managed to open up the home team's defence once. This should serve as a wake-up call for Rangers, who are mid-table in the standings.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky was blue on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the final day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing relations between the NATO allies.
There have been disagreements over human rights and press freedom as well as Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan went on to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police prevented the 25,000-strong crowd of supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the issue on security grounds, but many supporters still gathered nearby to watch the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also brought their voices to the floor, denouncing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Rival demonstrations reflect a split in opinion. Some German Turks hail him as a hero while others revil him as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed when he collided with a car in London.
The accident happened at around 10am local time in the south-west of Deptford, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed in a road escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's crash.
City police say they are working to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
Road closures are in place and bus services have been diverted. Motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin jail: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials say six prison guards were injured in the unrest at the men's high-security prison.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 09:30 on Sunday UK time and is still continuing.
Tornado special police have been brought in to calm the unrest, which is backed by eight inmates in one prison wing.
Minor facial injuries to police officers were treated at the scene.
A Prison Service spokeswoman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent to HMP Long Lartin prison to look after the situation.
Six members of staff have been treated for their injuries.
We do not condone violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have received hospital treatment in June after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In addition, riot police were alerted to the prison in October for serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings threat of heavy rain flooding to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (drought areas may benefit)
Tropical lows rarely arrive in Arizona, but that's exactly what's about to happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern desert, bringing with it the risk of heavy rain flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning for heavy rain flooding through Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast Caifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday. It will arrive Monday in the form of rains.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix noted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 40 miles (65 km) from the Arizona border".
The National Hurricane Center's latest modeling predicts 50 to 100 millimeters of rain. The Mogollin ridge in Arizona could see up to 150 millimeters of rain in some places.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get between 25 and 50 millilitres. A total of up to 100 millimetres of rain could fall in places.
Rosa's rains can also be a blessing in a drought-affected area, provided there is no risk of heavy rain flooding.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some rainfall may be beneficial as the south-southwest has been hit by severe drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Bureau, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico on its route.
As of Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. It is still hurricane-strength at that time with wind speeds of 135 kilometers per hour. It is moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses strength as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm strength during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and pose a substantial flood risk.
"From the California Peninsula to northwest Sonora, 75 to 150 millimeters are expected, with up to 250 millimeters possible," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey across Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical low in the early morning hours of Tuesday. From there, it will continue its journey across Arizona to southern Utah by late evening on Tuesday..
"The main risks for Rosa or its remnants are likely to be associated with extremely heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain flooding and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4am UK time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is reported to be in a "stable" condition.
During the night, police say they have arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset.
Police are appealing for anyone who may have video footage of the incidents recorded on a mobile phone to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh experienced "nasty and angry" in Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered "meanness and anger" from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, He forcefully and emotionally denied a charge of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford that would have occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified about his accusation at the hearing.
The president said Saturday "the American people saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"A vote in favor of confirming Judge Kavanaugh's nomination is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with outstanding track records for public service," he told his crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an implicit reference to Kavanaugh's appointment when talking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the fullest," he said.
"That's why I go around all over the place to fight for outstanding candidates."
Trump claimed Democrats took it upon themselves to "resist and obstruct."
A senior Republican Party leadership aide told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's nomination procedure is expected in the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said Saturday at least 384 died after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Many were wiped out by the giant waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the banks of Palu town on Friday when waves up to six metres high hit the shore at dusk. Many washed to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately flee, leaving them its victims," said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's major disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone. It pulled cars, tree trunks, houses and struck everywhere on land," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached speeds of 800 kilometres per hour in the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area that is home to 2.4 million people.
BPPT, Indonesia's agency for assessing and applying technology, issued a statement saying the energy released in Friday's huge earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says the terrain of the town, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have swelled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the devastation as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims had been found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 personnel had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and that the damage may be higher from Palu 300 kilometers north on the continuous coast, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's center.
Communications "are completely down and there has been no information from Donggala" says Nugroho.
A statement issued by the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had struck the Return. Officials, though, said the waves arrived while the warning was being issued.
Amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the upper floors of the building frantically shouting warnings of an impending tsunami at people on the street.
Just minutes later, a wall of water hits the beach, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the image material, either.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that cut communications around Palu. This made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the military has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities on transport planes, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief efforts, and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff have made it to safety in the town of Palu, where they have been housed in tent fabric canopies in the office courtyard. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, according to Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As aid groups embarked on their inconsolable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling by the Return.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start flowing once the affected area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," says Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can start receiving international aid, but a declaration hasn't been made yet."
As the second night descended on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing held out hope that their loved ones would miraculously depart from the grim tale of natural calamities.
On Saturday, a small boy was lifted from a drain.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's hang-gliding team, had been training the two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, according to Mandagi.
"As a senior member of the hang glider, I have my own emotional baggage," he says.
Gendon says he has been desperately trying to reach Palu contestants who attended the beach festival via WhatsApp messages since news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread among the hang gliding community.
However, only one grey marker turned up after the messages he sent, rather than two blue ones.
"It means, as I understand it, that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 in ATM replenishment in Newport on the Levee
Thieves took $26,750 from an employee at Brink's guarding shop on Friday morning while he was replenishing an ATM at Newport on the Levee. A statement from the Newport Police Department said.
The driver of the car had been emptying and replenishing an ATM located at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy says in a statement.
When the Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "my man ran from behind him" who stole the bag of cash meant for delivery.
The statement said witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their numbers.
People with information about their identities are asked to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "the character that used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been the 41-year-old's West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album titled Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, canceled her participation for "emotional reasons."
West has previously told me that the word also has religious meaning for him in addition to being shorthand for his professional name.
Discussing the album's title earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said he "believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you.""
“I am you, me, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up with the shorter form Ye - which just embodies the goodness, the evil, the confusion in us, just everything.
The album is mostly a reflection on who we are".
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Mr West's previous collaborator JAY-Z has also occasionally deleted and returned the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised he would never use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the reprisals against students.
Appearing in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised he would "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Gunmen fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering monthly student aid and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and a lack of educational opportunities were driving young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Government Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence Research
The United States should double the funding it spends on AI research as China steps up its efforts in the field. So says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by notices on AI from various parts of the U.S. administration, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China already outlined its plan last year: it aims to be a leading developer of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the U.S., and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Doubling the funding could double the likelihood of the next major AI achievement being made in the US, Lee told this week's CNBC interview.
Lee's book, "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order," was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He works as a managing director at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest-ranked Othello player in the U.S. He later held senior positions at Microsoft Research as well as head of Google's China operations.
Lee credited previous technology competitions by the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. investigators have been working hard to get a public grant.
"Academic influencers are not exported by China, but by major corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top university officials in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its AI efforts.
"I think doctoral candidates in artificial intelligence should be automatically issued green cards," he said.
China's State Council on its next-generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way the National Science Foundation and other state organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academic partners. The White House has also announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, on the other hand, invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, a bill to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonians in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians voted in Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia." The name change would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country's aspirations to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the northern neighbour's name to be tantamount to a territorial claim on its rightful territory, and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
The two countries' governments signed an agreement in June on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has indicated he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote is raising doubts about whether turnout will reach the required 50 percent to make the result legitimate.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece'.
Supporters of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, reason that it is worth paying the price to allow Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to aspire to join both the EU and NATO. .
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia to be able to live in freedom as members of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make a decisive difference.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The Central Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 general election, when 66 per cent of eligible voters cast their votes in the end.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership .
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and laying out chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the referendum in front of the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high and not through the kitchen door, said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
“If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, as part of our integration with the euro.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will vote for the name change because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" vote was "to vacate our future."
A poll released Monday by my Macedonian political research institute suggested a turnout of 30 to 43 percent in the referendum - that is, below the required level of activity.
In another poll commissioned by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to succeed, turnout must exceed 50 percent by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats entire Brighton defence with goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made up ground on Brighton's defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal on 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the start of the pattern, the Argentine top-ranked player received a pass from midfield.
He found empty space on the pitch by bursting through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He bulldozed past one defender and then left several others behind on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball down the left.
The English tip used his first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who outpaced Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right corner of the goal.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has a problem with his legs."
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
It did.
We're lucky he scored in that time".
But Sterling had already given the Sky Blues an advantage in the major league struggle.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory in the situation.
He gave a beautiful through pass to Leroy Sane on the left edge.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball onto the back post towards Sterling.
The Sky Blues striker poked the ball into the net just before the end boundary.
City face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a joy-killer in game against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why try to force your way into the starting lineup?
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take over the pitching mound in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have a one-win gap to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Series.
The Rockies picked up at least a wild card with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
"Even though we have no input, at least we can get up the pitch mound knowing that the atmosphere of the crowd and the other team here in Denver creates for me the most demanding competitive setting I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?'
The Nationals have yet to release their starter for Sunday, but are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under the circumstances, according to records.
Scherzer threw a practice session Thursday. He would play in his 34 starts and pitch on his regular rest Sunday.
The Washington right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA stands at 2.53 and he has burned to the batter's base 300 times, with an innings record of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president made an implicit reference to the situation facing his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. He spoke at the same time about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
"All our achievements are in play in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
This is one of the really great ones -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full-throttle, and that's why I go around everywhere to fight for outstanding candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You're seeing this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
They are determined to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't complain about who they're hurting or who they have to bulldoze to get into power. That's what they want, strength and power, but we don't give it to them".
He said Democrats took it upon themselves to "resist and obstruct."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry and mean and malicious and false."
As he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, the audience responded with loud boos.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm waiting a little bit - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen".
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who speak their mind
I wasn't really surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party supported a no-confidence motion against me.
After all, I'm just the latest in a queue of latest Labour figures to be told I'm not welcome - just because we're saying what we think.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way only because of her firm opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
On Friday, Labour in Nottingham East said: "We want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have served as a local Labour representative, the Friday-sized ones on the party council have been just that.
Now not many meetings follow that tone, and the "kinder and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are no longer tolerated in Labour, and that every opinion is judged on whether it suits the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues with whom I had thought I shared a similar political outlook came to expect an about-face and positions from me that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is an avalanche of insults on social media calling for my election to be cancelled, for centrist politics to be abandoned and I get told I shouldn't be in Labour.
And it's not just my own experience.
I certainly know that I am luckier than some of my fellow Members, because the comments directed at me are, after all, political in nature.
I have the utmost respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist slurs on a daily basis and never waver.
The normalization of maltreatment is one of the most disturbing features of the politics of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn insisted Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with each vote of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the party only becomes more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything runs smoothly."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour as a student 32 years ago as a result of the Thatcher government's neglect of the Unified School, as a councillor as well as in ministerial positions, I have sought to promote better public services to those who need them most.
I've never covered my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency can have been surprised by my perspectives or my differences with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, let me say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that will hamper households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with distinction, and the threat of dismissal or the furtherance of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeaten Ayr at blockhead
Two last-minute goals somewhat distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr arguably deserved the win in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr are now top of the table as the only team out of 10 who have not lost a game.
A brilliant defence and more successful risk-taking was, after all, what sustained them, and coach Peter Murchie can be justifiably pleased.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I can be pleased." he says.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, says: "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than us."
Ayr went into the lead on 14 minutes with a Grant Anderson goal and a successful conversion kick by Frazier Climo, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Roy Hughes, who was handed the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to step up, and Jason Baggot to score.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before half-time he scored and managed a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second period well with a Patrick Anderson goal, with a conversion kick that Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased their lead with a Stafford McDowall goal, whose conversion kick was scored by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was yellow-carded, followed by Melrose's Bruce Colvine after heavy pressure to score a conversion kick.
But the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling a no-ball Climo, and Macpherson scored off the back of an Ayr maul from a sideline throw-in.
Climo managed the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's kick and edged Gregor Henry to complete the home team's fifth goal.
'Still Game' star starts in restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named president of a licensed restaurant company and is likely to start working in the hospitality industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he is co-writing with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is listed as a director at the firm Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the information, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": landlocked Bolivia tries to regain link to Pacific Ocean through legal action
Sailors patrol outside a naval base in La Paz.
A blue flag flies on the flagpoles of public buildings.
Navy bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are peppered with the slogan: "Justly, the sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to get it back.'
In landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource war remains strong – as does the yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a strong faith in progress, a spirit of togetherness and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians around the country are watching the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens, hoping that The Hague will endorse Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year, has much at stake in next Monday's alignment.
"A return to the Pacific Ocean is extremely close," he asserted in late August.
True, some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-based UN body does not have the power to extradite Chile's jurisdictions. In addition, the ICJ has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ ruling is issued just six months after the last submissions were made suggests that the case "is not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed rather than furthered Bolivia's purposes.
"The issue of maritime connectivity has been hijacked by the current Bolivian regime," said Zárate.
The rhetoric challenging Morales's feud has stifled the rest of Chileans' goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
Neither country has had the other's embassy since 1962.
The former president and Bolivia's representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never surrender its right to connect to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to understand that it's time for us to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can rely on U.S.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington," said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke Saturday at the U.N. General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the heads of state at the Singapore summit.
Ri's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is set to resume deadlocked diplomacy on nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met with Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "far-fetched dream" to believe that extended sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is wary of adopting a declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up an arsenal of weapons that the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own security has been met with widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is slated to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Shows showcase the latest collection of large headwear that will soon be on your street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover up the sun completely, you don’t have to keep looking.
At their SS19 collection show, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of special over-sized headwear that dazzled the style circles at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical headwear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows too.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather brim, which almost completely covered the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon adorned with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Several of the colorful masks had sewn lips, and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation with a snorkel and a mask was more like a scuba device, and another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big-screen fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are about to appear on the streetscape.
The extravagantly sized hats strictly follow "La Bomba," a straw hat with six-foot brims that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the impractical hat, which was widely seen on social media, also inspired another large creation for fashion shows – the straw beach bag, which is almost as big as the model carrying it.
A scorched orange raffia bag lined with reed trim with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation from Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large-sized hats and beach bags in the streetscape next summer – designers have made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.'
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
Learning outcomes in Scotland's private schools have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good trial results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community-based projects.
These schools of more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by SCIS, Scotland's private schools council, aim to deliver a high level of service to their pupils as well as pupils' parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for careers of their choice, further and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an operator in the field of education who can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed that the status of languages as a popular and desired subject continues in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in their own language, the message goes to their heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to establish relationships with people in other countries.
From the latest trial results this year, we find that languages top the lists in terms of pass rate among private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data was collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS. Based on the data, it was found that of the students who received the best grade of A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's private schools support foreign language learning as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are held in the same esteem as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment Agency found that 17% of situations where employers had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by inadequate language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote the future career development of young people.
The more language skills are required for potential jobs, the more relevant these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied a second language, they will have an advantage in the future from this lifelong skill, no matter what career they have chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a person with language skills ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 poll commissioned by YouGov, out of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 per cent are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, with French the only language known by a double-digit 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important now for today’s children.
Knowledge of the languages of developing countries, in particular, gives children a better chance to find meaningful careers.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposedly important to UK residents in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scotland's private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high standards to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron to make debut Sunday at San Diego
The wait for supporters waiting for LeBron James to make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in a preseason game in San Diego.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and fewer than 48" said Walton on the Lakers' official Web site.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play incomplete minutes.
James, who was watching practice, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' preseason six games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more advance matches to prepare," he said.
Time for Trump's West Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic sites like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his election to fill the vacant seat of a Supreme Court justice, Trump is looking to boost support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing the majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event will begin at 7 p.m. East Coast time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event livestreamed online via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to address this week's hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who became impassioned over sexual harassment charges that have delayed a Senate confirmation vote by as much as a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigns is to prop up the success of Republican candidates in a tight November election.
Thus, comments about President Trump's campaign during these next five week events are intended to "wake up volunteers and supportive Republicans to protect and expand the majorities that prevail in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so essential to his purposes that the president is willing to travel to as many states as he possibly can during the busy campaign season," an anonymous representative for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Today's venue is the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and supporters from as many as "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" could arrive, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit in the current month to West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is endorsing Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to grow his support in the polls," said political scientist Simon Haeder of West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows fighting spirit to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles matches
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes was just what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-reinforcing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this one.
Where, they say, is this force for success at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we'll take this power of success as a dab," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: four points ahead with 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot to be encouraged by, such as the fitness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who allowed them to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior off the tee to the green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat noises of victory celebration intensified as his round progressed, when he managed a critical putt to level the match at even-par four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt to win the 15th match was followed by a similar shout, which gave the impression that he believes the United States team has not lost yet.
"You've got to focus really well and just take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to impress.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but endearing duo have won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo not to make any bogeys Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the final nine holes Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this boisterous crowd, confirms that they are favourites on Sunday. And when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, there could be no other more popular player to secure a potential European victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Admittedly, talk of European success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, paired with Alex Noren, the morning foursomes hero.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and Swede so deep into a hole that they were nowhere near making it out of there.
But on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-ball are fascinating to watch from the point of view of cooperation between couples: what kind of advice they give or don't give, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a considerable lead ahead of the final day, but this quadruple showed that the United States team has the fighting spirit, even though there is suspicion, especially in the United States.
Europe take 10-6 lead ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe are in a good lead ahead of the final day of the Ryder Cup after they took a 10-6 lead over the United States in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning run with two wins over a rattling Tiger Woods, and had the points tally up to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who struggled hard to retain the victory they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a poorly played United States team in the morning fourballs, taking the match to 3-1.
The U.S. were the tougher opponent in the doubles, winning two games, but they couldn't narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 double figures to retain victory.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also collectively called "Molliwood," were the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games.
After first smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they then finished a supremely discouraged Woods and US rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more emphatic at 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday's two games, was very brilliant at times, yet has lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursomes, and as many as seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested his morning fourballs but returned with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this crisp and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major title winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the Americans by two points Saturday.
They acquired a gutsy 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the foursomes, however, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team gone from a four-point chasing position to level at the start of double figures, although Furyk's side also draw enough to retain victory.
Although after two days of being second best it may be that Sunday's counter-attack is too much to ask.
North Korea 'absolutely' won't disarm itself without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under the circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, including ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a test site for nuclear tests and promising that North Korea would not increase the number of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States," he said, "we cannot be certain of the survival of national security, so in such circumstances, the fact that we would disarm ourselves unilaterally is not possible."
While Ri repeated the familiar lament that Washington will not accept a phase-out of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate point, his statement is nonetheless significant in that unilateral disarmament was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri was referring to the joint statement Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In the statement, Kim asserted "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denuclearization first,' and has ramped up pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force -- even opposing the 'declaration of peace,'" Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a wishful dream of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the party calling for disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a dead end."
Still, Ri's tone was noticeably different from last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting missiles at the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "evil President" Trump called Kim a suicidal "missile man."
As recently as last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea. This year, however, Trump lavished praise on Kim for his courage in approaching the abandonment of weapons, while still stressing that much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea gives up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he doesn't have a time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the advances already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of Security Council sanctions must continue to be strong and not fail until we witness a full, final and confirmed abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea since 2006, with the aim of blunting Pyongyang's funding channels for ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met with North Korea's Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. He also announced he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for another summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
On leaving Pyongyang, he described progress being made. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to closing the missile base and nuclear facility in a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States carries out "equivalent measures."
Pompeo said Kim means by "similar measures" the security guarantees Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an instructional course for adequate rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are taking part in a course this year designed to increase student rest. The course is a counter to the macho culture thriving at the university, where students press long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the world’s best university are often quite ignorant of the basics related to their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School who is working on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who designed the course, believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, in my final year of college?'
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I found surprising," he told the Telegraph in an interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the university's vice president of health services, says the university ended up running the course after hearing about how students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the study week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can snap coffee cups, curtains, sports gear and books, thereby gaining insights into the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In another section, participants are told about how long-term sleep deprivation can raise the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this will not have an immediate impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe they have a right to know about these issues in exactly the same way they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
All-night study marathons, Professor Czeisler says, are still a matter of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting enough and quality sleep should be students' 'secret weapon' against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state in the brain that resembles starvation, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
She says the course opened her eyes and provided the impetus to run a course covering all students on campus.
He hopes all graduate students will be able to complete a similar set of studies before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students set an alarm clock to also remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning, as well as urging them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot snatches victory from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and Rangers suffered another losing day as Dolly Menga's shot through a disintegrated defence brought a 1-0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February's 4-1 game against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time around, and Gerrard now suffered only his second defeat in his 18-game career as manager. Rangers remained eight points adrift of current Premier League leader Hearts.
Menga fired the ball goalwards seven minutes before half-time and, with Rangers having dropped the will to fight, was then no longer levelling things up.
Rangers dropped to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston have instead climbed to third place, with only Hibernian higher on goal difference.
Rangers may have other problems ahead, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the away stand hit him in the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up with which the team had beaten Ayr and progressed to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 set-up to take the team a point clear of Hearts last week. The same strategy paid off again as a well-built line-up managed to discipline an opponent at almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston were better at using situations to their own advantage.
Livingston had an opportunity to get a goal as early as the two-minute mark when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free pass for Allan McGregor's goal. But Pittman failed to capitalise on the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free-kick to Craig Halkett, but fellow defender Alan Lithgow only managed to fire wide of the back post.
Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the final third of the game there was no more poise in the air.
Alfredo Morelos claimed a penalty after a collision with Steven Lawless on fifteen minutes, but the Colombian's requests were ignored by referee Steven Thomson.
Rangers managed just two tries in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly deflected Lassana Coulibaly's bulldozer and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal on 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it was not just because of the team's hard work.
Still, the Rangers could do nothing about Jacobs' long pass tactics.
There was no reaction from Scott Arfield when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who coolly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
In the changeover Gerrard decided to switch Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the pitch. The switch had an almost immediate impact on the game as Kent created a fitting opening for Morelos. However, the attack was cut short by Kelly's impressively quick defence.
Livingston had the visitors playing their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued to make one long pass after another.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their lead in the final moments of the game. But McGregor's fine defence blocked Jacobs's effort before Lithgow could get into position at a corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton also claimed a penalty kick after clashing with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked offside.
Almanac: Geigerometer inventor
Next, a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany on this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geigerometer.
The method became one of the mainstays of science, and the meter also became a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronadon bells," in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play scientists who seem quite like cowboys, fits well:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you place your headphones on, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really cracking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine able to teach immune system to 'see' malignant cells
New cancer vaccine able to teach immune system to 'see' malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ proteins typical of many cancers
The co-vaccine has given promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared in the 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, US, describes the method: "Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "guides the growth of multiple types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer as well as cancers of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach, taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells, has also yielded results in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was slammed by critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live while wearing a campaign hat.
The show didn't go as planned
Kanye West got some boos in his neck on "Saturday Night Live" after praising President Donald Trump in raucous style and announcing he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town," dressed in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism was an issue, I would have moved from America ages ago," he notes.
Tonight's broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon sneering at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing relates to allegations of sexual assault by Kavanaugh made by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's rant was not aired live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a snippet of it to social media.
It's unclear whether Rock is intent on mocking West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he was mistreated because of the hat he wore behind the scenes.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage wearing this hat.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll still say I'm on the margins," West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see what it means to be on the margins?" and says he wears a Superman cape because "then you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love.”
According to Variety, West's comments churned out boos from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the magazine as: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was chosen on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is endorsed by conservative TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who praised his courage in a tweet: "THANK YOU WHEN THE VICTIMS SPEAK."
But Karen Hunter, who runs the chat show, tweeted that West "is just being himself, which is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I can choose NOT to support a person (by buying their music or clothing brand or supporting their "art") who I believe supports and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same goes for us," he added.
The rapper announced ahead of his night's appearance on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician here follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and subsequently to the artist formerly known as Prince.

The defendant is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
'Game of Thrones' actor star Kit Harington tackles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series "Game of Thrones."
But Harrington has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero: According to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times culture supplement, Harrington doubts that "something has gone wrong" on the issue, and questions the means in place to tackle toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Harrington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, also a member of the Game of Thrones, admits to a strong desire to address the issue.
"The question of where we've gone wrong with masculinity is stirring up strong feelings in me at the moment," he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to the problems we now see?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters on it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: "what is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain way to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
There’s something really wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of prequels or sequels to The Throne Game after the show ends next summer because, in his own words, he has "had enough of the battlefields and the horses."
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, about a film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best thing the Game of Thrones has offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," he says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow, played by Harrington, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: Number of new infections has increased by 14% in China
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
Health officials say the virus is affecting the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, marking a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people living with HIV and contracting AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many disease infections are caused by inadequate protection in such relationships.
Starting in 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to guarantee universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters Denies Employee Leaked Republican Senator's Data and Accuses Her of Spreading 'Dangerous Lies' and 'Conspiracy Theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her staffer posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about them.
A Democratic representative from Los Angeles asserted that the claims are being disseminated by "far-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," says Waters in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the information released reportedly were the home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, who represents South Carolina, and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, who represent the state of Utah.
The unidentified person released the information Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a Senate committee hearing. The hearing was on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that, according to the Hillin newspaper, the messages were released from an IP address attached to Waters' office and by a person on Waters' staff.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employee whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and absolutely untrue."
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism on the Internet, with critics also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It appears that his character is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something they have not done, there is no reason for them to behave in a hostile manner.
There's no reason for defiance.
There is no reason to question the motives of the prosecution.
You have to behave calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is vying for Waters' seat in the midterm congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said she had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies in response to these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for any destructive and dangerous actions taken against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English: Underperforming Rowan Atkinson's Agent Parody
There is already a well-established tradition of looking for Brexit references in any film with a slight tilt towards the UK. However, this doesn't seem to fit with the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series, which originated in 2003 with a Johnny English rant and came back to life with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English – Born Again."
Can a tongue-in-cheek satire of a nation become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the glaring-eyed, rubber-faced and incompetent Johnny English has earned his licence to screw up for the second time. His very name speaks above all of the fact that this is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It's about that dimwitted secret agent, of course, who desperately seeks to spirit around the suave glamour but appears a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that hapless one-note musician at the 2012 London opening concert.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mystical man of the world who left chaos behind, and who was originally portrayed by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The latest show does have its moments.
I particularly liked the scene where Johnny English arrives by helicopter dressed in medieval armour, with rotor blades denting his helmet.
Atkinson's gifts of physical comedy make their way out, but the humour itself seems underperforming and curiously unnecessary especially because ‘serious' film brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now provide humour as part of the film's central content.
The humor seems aimed at children, and Johnny English's wacky treatment doesn't strike me as inventive and astute as Atkinson's comedy of Mr. Bean's silent roles.
The recurring premise each year is that the UK is in dire straits.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all the British agents operating in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty – portrayed as a woefully small performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for an exuberant and pinched Prime Minister who is already up to his ears in a swamp of political opprobrium: Emma Thompson is doing all she can in the skins of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just doesn't provide her with sufficient space.
As the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already stepped aside from active duty must be summoned.
It is Johnny English in his own person, of course. He spends his retirement as an upscale school teacher, while giving informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject churns out some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-type lessons for the secrets of intelligence gathering.
English is whisked off to an emergency meeting in Whitehall to reunite with his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander in whose role Vicki Pepperdine can't seem to get to her rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's Secret Service to confront Ophelia Bhuletova, the fatal super-criminal played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is about to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire. Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey immediately turns into a farce: the two, disguised as waiters, set fire to a fancy French restaurant and cause chaos as they secretly seek to board Volta's luxury yacht. An attempt to explore Volta's house using virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
The last inhibitions of the filmmakers fade when we get to the final scene, but despite all the power and charm, the film still feels a bit made for a child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
When watching Johnny English films, I’ve come to the same conclusion: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
UK Labour denies plans for four-day working week with five days' pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan to make British people work four days a week but pay for five days.
The party is reportedly calling on business leaders to pass on the savings generated by the AI revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
Under the plan, workers would be able to enjoy three-day weekends at the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit in" with the party's economic agenda and its plans to tilt politics in favor of workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the move to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source tells the Sunday Times newspaper: "A review of the line-out should be announced before the turn of the year.
Change won't happen overnight, but the four-day working week is a target that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first body to endorse the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the move to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
But the target will not win undivided support within Labour's ranks.
A Labour spokesman states: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party is not considering moving to one."
John McDonnell, the shadow Treasury secretary, drew on a work conference last week to set out his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "faceless dictators" and "speculators" of utility companies.
Under the shadow Treasury secretary's plans, existing shareholders in water companies would not be able to recoup their stake in full because a Labour-led government could enforce "reductions" based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10 per cent of the share capital of private sector companies to employee management. Under the plan, a single employee would be paid a maximum of £500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on "60 Minutes" whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed by at least a week the final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could sway support among some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's nomination.
In an episode of "60 Minutes" that airs Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it might be possible for the FBI to find out things that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said as I went into the hearing... I said I've had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the allegations came up, and asked him ‘did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, by contrast, looks set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombshell," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know the following: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named were able to confirm that.
It is a 36 year old thing.
I don’t see what could change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival on Saturday in New York, is a music event with a cast as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Now running for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York's Central Park to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to publicize the event's real goal: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "acts" such as volunteering, send an e-mail message to a political decision-maker or make a phone call, or perform some other act that spreads awareness of the project's goals.
But how has Global Citizen fared, now that the target is only 12 years away?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clicktivism’ among others – the fantasy that you can change the world by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded more than 19 million "deeds" for various ends as of 2011.
It says these actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles that are equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been used in a way that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations, on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds achieved have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide to date.
Chief among the commitments, for example, is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based grouping of investors and executors committed to "helping children develop to their full potential." The group committed to providing Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the country. This was after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of Global Citizen's campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and global citizens just like you, we can pass social injustice and malnutrition onto the leaves of history," Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for Power of Nutrition, said to the crowd at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also said the British government was urged to take action to improve maternal and child nutrition through more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on tackling malnutrition and reaches 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions column on the movement's website reads: "why do you think we can bring an end to extreme poverty?"
The Global citizen's response: "The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks lie ahead of us.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we will be stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the movement's New York concert this year, with a stellar cast that includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
U.S. Interior Department says country can hamper energy exports by using Navy as 'barrier'
According to Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of the Interior, Washington can "if necessary" rely on its navy to prevent the spread of Russian energy on world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s action in Syria – at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext for probing new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia's] reason for presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as it is in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinke is quoted as saying.
The official said there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The U.S. has the ability to keep shipping routes open with its navy and, if necessary, blockaded to ensure that the energy they provide doesn't end up in the world market," he says.
Zinke was speaking to an audience at an event organized by the Association of Energy Consumers, a nonprofit group that profiles itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches toward Russia and Iran by noting that it's one and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing one fuel with another," he says, describing Russia as a "one-trick circus number" with an economy based on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with a situation in which the Trump administration has sought to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace it with significantly cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow's leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is designed to double the 110 billion cubic meters of transmission capacity of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and sees it as an example of unhealthy competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has caused a backlash in Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella group, the Confederation of German Industry, has urged the United States to steer clear of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third state is interfering in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Confederation of German Industry, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, plans to carefully consider" running in the presidential election in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced Saturday that she was "carefully considering" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed she was considering running in an open question session in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed administration, and this also means a woman in a leadership position in the kingdom," she said, according to The Hill newspaper.
"After the 6th of November," he said, "I will carefully consider running for president."
Warren took stock of President Donald Trump during the event by saying "he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I worry about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, an opinion poll released on Thursday found that a majority of Warren's constituents do not support this running in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University School of Political Studies and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support a senator running.
32% were in favour of standing as a candidate.
More of those polled supported former Gov. Deval Patrick running for reelection with 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates raised in the debates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will formally decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war trauma at Donald Trump's election rally
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested overnight Monday and read charges of domestic violence
"From what my own son will have to go through when he returns home I can very much identify with other families who will have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our soldiers returning home will bear," he told an audience gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma for Donald Trump's election rally.
Palin called the arrest "a hippo in the living room" and said her son, like other military veterans, "will come home a little changed, they'll come back hardened, they'll come back wondering if there's respect for what he and his comrades in the Army and the Air Force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, she was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun while intoxicated.
Eighteen states and the Federal District of Columbia support the lawsuit against the new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Federal District of Columbia are seeking an amendment to a new policy enacted in the United States that does not grant asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and union districts have filed a Friends of the Court letter Friday in Washington. The letter supports asylum seekers who violate the policy, reports NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name has not been made public in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit, which was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy.
He says he was assaulted by his partner "and his sons who are part of a violent gang." U.S. authorities denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where much of the asylum seekers in the United States come from, as states where gang and domestic violence is a pervasive problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeals for Asylum Claims that allowed undocumented immigrants to claim asylum on the grounds of domestic violence.
Karl Racine, U.S. Attorney for the Federal District of Columbia, commented in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and an obstacle of this nature violates this principle" the Friends of the Court letter says.
Prosecutors also allege in the letter the practice of blocking access to asylum seekers is hurting the U.S. economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring needed additional manpower."
The public prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered judges hearing immigration cases in June to suspend granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is intended for persons fleeing their home country because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a particular social class," Sessions announced in a statement issued on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious ones, that people face all over the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palu – the death toll has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she soothes her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulances are bringing in new bodies by the minute.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents are returning to their destroyed homes, picking through their waterlogged belongings and trying to salvage what still remains to be salvaged.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers spinal and shoulder fractures, rest outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent, strong aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he recounts how a ferocious earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
'We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I got pinned down between the rubble of the wall, I guess." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and reports that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what's happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe.'
US ambassador accuses China of 'provoking' with 'propaganda announcements'
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool. This comes a week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily praising the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade deal.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid annex of the China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa by circulation, after accusing China of interfering in the Nov. 6 congressional elections. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to meddle in the U.S. election mark a new phase in Washington's widening campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials speaking to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to circulate announcements to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an ever-escalating trade war, with both sides in turn imposing tariffs on the other side's exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China’s retaliatory tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime Iowa state governor says Beijing has done harm to working people, farmers and businesses in the United States. Iowa is a big exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now ramping up its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press" wrote Branstad in an opinion piece published Sunday in the Des Moines Register.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is benefiting from the United States' revered traditions of free speech and the press by placing a paid notice in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"In Beijing's street newsstands, by contrast, there are only limited signs of dissent, and the real, dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers dodged an offer to publish" an article he wrote, but does not specify which paper.
Kavanaugh fiasco deters female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republican names are standing behind and defending Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh could cause a backlash, according to analysts, particularly among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have taken a big toll, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to move forward with a vote.
"You can't undo these things," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell Institute, says in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't think Sen. Jeff Flake's (Republicans, Arizona) last-minute bid for an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for MoveOn, a national reform grouping, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate as the ruling Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are not going to be estimable anymore," says Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has been high already, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among the precarious female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible backlash if Republicans move forward with confirmation even before Ford's evidentiary hearing against a Supreme Court nominee making his case for sexual assault.
"This is becoming a shambles for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, told NBC News early last week.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed under questioning. It's about how Republicans have acted on the issue and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, executive director of the pro-Democrat group Priorities USA, pointed out to the news outlet.
But Americans seem somewhat divided on whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh with a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushed ahead, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh molested her while she was drunk when Ford was 17.
Ramirez alleges the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new Internet as backlash against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a start-up to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes Inrupt's purpose is to "rule the world."
"It needs to be done now," he said, referring to his start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal repository," or POD.
It can include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The firm calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The firm currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some paid developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications using the tools available on Inrupt's website. This will all be available from this week.
Berners-Lee says she and her team won't discuss with "Facebook and Google whether people are going to be offered a complete transformation in which all their business models are turned on their head overnight."
"We will not seek their consent."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will retain his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after Inrupt's launch.
"I am extremely optimistic for the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: town remembers First World War hero priest
The city is celebrating the Church of England's only Victoria Cross Medal-winning, soldiered-on priest as 100 years have passed since the events.
The Medal of Bravery was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Rev. Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918 for the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
But Vann died from a sniper's bullet four days later without ever learning of the highest British Army honour he received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quent "in very dense fog and under heavy field gun and machine gun fire."
Later, he surged to the front line and, "showing the greatest bravery," led the advance of the troops before storming off alone to field gunnery. In the ensuing battle, Vann downed three gun battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve like, something that inspires respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann laid a wreath after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honour to be able to take part in the parade" and added: "a great crowd of people are there to remember the glory of a genuine hero."
MMA fans waited all night for Bellator 206 – TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you've been up all night to watch the highly anticipated Bellator 206 tournament, and the entire event isn't presented.
The programme for the event in San Jose featured 13 matches, including six main series matches, and the show was to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the ring, the programme switched to Pipsa Possu to the great dismay of viewers.
Some spectators were not exactly delighted after staying up all night for the match.
One mixed martial arts friend opened up on Twitter, describing replacing the fight with a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke."
"According to the law, the content in question was not appropriate for airing at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch it to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior associate vice president for marketing and communications for the program switch.
"Pips Pig, yes".
Bellator director Scott Coker said timetables will be worked on to allow UK viewers to follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a rebroadcast to probably make the show work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning there and we can't get the programme aired until Sunday our time, which in turn is Monday their time.
We are working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, the messages started going one way or the other and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual. We tried to offer our fans more and tried too much.
This is a sad state of affairs."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt low because of his sexuality
Swim jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. However, this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says she only discovered when she entered secondary school that "not everyone is the same as me."
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, Daley says he spoke about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
She also talks about how after having a child, winning at the Olympics was no longer that important.
Longtime radio host Kristy Young has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt 'less' than everyone else when he was young because it was 'not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs'.
To this day, these feelings, to feel less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed.
He said he wanted to show that he was “something” so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games to plead for homosexuality to be criminalised in other countries.
He said he came forward because he feels lucky to live openly without repercussions, and wanted to give “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion says her falling in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 – "came as a surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner 20 years older than himself last year, but says the age gap has never been an issue.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age" – she attended her first Olympics when she was 14 and her father died of cancer three years later – "it's hard to find another person of a similar age who has gone through similar ups and downs," Daley tells me.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which has resulted in Daley's "whole perspective" changing.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a gold Olympic medal.
Robbie's my Olympic gold medal.'
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 aged just 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about was the tickets for the 2012 Olympics. He wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he's not going to be around anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held her hand as her breathing stopped. It was only when her breathing had indeed stopped and she was dead that I finally understood that she was not invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I'd dreamed of all my life – to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley tells me.
This was also the inspiration for her first song choice on the air – Heather Small's song "Proud" – which stirred emotions even as she was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gives her skin goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Semi-fit Mickelson on bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he will need to peter out appreciably to avoid the record round going down in history as a calamitous performance.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Usually the center of attention, the American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the court trying to get a handle on her batting.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who even at the peak of his career was not considered one of the most accurate drivers, is not an ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National course, where the tall-bodied rough punishes inaccurate strokes.
If the field itself isn't enough of a match for Mickelson, Sunday's ninth game will be up against renowned British Open winner Francesco Molinari for his accuracy, playing alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who aims to snap a streak of all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at 12 entering the doubles, get off to a flying start, Michelson's game could prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player but what else could be said in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played in today. He patted me on the back, crunched me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is arguably among the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he would play two games.
I imagined otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be on that court as much as anybody else.""
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also spell the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which admittedly was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something unspecified to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes banter at people's expense and he's a funny guy that everyone likes company with," he explains.
"The younger players probably had a lot of fun with him this week as well. It's amusing to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.""
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long a lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a sizable Ryder Cup lead before the final day's doubles could become a bumpy ride.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the Seve Ballesteros-led side held a five-point lead over the Americans, but who emerged victorious with lime lines just about the length of their noses and won by the narrowest possible margin of 141⁄2 to 51⁄2.
"You remind yourself how we led briskly at Valderrama, we led briskly at Brookline, where we lost, but we won at Valderrama, albeit narrowly," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving to a 10-13 lead at Le Golf National course.
History will show both me and everyone else in the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to go out on the field and do everything right.
The game isn't over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that prize, and we're just aiming for that.
As I have always said, my focus is on these 12 players who play for our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted with how his team's players have performed on a difficult pitch, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until I tip over in things like this.
Tomorrow is completely different.
The priority tomorrow will be individual performances, and that's when we'll be talking about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re alone on the field, your player’s capacity is tested.
That is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players – tomorrow everyone will be capable of the best performance.
Now we have to give up the partner, who is allowed to go [to the field alone] as well and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will demand a better performance from his players as individuals than they were able to partner. The exceptions to this are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has had final-day turnarounds both ways. He was part of the team that won at Brookline before ending up a loser when the European team won with a "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he replied to a question about how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw handed his team's ranks for the final day's tryouts.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow but we want to get a fast start just like happened at Brookline, or like happened at Medinah.
When you get it moving in one direction, it piles plenty of pressure on the middle games.
We've adjusted our line-up accordingly and we'll put the boys on the pitch the way we want to, as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow.""
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defensive battle and will face Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to face their European counterparts.
"I put the guys in the group in this order because I think it carries through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his doubles picks.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate in the German navy should have been commissioned in 2014. The ship is intended to replace aging Cold War-era equipment, but will not be commissioned until next year at the earliest because of faulty systems and exponentially rising expenses, according to local media reports.
According to a military spokesman speaking to Die Zeit newspaper, the commissioning of the ‘Rheinland-Palatinate’, the first ship in the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have haunted the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to available information, they will be equipped with powerful cannon, missile systems for combating air and surface ships, and stealth technology, such as technology that reduces radar reflectivity and the detectability of infrared and acoustic signals.
One of the important features of the ship is its longer maintenance interval – the new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without calling at home port.
However, continuing delays mean that state-of-the-art warships, said to be designed to improve German influence in overseas territories, are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to officially commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss' shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship since it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in the German media of essential "software and equipment failures" that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships have a crew size of around 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship is noticeably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's scope for subsequent upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, the Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a stunning €3.1bn, compared with an initial price of €2.2bn.
Problems with making the new frigates available have emerged amid recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, pointed out earlier this year that the navy's usable ships "are running low."
The authority said the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been taken out of service but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He lamented the fact that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could have been commissioned by the navy.
Environmental group eavesdrops on bats' hidden lives
A new study being carried out in an area in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats make use of the terrain when hunting for food.
It is hoped the new research will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation measures.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will observe bunting and dwarf bats, as well as ear moths and waterfowl in the grounds of the Inverewe Garden, a botanical garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special recording devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor bat activity during the season.
The organization's employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the pronunciations and the species concerned are verified by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report is created in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organisation's conservation adviser hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats, and how different species exploit them.
The information helps in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined substantially over the past 100 years.
Construction and earthworks threaten bat resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echolocation technology to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organisation dedicated to protecting the rural environment, maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 remarkable gardens and 76,000 acres across the country – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, spot checks and, in some cases, animal rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat-only reserve on the grounds of Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway. Eight of Scotland's ten bat species are found in the area.
Farm manager David Thompson says the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave suits bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us better understand what bats need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before undertaking remediation work, as the disposal of a single bat resting place can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for bat conservation, is encouraging the public to get involved in conservation work.
He says: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and we don't yet know how their populations will fare."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers prepare case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to try Der Spiegel, the German magazine that published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for nondisclosure, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on an Instagram livestream to his 142 million followers just hours after the claims were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news."
"Oh, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they have called what Reuters news agency called "invalid reporting of privacy-related suspicions."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding restitution for "mental suffering in accordance with the seriousness of the violation, which means probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to papers filed in Nevada's Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo got down on one knee after the alleged incident and told her he "was 99 per cent a good guy" but whose "one per cent" disappointed.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed the pair had sex but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims she visited the police station and took photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later reached a settlement because she was "terrified of the possibility of retaliation" and worried she would "be subjected to public humiliation."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking a reversal of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to an agreement to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and joined Italian powerhouse Juventus in a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' ending car manufacturing
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he found it "worrying" the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby, if the UK exits the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of border delays will be reflected in job losses if no deal is reached on Brexit.
The factory in Burnaston – where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK abruptly exits the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions to production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other UK-based carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears over exit from the European Union in how cross-border trade will play out.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini manufacturing plant for a month in the event of Brexit.
The main concern touches on what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT basis, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and the cars are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Holding more than 24 hours of stock at the Derbyshire plant is unacceptable, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best possible deal, which not only amounts to success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity we have to take advantage of," he says on BBC Radio 4"s Today programme.
"Not only statements from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers show that we absolutely need to be able to continue with the series of supply chains that have worked very well so far."
Toyota can't say how long production would be halted, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union trustee at the plant, says concern is growing among members: "In my experience, the jobs lost will never come back.
A government spokesman says: "We need to set out a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "have to be postponed another week" due to the uproar surrounding Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who in turn is investigating Russian meddling in the election, Trump aides' ties to Russia and any action the president may have taken to obstruct justice.
Rumors have been circulating in Washington for months that Trump plans to fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of the president's removal on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has disputed the report's data.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has reportedly been to remove Rosenstein from office.
But President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the day of the meeting was announced as Thursday.
Trump said he would "preferably not" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its timing coincided with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weeklong FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further postponing a vote in the Senate plenary session.
Trump's press chief, Sarah Sanders, appeared on "Fox News Sunday."
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "No date for this has been set. It could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week because of everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is for reasons other than distaste for the "attention-seeking" of TV reporters, yet noted, "I don't dispute the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more question hours than any president before him," he says, adding without quoting evidence yet: "We've checked those numbers."
"There will still be press conferences," Sanders said, but "it's infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States than to have a conversation with me.
We often try to act this way and you've seen us act this way a number of times over the last several weeks, and this is going to replace the press release so you can speak directly with the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open-ended events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president possibly pointed to the reason for this in his uninhibited and occasionally bizarre appearance before the assembled reporters.
The Health Secretary wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries over fears about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written a letter to Scottish health system workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and wishes for them to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government is already braced to cover the cost of applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in specialist public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate now how much we value the contributions of each of our employees, regardless of citizenship.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.'
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery for head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has had emergency surgery after the team's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessean reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply slumped into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the sideline for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State trustee told WSMV Channel reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "the type/extent of injury is not known at this point," and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University and is playing his first season with the team since his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be hit with higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be hit with higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless under new plans from the Conservative Party.
The change is designed to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
Raising stamp duty applies to those who do not pay tax to the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will be briefing today on the higher stamp duty rate charged to foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises on more affordable housing and has drawn attention to the taxation of the well-off.
Raising stamp duty will be targeted at people and businesses who do not pay tax to the UK. The extra money from this will be diverted into government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The surcharge - which will be added to the current stamp duty on top of the second homes and investment housing increases added two years ago - could be as high as three per cent.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer expects the increase to generate up to £120 million annually.
An estimated 13 per cent of new-build homes in London are bought by non-UK permanent residents, pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers in the market for owner-occupied homes.
Many affluent areas of the UK – particularly in its capital – have become ‘ghost towns’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson set out a cut in stamp duty as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first homes.
He accused big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and failing to build it, and urged Prime Minister May to reject quotas on affordable housing to remedy Britain's "housing disgrace."
Mr Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including limits on rents and an end to "negligent evictions."
He would also like to give councils more power over matters relating to the construction of new homes.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I intended to dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream – that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor's.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For too many people, home ownership has become far too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland's national team'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become manager of the Scotland team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enthusiastic about the challenge of bringing the team that holds the north-east corner of the country back to its feet. The team are currently in third place in the British second division.
Ross moved to the "stadium of lights" this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the second team and that was it," Ross tells BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
"As a kid I used to watch Scotland games with my dad a lot of the time at Hampden, and that's something that's always drawn me back.
This is the kind of opportunity you only get if you're successful as a club manager".
Rossi's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic director says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his prominent predecessors at a club of great stature. He has previously turned down offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment I am measuring my own success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and capability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"Getting there won't be easy, but I'd probably only consider myself successful if I can pilot a team back to the Premier League."
Ross has only been manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's assistant manager and then for 15 months in the Heats' coach group.
He then helped Alloa emerge from relegation games in series three and elevated St Mirren from relegation fitness to champions over the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than at any time during his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at an actual crossroads with my career," he recalls of the time he took over at Alloa.
"I genuinely believed I was better suited as a manager than as a player.
It sounds strange because I was playing well, earning moderately well and getting to enjoy some relatively big successes.
But playing can be tough.
A player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like the stress and the pressure of the job, but managing the team just feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for a living. I feel better in my own body than I ever have in my adult life".
The full interview will be available to listen to on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is at 5.30pm on Saturday, research shows
The summer heatwave has given a kick to pubs struggling with Britain's difficulties, but at the same time heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.
The statistics show that sales at pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, of business consultancy firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunny weather and England's longer-than-anticipated involvement in the football World Cup meant that July formed like June with pub sales 2.8% higher, while the month was even worse for restaurants.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drinks side fared the best. Their like-for-like sales increased more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffered from the heat, but less dramatically than those running restaurants.
It seems people just wanted out with drinking in mind.
Sales of drinks at pubs and bars run by businesses increased by 6.6% over the month, with a 3% drop in food sales."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hotel hospitality consultancy, says: "The results continue a trend that has been going on since late April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the out-of-home meal market.
It's no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, though the 4.8% year-over-year sales decline is stinging especially now that the industry is currently grappling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer couldn't have come with a worse seam for food-focused operators, and only time will tell if August's milder temperatures bring the respite the industry desperately needs.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants combined, including new restaurants opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One-fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of children – some as young as 11 – hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, a study says
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of the growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that accounts could be used to share sexually-tinged content
20 per cent of pupils said they hold a 'main account' shown to parents
A fifth of children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed the existence of the fast-growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refer to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content may be posted on the accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they keep a cleaned-up 'main account' for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped, after coming across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Principals Advisory Council (HMC) found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 16 held two separate profiles, with half of respondents admitting to holding secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online facilities where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle to be 'voice of athletes' on Scottish athletes' board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletes" Board as a non-executive member. She will take part in the governing body's annual general assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated all-rounder. Board chairman Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international-level experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidh is hugely respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I'm sure Scotland's athletes would benefit hugely from her appointment to the board," Beattie says.
Doyle says: "I look forward to my role as a mouthpiece for athletes and hope I can be of use and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction."
The American athlete who won four Olympic gold medals, winning the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who is now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient circulatory failure in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say only time will tell if I recover and in what condition.
This has been exhausting work, but I've made a full recovery, learned to walk again and now I'm already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Ad likening mothers to cows divides opinion online
An advertisement that equates breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows by a breast-pumping company has divided opinion on the Internet.
Elvie, which makes consumer tech, has launched a product dubbed the "world's first silent and wearable breast pump." Its marketing is boosted by a tongue-in-cheek commercial that adapts the style of music videos, describing the freedom the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see the tail" and "in case you didn't happen to notice, they're not udders but it's boobs."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
But an ad on the company's Facebook page caused debate online.
The video, which has attracted 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it pokes fun at the dairy industry's daily 'horrors'.
"Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk. However, their babies are stolen from them soon after giving birth," one commenter writes.

Another viewer commented: "Understandably it's traumatic for mum and baby alike.
But why can't they be used to promote the breast pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?'
A third commenter added: "Perfectly reality-obsessed ad."
The ad also got me some defenders: one woman admitted she thought the ad was "funny."
'I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a genius product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mums who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and 'feel like cows'.
The ad is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced with discreet pumps tucked into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and fits discreetly inside breastfeeding vests, giving women the freedom to move around, hold the baby and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of the Mother advertising agency commented on the stir: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By juxtaposing breastfeeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using a breast pump into the spotlight, bringing out the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in an entertaining and relatable way."
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, the mother-of-two appeared on the catwalk in designer Marta Jakubowski's outfit using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to tent camp on Texas border quietly
The number of migrant children apprehended has increased sharply even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged. That's partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and signing up as a foster family can jeopardize their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy must provide their fingerprints, and that that information will be shared with immigration officials.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs official, testified last week in Congress about the agency's detention of dozens of people who had applied to be foster families for underage arrivals.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
So we will continue to look for these individuals," says Albence.
In an effort to deal with children's cases more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules requiring the case to be heard by a court within a month of capture, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, according to reception centre workers.
Many prefer to appear by videoconference rather than in person when pursuing their case before a court dealing with the arrivals.
Those deemed not eligible for assistance will be deported urgently.
According to reports from reception centre workers and the system in recent months, the amount of time children spend in captivity affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates say the concern is particularly pronounced at larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's desperation can go unnoticed because of the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering trauma as we speak.
Syria tells US, French, Turkish 'occupier forces' to leave immediately
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is fighting a war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were in the country illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "with them will be acted upon accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "sacred struggle until all of Syria is cleansed" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are largely training and guiding Arab forces opposed to the Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a contingent of more than 1,000 troops to the battle-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" encouraging refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicising an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the rebels' last stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to drive political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the region, which is home to 3 million people.
Moualem, however, has stressed that the agreement has "clear timelines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to create a draft of a postwar Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against getting involved.
Why Trump Will Be Elected to a Second Term
Following that logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal-leaning viewers are likely to hope, the suspension and scandal ends his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic decision of a presidency ever!"
To date, there have been no signs of fatigue in spectators.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared with 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has topped cable: with 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
"This is a blaze that attracts people because it's the kind of thing we don't understand," Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC's Designated Survivor, notes of the minister who emerges as president after the attack destroyed the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he plans to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied: "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell tells me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the news coming out of Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade case plays out, whether members of immigrant families get to each other, and how the global economy fares.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of an informed citizen to watch the sixth hour of a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skinned pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post, "a jostling garment of arrogance") and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' unvarnished descriptions of President Trump's anatomy.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario again.
"What he's doing feels like a reality show, because in part it's about him giving the audience something every night," notes Brent Montgomery, president of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Shop series about the changing characters and daily storylines of Trump's show (NFL altercation, praise for Kim Jong Un).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a lovely sunny day at his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go outside because he was watching MSNBC while taping CNN.
He could not disengage from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and at issue was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money pours in from outside for tight midterm election battle
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district has faced a veritable influx of money, as a reshuffle of congressional constituencies means two candidates already elected will have to fight for one seat.
This newly redistricting Pittsburg district is a combative challenge for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running a contest with another chosen candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th District, which overlaps the new 17th District.
The territorial split was remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old caucus division unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The contest in the new 17th constituency has triggered an economic struggle in the main party finance divisions of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar in Pennsylvania after the widely followed March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won in the district with 20 percent.
Political commentators have been predicting a fine head start for Democrats.
U.S. planned punishment for El Salvador over support for China, but backed away from its intentions
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already notched up Beijing's situation and Washington's mild response.
President Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization Group.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to recall American diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "based on recent policies that say Taiwan is no longer recognized," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the U.S. in 2017 for issues including drug control, as well as development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American nation, which has high unemployment and homicide rates, hard.
As internal meetings progressed, officials in North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity. The previous year's similar gathering was seen as a step in efforts to deter migrants from seeking to enter the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear they wanted the meeting to go ahead and this effectively ended speculation that El Salvador might be punished.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, some indication of the weight the administration will give to the gathering, diplomats noted.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new nasty messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House in Bolton declined to comment on the specifics of the conversation with the three American officials. The two diplomats involved agreed to discuss internal matters on condition of anonymity.
Their account was corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke under the protection of the condition of anonymity.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now very weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also reportedly directed an investigation into whether the Trump campaign secretly colluded with Russia at the time Russia interfered in the U.S. election.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and potentially be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs here, and I don't mean to say that the defeat of President Trump is inevitable - any more than the defeat of similar individuals in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those decisions will determine how long this struggle becomes.
In 1938, German officials would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history spirals to such turning points, where democracy's inexorable march forward is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been grilled ever since word became public that he had proposed a secret recording of the president's speech and pondered the president's potential inability to carry out his mission.
Rosenstein said The Times' account is incorrect.
"How will we react if the newly demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these steps, our democracy will face a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light sabbatical candles on that table adorned with swastikas.
How could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna encounter
Rangers face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday knowing that, after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier that month, victory over the Austrians would put the team in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from taking the field this season ahead of Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal are good opposition," states the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Maybe we would have been able to grab the win at the end, but overall a draw is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we got going in the second and we were better.
Thursday marks another important night in the Europa League.
Hopefully we can get the three points but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game. But I believe with the support of this crowd we will be able to give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough in terms of my own injuries and changes in the team, but now I feel good about the situation.
The line-up is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is going well.
Hopefully now we can press full-throttle, put the past season behind us and be successful.""
Fears over retirement savings take women out of sleep
While the study participants had a clear vision of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had spoken to loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they would discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they had spoken to their children about the issue.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't broach the subject," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor determining costs.
Involve a financial adviser in the discussion: advice can also help you figure out a way to cover these costs.
Funding options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance applied to cover these costs, or self-pay insurance if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in place so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a power of attorney to manage your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of your financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you can't take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his or her way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Can you answer any questions about your allergies and medications?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not all about the financial side. Who is his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medications are in use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan ready.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home late last night.
The victim, aged about forty, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police characterize the attack, which occurred around 2:30 a.m., as a "random act."
The victim did not see the assailant.
The victim's injuries are not life threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday. Officials say the toll is expected to increase.
Because communications to the area are down, rescue officials have not received any information from north of Palu in the Donggala municipal area, which is closer to the surface center of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary celebrations.
The municipality of Donggala stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the island of Sulawesi along the northwestern coastal line.
Donggala Municipality is an administrative area under the province with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the central Sulawesi province, and especially the coastal region of Donggala, are fishing and farming.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated at Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Return and Donggala has been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western state of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and suffers frequent earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra, off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, caused a tsunami on Dec. 26 that struck 14 nations and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coasts. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias in coastal Sumatra waters.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude quake struck south of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck off the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of Sumatra's Mentawai islands, causing a ten-metre-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya region, causing devastation and panic as people remember the huge damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died when buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic abuse charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report from Alaska police, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic assault as well as obstruction of a domestic assault report and resisting arrest in connection with the arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her female companion when she tried to call police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is on remand at the Mat-Su Pretrial detention center and bail has been set at $500, TV station KTUU reported.
The report said Palin appeared in court Saturday and responded that she was "guaranteed innocent."
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, meaning she could face a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
At the time, Palin's mother called police and reported the assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic assault involving possession of a firearm while under the influence of a narcotic.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of punching her in the face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications links are down and the casualty figure is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central state of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos from the moment of the quake are circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing rare death penalty on NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack that claimed eight lives in New York City. It is a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the indictment, Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental car in his Oct. attack on the West Side Highway bike path in south Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and bicyclists.
According to a notice seeking the death penalty in New York's Southern District, capital punishment is possible if prosecutors are able to show that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight of his victims and caused "deliberately" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to carry the death penalty for both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court indicted Saipov on a 22-point charge that included eight counts of murder for aiding a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases related to organized crime. Additionally, the charges included a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation," prosecutors noted, describing the way Saipov carried out his actions as "heinous, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the arraignment notice states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the death penalty was handed down by a court in the southern district of New York.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to serve a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in a federal case in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is an Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He informed investigators his actions felt good, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket in his hospital room.
He responded to the 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty rather than recognition and a life sentence without the possibility of release is a solution that will only prolong the trauma these events have inflicted on those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked that he not be required to face the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged at a rally against the Conservatives today to "mobilise an army of citizens."
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel the pressure from Eurosceptics - after one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Speaking to marchers in Birmingham, Conservative row MP Peter Bone said the UK "would be out by now" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May faces a challenge as she reconciles her deeply divided ranks, underlined by the pro-remain Conservatives who joined a separate anti-Brexit rally in the City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Backers are calling for him to continue his attempts to strike a deal with Brussels despite the setback - and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Mr Bone said at an event at Leave Means Leave in Solihull he wanted to "flip the Chequers proposal to go."
He suggested Mr Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he noted.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm defending Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He voiced his opposition to the EU, saying: "We didn't fight world wars to end up subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone knocked back the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British people have changed their minds and would actually like to stay is a completely incorrect claim."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and neither will the party members nor the activists who really take to the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.'
In a message to Mrs May, he added: "Prime ministers get to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians needed to feel the pressure if they were to reverse the decision made following the 2016 referendum.
This is now about trust between the people and the political class," he stated.
"They are trying to water down Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not accept it."
Addressing an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are intent on rolling back Brexit to have to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilise the army of citizens of this country who gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the UK is an independent, self-governing and proud state again."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying marched across Birmingham ahead of the two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was set up this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's app at the start of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they will get IT systems in order and all the technology for the Canada plus plus arrangement and frictionless border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
'It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considering running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for her repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, in a reelection in November.
Warren is thought to be potentially running against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters since the start of Trump's term.
One attendee asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren responded that now is the time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest seat."
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they have arrested a person of interest in the fatal Friday shooting of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
Police had released a video of the shooting Friday and asked for help identifying the man shown in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot injury to the head and died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday through the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, at which point Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during questioning that he was present, that he was in possession of a firearm and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist when arrested and was taken to East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 6-foot-5 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas overtook Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes" team arrangements are playing an important role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start on pole and left Hamilton almost to his own devices as he defended his place on the first two laps, calling out Vettel on his team-mate.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to ride the tails of the bunch, which should have settled the situation.
Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came back after Vettel, but Hamilton moved past after making some contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inside line, abandoning defending his ranking after two more of his third-turn moves.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in the lead for much of the race as he prolonged a tire change while aiming for a fast finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Raikkonen.
He eventually entered the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase the speed on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a true gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an extraordinary job of achieving the double," Hamilton concluded.
Very bad body language
In a speech Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but noted that what was going on in the Senate was indicative of people's "nasty, viciousness and dishonesty."
"That one possible thing, that wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate the last few days, seeing the anger, the people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see releases and leaked things and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer...did you leak the document – oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we...No, we didn't," he added, sneering at the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations about Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred from her office.
"I did not hide Professor Ford's accusations, nor did I leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban did not sit well with the president, who made the comment at Saturday's event: "Let me tell you, that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.'
The president continued to defend a Supreme Court nominee who has been accused of sexual assault by three women and thought Democrats were using the allegations for their own gain.
"They are determined to get back into power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and viciousness. They don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get into power and govern," Mediaite reports the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sought to make amends for losing Friday's Elite League clash against Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had the early lead thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team level, before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who beat underdogs Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in the season after the Giants won three earlier games.
Dwyer's opener came at 3:35 in the fourth minute off a feed from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford pitched in when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a cagey opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cownies for an equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first period when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team rallied and Bouchard equalized again with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to score the first lead for Dundee at the end of the second period. He also secured the win with his team's fifth goal midway through the final period.
The Giants, who now have lost four of their last five games, will next face Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
Flight director killed making sure hundreds of passengers on board escaped earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia has become a hero after he died making sure a plane carrying hundreds of passengers got off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and several are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami caused by it hit Sulawesi island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are battering the area and several people have been trapped among the collapsed material in the town of Palu.
Although the co-workers escaped with their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed put and made sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the tarmac, got off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower, which he thought might be collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait noted that Agung's decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News broadcast reported.
A helicopter was being prepared from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he passed away this morning before the helicopter made its way back.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, officials fear the death toll will grow into the thousands because the country's disaster authorities have indicated links to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are incomplete.
"The death toll is still believed to be rising because several bodies have been buried in the rubble and many people have not been reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo.
Waves up to six metres have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes are bringing aid and equipment to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old housewife, told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, Indonesia director of the International Red Cross, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it could turn out to be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on the Return Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask all of you to work day and night to get all the evacuation-related tasks done.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline of the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now say one person is missing, although an earlier announcement said all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
As of Saturday afternoon, Air Niugin said it has not been able to locate one male passenger.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane slammed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people remained hospitalized Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the tarmac.
Some witnesses thought the plane had drifted over the tarmac.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes noted.
Jaynes said passengers were able to wade in the sinking plane in waist-deep water to emergency exits.
He said the passenger staff panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors repairing a nearby dock participated in the rescue by ferrying people to shore in a rubber dinghy before the aircraft sank in water about 30 meters (hundred feet) deep.
Aviation Safety Network data shows 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been linked to the crashes.
Analyst lays out timeline for night woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday, in part, completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used data stored on a mobile phone to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was in violation of his earlier claims to be in Chambers' company the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers' house at the same time Tellis claimed to have been in the company of his friend Michael Sanford, Sanford was questioned by police.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town on the day in question.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car on the night in question, Sanford replied that Tellis was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on information stored on their mobile phones, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls and contacts from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
Closing arguments in the defense are scheduled to begin Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge negative perceptions of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have had a chance to witness the UK's resurgence with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another dark one?!
New York nanny sues couple over racist text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "another dark-skinned person."
The couple deny they are racists and equate the challenge to "extortion."
Mother-of-two Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her annoyance when new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day on the job in 2016 and it dawned on her that she was dark-skinned.
"EIIIIIIII, AGAIN DARKHOOD," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But then, instead of her husband, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice.
Plasco-Flaxman, troubled by the mistake she had made, had fired Maurice, according to the New York Post, announcing that their previous send-off African-American nanny had mismanaged her job and she had expected a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home in a taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the separation and wants compensation of $350 a day for the six months he was originally signed up to live and work in the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them you can't do that kind of thing," he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to the racist claims, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a justifiable solution because they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him things he wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your child with someone you've been unkind to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?""
Plasco equated the challenge to blackmail and I said his wife had had the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are we going to start chasing someone else in a situation like this?
It's not very nicely done," the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, trumping their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared public wouldn't identify with talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born a short time after the book was approved, says of the letter: "It's hard to empathise with the position of someone who read a book for the first time before publication.
It's amusing now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.'
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before dedicating himself to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about abandoning his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books felt bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington was "described by him as a very important family member" and noted that his father was quietly proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was quite a quiet man, and not a swaggering type at all," his daughter notes.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one that you are proud of, even though it is not really of your own making.
I think that's how he experienced the success of Paddington.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone
Her daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling me and telling me the situation was really bad, that he wasn't expected to make it," says Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called and said my daughter was going to die in a couple of minutes and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
And I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you.'
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart going gradually disappeared from his system.
He had died a little earlier and now everything shut down.
I could just sit there, knowing it was all coming to an end.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to hold myself together.'
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who is grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane among other passengers - who knew nothing of the ordeal she was currently going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt huge sympathy for Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number where you can get support.
Davis' son Tyler developed depression when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I wouldn't want any parent to have to go through the emotions that I do every day," she noted.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile lights up the whole room."
But he quit his job before his death because he felt he was "in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old younger brother found his brother had taken his own life.
Davis says he's constantly afraid of the after-effects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk.'
Humphreys has been friends with Davies for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behaviour.
'He was absolutely down on Christmas Day. When the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that.'
She notes Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, yet they must cope going forward: "It breaks up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we've just got to get on with life and fight on.'
If you're struggling to cope, you can call Samaritans for free on 116 123 (in the UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org or visit the website.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI launches investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get what he was hoping for - a limited investigation in time and scope - we might be able to get a little bit of unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" over the impasse caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is all about timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans" success is weak as expected, their quest to get the man they want elected to the nation's highest court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Bush and met through him with his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the whistle on the game and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors falls under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of people defecting to South Korea from North Korea has dwindled since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defections last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said crucial factors have included tighter border controls between North Korea and China and price increases for people smugglers.
There has been no public comment on Pyongyang.
Most of the North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul notes that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most escape through China because it shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and, more often than not, forcibly repatriates them.
Still technically at war, relations between North and South Korea have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on stalled talks on dismantling the nuclear arms race.
This followed a historic June meeting at which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un met in Singapore and agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho slammed the United States for sticking sanctions in place after the meeting.
"Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances we will by no means begin to unilaterally dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and unfit to serve on Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called "hysterical,"" Pelosi noted of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was overcome with emotion and at times nearly screamed and lost the ability to speak as he recounted his family and high school years.
He also clearly denounced the committee's Democratic members, without calling the accusations against themselves "grotesque and methodical personal persecution" orchestrated by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential loss.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was not capable of serving on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased toward Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi concluded.
Pelosi wondered when asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"Let's put it this way - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court where he currently works," Pelosi responded.
Kavanaugh currently works for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential provisions for health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
In hearings related to his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not an appropriate moment for a hysterical and partisan person to be elected as a member of the court and for us to be expected to find that that's wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with everything.
It's a legitimate incendiary speech after months and years of rancour over it, and he can't make it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I was helped enormously by a woman who was in a leadership position somewhere and who told me that she cried when she got angry too, but that she had developed a way of saying to her speaking partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying:"You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I’m really angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought that was genius.'
Tears gain legitimacy as a route for rage to erupt, though they tend to be fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories I have of my early employment in a male-dominated office is when I once cried speechless with rage and an older woman - a cold-tempered supervisor I'd always been a bit afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me up a flight of stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
'They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they made you feel bad."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and forced out of the race, a highly frustrated Schroeder figured there was no reason he wouldn't run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," he noted to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least we needed was one more.
Someone called the situation 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
Because the campaign period was long gone, he was behind on fundraising and so he announced he wouldn't enter the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his backers, who gave the male candidates $1,000, gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm going to get something discounted?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not be launching a formal campaign, he became overcome with his emotions - gratitude to his backers, frustration with a system that made it so difficult to raise funds for electioneering aimed at voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that he was unable to speak out.
"You might have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls of press reactions.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking my headstone must be being beaten for an obituary
“She was crying.”
How the U.S.-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The trigger for the US-China trade war was deafening and while the battle is far from over, the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's most important export articles, which include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods to the tune of $200bn (£150bn), effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has responded in kind each time, most recently imposing five to ten percent tariffs on $60 billion worth of American imports.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-for-an-eye fashion, and it does not appear that the world's second-largest economic power is letting up for a moment.
To persuade Washington to back down, you would have to give in to your own demands, but a public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But experts note that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. trade war could have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing dependence between the two countries.
"A quick policy decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start an economic downward spiral in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous prospect than onlookers have so far realized," said Abigail Grace, a research associate in Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria's foreign minister says the country is "ready" for refugees to return
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation is now more stable and more secure thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he noted.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions now make it possible for refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures taken against their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people in need of humanitarian assistance remain in the country.
Al-Moualem noted that the Syrian government would be grateful for help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National course outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six in a row in Europe. It hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself as its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had trouble for nearly the entire tournament and hit his starting shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italy's Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournaments were started in their current form in 1979.
America's Jordan Spieth was forced out with a score of 5&4 against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, ranked as the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time winningest European with a total of 25.5 career points.
'I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get this win.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could be of help," said a moved Garcia after the European team's win.
He will pass the torch to compatriot Jon Rahm, who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual competitions on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride after beating Tiger Woods. I grew up admiring him," the 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Weird stats from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 majors and remains second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding fairways all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose play was of a high standard throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the captain of the U.S. team, stated after his force's failed performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put pressure on the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Credit to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
Gotta take off my hat.
We met our winners.”
