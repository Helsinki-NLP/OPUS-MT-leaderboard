28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
Only recently, a 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he did not know of anyone who wanted to harm his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Forensic Science Agency said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told broadcaster ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters restaurant said the death was a shock to them all.
"We are a small and tight-knit team, like a family. Our regret is great," the rep says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told station KGO.
Louis Galicia says he knew of no one who wanted to harm his younger brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
Her way of being together with family was cooking for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into an argument with anyone.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices going on in the world, she was an uncut diamond who shone every day," he says.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip line at 415-575-4444.
Strike-hit junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of Britain's junior doctors (mostly those who specialise in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for further industrial action in a dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), part of the British Medical Association (BMA), is to ask its entire board for support for further industrial action from early September.
The JDC said ministers had not resolved the problems with the deal.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the deal with the BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chair of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter to JDC members on Twitter on Thursday night in which she says the government has "relentlessly kept quiet" about the issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC Board, in its vote, has rejected a whole new proposal for a contract and demands that new formal negotiations be held on all our concerns.
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government seeking permission for incremental widening industrial action from early September."
The controversy has already seen junior doctors go on strike six times this year, which included the first complete work stoppages ever seen in the history of Britain's public health system.
Johann Malawina, head of junior doctors at the BMA, resigned after the vote, saying he did not accept negotiated contract terms that the BMA had recommended.
Speaking to BMA members during pre-vote meetings, Malawina said the deal was good and should be approved. The vote was attended by 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to shake hands in reconciliation and bring to an official end an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, as Vladimir Putin took on his Turkish counterpart in the Golden Hall of his St Petersburg palace, I had the clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation lay with Ankara.
The two sides shook hands,
but Putin's smile looked thin and little of him oozed warmth even by his own reserved standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, by contrast, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin – five times, according to one report.
I couldn’t count myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness emanating from Putin showed that the Russian head has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the incident was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara with harsh words and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media waged a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, though, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of it all.
Among the most serious were accusations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has profited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has emphatically denied the accusations.
But the official message from St Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only arranged so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also a financial motive for reconciliation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as normally several million Russian tourists travel to Turkish shores each year.
That number has plummeted by nearly 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely breathe a sigh of relief when air traffic can eventually resume.
They put their faith in a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And as recently as this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall once Turkey's agricultural imports are allowed to resume.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was the wording of an article in the financial magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a lacklustre response to the coup attempt.
Not forgetting the old resentment over the snail-paced Turkish EU accession talks and Putin's interference. Putin's eager to capitalize on cool relations and erode Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it voiced its support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own inveterate preoccupation with the transition of power.
Thus, at their summit in a flamboyant seaside palace, Russia and Turkey could convey an image described by one analyst as an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel they have been abandoned and mistreated by the West are joining forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has carved out an image of itself as a peace-builder but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It says much that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, each president told a press conference that they had not touched on the subject at all.
Turkey's president deliberately refused to answer a question about the two countries' differences, while Putin in turn highlighted them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where they might seek consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a full-blown disaster caused by Nato member Turkey shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are even on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
The RBS chief executive said the bank's operations outside Scotland would be curtailed so that it would in future provide only business services, or back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told broadcaster BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank was forced to backtrack from its targets when it all but collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.
In that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors international sport for millions of pounds, with examples including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been deemed right to let more national brands into the foreground.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers but will not be abbreviated as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWests, with the exception of head office and stock market listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also other smaller private banking brands that will be given greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS will become an investment brand and the one that our staff are employed by because we are now becoming much more of a bank of different brands.
Because the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our people work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced it is ending its sponsorship of Six Nations rugby, and it has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time for us to move into a bank with different brands because the bottom line is how are we going to be able to make the bank better for customers," says the bank's chief executive.
"It would have been very scathing three years ago if we had said we were going to be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and our focus on customer needs rather than our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Prediction to victory at Newmarket to claim his 3,000th victory
Dettori sprays champagne after winning two in a row at Newmarket, which marked his 3,000th victory.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night at his own local track. Predilection is a John Gosden-trained horse.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races to be run on a flat track.
Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson have all been named.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says: "This is special.
My emotions are running high because my family is here as well.
I'm very happy that this happened in Newmarket because this is exactly where I ended up 30 years ago.
It's not a big competitive event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a perfectly ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-strong crowd.
I'm relieved and I feel a great sense of humility.'
Dettori takes cheers with Prediction after his win
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in barrier racing, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time and it is no surprise that it was he who reached this milestone that few have reached.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart.
He's a fantastic representative for race riding, his enthusiasm and pruning has brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he would have won 6,000 races by now if he wasn't only competing on weekends and only in the big races!
Seriously though, Frankie's riding career at Great Britain has been a triumphant one for almost 30 years, which has been awesome to watch.
He's a lively personality, which is good for British racing, but most of all he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori vented his achievement in his signature way by flightily jumping off his horse.
"From flying finishers to flying downhills, Frankie Dettori has been a model for British racing for two decades.
The journey has had its ups and downs.
Not only has he won numerous big races, including his famous win at Ascot in 1996"s Magnificent Seven, but he has survived a plane crash and been banned for drug abuse.
When his ban ended three years ago, he had trouble getting started at first, but he showed admirable strength of character, looked to his doubters and returned to his best.
And he won’t be quitting for a while – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing at least until he’s 50.”
Putin sacks administrative chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly dismissed his chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's confidant inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed special representative for environment and transport.
A statement issued by the Kremlin said President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but the reasons for the dismissal were not disclosed.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy chief since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the presidential protocol department and the Cabinet Office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language Web site.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in these words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and overseeing how the instructions you give are implemented."
Speaking to a Russian broadcaster on Friday, Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to resign and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin shown by Russian state television, each said Ivanov was withdrawing from the job at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince few, especially in the run-up to such a parliamentary election.
Are the firings the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
In Russia, the official claim that a man hailed as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policies has been met with great suspicion.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, in which he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me responsibility for this highly complex and to some extent even inconvenient task for four years.
Now I've served as the president's chief of administration for four years and eight months.'
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of Russia's Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the state security service, the KGB.
When Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become Russia's president after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected to a third term.
But the task went to another one close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, then returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
"Criminal Minds" star Thomas Gibson fired after punching producer
Gibson was involved in a violent altercation on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which are producing the show, announced the firings in a joint announcement.
Gibson, known as special agent Aaron Hotchner on the show, had issued an apology Thursday before his termination was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I regret that this happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released at a later date, according to a press release from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," says Gibson in a statement on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the series through to the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and most importantly, the best fans the show could ever have hoped for.”
Season 12 will premiere in the US on September 28.
Mysterious stranding of fish in Banff garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are sandeels that have been sucked onto land by the cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seafront, released footage of the sight in Periscope and hoped to have an answer to the emergence of these five-centimetre fish.
Queensferry overpass now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck and land bridge of the Queensferry overpass, meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "deck fans," which are now almost complete around the bridge's three columns.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slant wires.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for the economy, visited the site today and was one of the first to be able to walk from the land to the bridge.
Mr Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a really significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, and more than 30,000 pieces of concrete and steel have been used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Nearly 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the remainder of the deck is getting its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a major urinal in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the pinnacle of the road and civil engineering sector.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the North Tower post, we then had to close the remaining northbound (i.e., landbound) gap.
This was done by pulling the northbound viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.
This was a massive and at the same time very precise operation.
Massive because the viaduct measures 222 metres in length and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an inclination of about 3 per cent.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the team had to comply with were very small – only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay emergency services say three men miraculously rescued
The three men, who were stranded in the water off Anglesey from their fishing boat, were miraculously rescued.
Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station raised the alarm at 1.20pm local time on Friday after its crew spotted the accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the waters, strong winds had thankfully carried the boat to a distance from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third, aged in his 60s, was found exhausted clinging to a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up by a coastal lifeboat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It's a miracle that these three men who were submerged in the water are still alive and completely fine.
The boat's engine had an emergency fire cord, but for some reason it had come loose from the man driving the boat when it capsized.
They were really lucky in their journey."
Pokémon Go hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have lamented why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and on the move.
Originally, screen time was taken up only by watching TV, then, in addition, came video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and exercise are not mutually exclusive.
Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made into a cartoon series, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this one lobbed a little before the new game became available in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to huge interest that overwhelmed servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go overtook Tinder and was nearly as high as Twitter.
So how does the game work?
Briefly explained, players go out in search of Pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked using GPS. When a Pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using a screen shot of the phone) or "hijacked."
The craze has captivated a generation who played the video game when they were younger and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the US, the game has significantly increased the number of steps an "average person" takes in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported, from the Cardiogram app for the Apple Watch smartwatch, that found within two days of the game's launch that the number of people moving for 30 minutes a day rose abruptly from 45 percent to 53 percent. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company does not know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the exercise amounts.
Many public health campaigns encouraging people to get off the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health benefits – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
It is even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon includes frowning frolics.
And yes, someone can walk into a door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough has been made.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit might have already tracked your activity in the past, they didn't give you a reason to get going, as Pokémon Go does.
The allure of novelty will disappear, and usage will decline in time.
But thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, boosting the physical activity of people going on the hunt and improving their fitness and health.

Simone Biles captures gold in women's rack gymnastics multiple
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless on the boom.
Jaw-dropping perm.
Great at everything.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
The American 19-year-old scaffolder won the all-around title on Thursday and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well ahead of silver-seeded "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performs on the boom during the women's scaffolding individual multi-sport final Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American woman ever to win the all-around title. In doing so, she cemented her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as her overall final score came into view and her long road to this moment came to an end.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new heights and puts him in the same category as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been utterly superior to her sport for the past three years. She has won 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, and earned them with programs so ambitious and precise that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest scaffolder of all time."
There was one final race left in Brazil, between Biles and herself, above all, and the burden of outsized expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, for less than a handful of gold medals would be viewed as a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States (left) and Aly Raisman hug after winning gold and silver in the women's scaffolding individual multiple sculls final Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal Tuesday as if to dot the i's for the send-off of Martha Karolyi, who coordinated the national team and is now retiring.
While Biles claimed to have never thought anything in advance while at the top for a long time, that is not entirely true.
Part of his perm program – which includes a set of somersaults known as his trump card – has been adapted into Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside Rio's Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Having been adopted by her grandparents when she was little and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerhouse. Boorman found the girl when she was on a day-care get-acquainted trip to the gymnasium where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-fight contest since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite getting into a small lead with two twists, Mustafina was like a mirage.
Remaining were the boom and perm, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the outcome with 15.933 points from the perm.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score – a mere formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’s red, white and blue glittering cropping color as the dream she once wrote in her scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch of the race of four years ago when she first shared third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a re-run.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "grannies," was well ahead of Mustafina.
He sent flying kisses to the audience after his perm show, thus emerging from a losing position to a winner, which at times seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, the tweet this 19-year-old made earlier in the week and widely circulated now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three people who listened to music in car were victims of serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest massacre in 10 years. The victims were sitting chatting in a car and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police release issued Thursday.
Authorities say that on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were shot in a car parked on the side of the street.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, from where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, the statement says.
Police suspect the triple slaying may not have been caused by the robbery because the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 found in the possession of the other adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard says police are now investigating whether the killing is linked to four earlier attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, mostly in Hispanic-populated areas, in the past four months.
"What the events have in common is that they have occurred in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told television and radio broadcaster CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died instantly at the scene.
A witness told police the trio had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, police issued a bulletin reporting a shooting at an empty pickup truck just a half-hour before the triple slaying. The shooter in each case is believed to be the same.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered a bullet from the car seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: 'Things are getting better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital small-headedness, caused by a genetic disorder in his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, that he was unaware of while pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was, "I'm not going to make it through this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognise them and might not live at all.
Some of the doctors went as far as to suggest placing the child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think such a practice existed at all anymore," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund sat up and didn't start crawling until he was 3, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly going at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth shows off a sign invented by Edmund, by which he means "sing for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But that doesn't just mean regular sign language; it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different diseases: hereditary, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
The symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to estimate how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
“I kept saying, ‘What will happen to us?’
How are we going.”
And he still doesn't know.
"It's been a long time since I've asked for a prognosis. I don't think anyone is going to be able to give me one."
But Picciuto has some hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and flooding caused extensive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
Louisiana's governor declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rain and widespread flooding. More rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service says several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi overflowed their banks and are spreading across a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local officials and help is already on its way to flood-affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, says the agency is receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning will remain in effect through Saturday for most of southern Louisiana.
According to a press release issued by the weather service, an additional 76-107 mm of water may come to the area.
A flash flood warning was issued for southern Alabama on Friday as rains continued to fall in the Mobile region.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each in Louisiana, are forecast to reach record highs.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said many houses along rivers could be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says, flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as overflowing rivers slowly empty into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi state line, had reached higher than ever by 9am on Friday.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek River, which normally is more than 120 feet from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We got up, and water was coming in on a constant feed," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
His wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says she and her family members all have disabilities, and she herself is the only one able to swim.
Rescuers had rescued all three in a large army-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held cover on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the flooding will quickly spread widely as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports information from an observer near Livingston that nearly 350mm of rain had fallen between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil has become heavily wet since the rains began Wednesday.
Authorities say heavy rains and street flooding forced Tangipahoa County residents to be rescued from their homes and school classes to be canceled in five school districts.
A Tangipahoa city council member had told television and radio broadcaster CBS affiliate WWL that 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
County Executive Robby Miller says authorities have rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the flood.
Shelters have been opened for evacuees in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to recede," he says.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed because of the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to keep water from reaching their homes and businesses.
"The last time we experienced a major flood was in March," says Lacy Landrum, a city board member.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, rains continued to fall flat along the Gulf of Mexico coast, according to Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy says there were reports of a handful of flooded houses on Thursday, but as of Friday none had been reported so far.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it keeps raining more and more."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received multiple bullets to his body, survives Philadelphia shooting
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents said the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, shin, arm and abdomen but was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was riddled with bullets," Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother, told the broadcaster.
"I can't believe it."
The boy is in a critical condition in hospital, undergoing several operations.
The family tells the broadcaster that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted in the shooting.
One of the 29-year-olds was reported to be in critical condition and the other two were in stable condition, reports CBS Philadelphia.
The broadcaster said the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was littered with assault weapons-type shell casings, which come from a variety of assault weapons.
"It is absolutely clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the pavement on the street.
There have been a number of armed fighters on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was hit by a stray bullet while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane section of the city on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and police are still searching for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's scaffolding Olympic team, and there are more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been as overwhelmed as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have excited many girls of color.
The lineup of the team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latinx women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female scaffolder has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked Nos. 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances and surprising and masterful scaffolding programs of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simone on Thursday became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
Teammate Aly Raisman, meanwhile, won silver.
The outlook is like this at the top of the sport, but it doesn't look the same in scaffolding classes nationwide.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic team in rack gymnastics will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karolyi's final year as coach.
The reality, however, is that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts train mainly in private rack gymnastics clubs run by their parents. Parents have to pay for the training costs, facilities, travel, performance outfits, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
The facilities of most scaffolding clubs are located in affluent residential areas capable of supporting activities.
The teaching of scaffolders takes place in these clubs, and represents an expensive and long-term commitment for the families of the gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, the trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have each coached the sport's enthusiasts since they started rack gymnastics.
We need to provide more affordable and accessible gymnastics education for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been sparked by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have provided free or low-cost access to scaffolding for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly Black and Hispanic), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality scaffolding for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Rack gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm from thousands of young girls who now want to start scaffolding, and it's just amazing.
Participation in any sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the true "girl power" you showed in winning Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls from diverse backgrounds to begin their path to becoming well, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for more strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by approving a revised contract with the British Medical Association (BMA), the trade union representing doctors, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, who took part in the vote, rejected the proposal.
Announcing plans to force a deal in July, Health Secretary Mr Hunt said Britain's public health system (NHS) was in "no man's land" and that any further delay would be damaging to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve health care at antisocial times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors committee, issued a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors remain highly reserved about the proposed deal. There is a particular fear that it will precipitate the current workforce crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It's only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred under the new contract, so we need to get on with it now, as time is running out.
The BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking out, but the government has taken a reluctant and sometimes even unresponsive approach to attempts to debate.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, overturn the implementation of the contract and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this doesn't happen, junior doctors will be ready for further industrial action.'
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultant doctors were asked to support the striking doctors in a picket.
Ministers hoped to end the row over the changes by striking a renewed deal with staff members of the trade union that represents Britain's doctors.
The trade union BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the deal.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Workers, appealed to junior doctors not to go on further strikes.
Mr Mortimer says: "Labour action achieves very little or nothing, but it puts pressure on teams and services already operating at the limit and causes concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the past two months we have been in consultation with the Junior Medical Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the supervisor's role and the disclosure of grievances.
Employees were hopeful that continued positive engagement on other important topics – such as development, training flexibility, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and the gender pay gap in the care sector – were a sign of how seriously employees, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Department of Health want to uphold the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May."
A drug costing around £2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are being given access to the drug, which costs around €2.40 a day, after officials recommended it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of further heart attacks in heart disease patients.
The drug is already being given 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), part of the UK's public health system (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new treatment methods, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), part of Britain's public health system (NHS) and assessing the introduction of new methods of treatment, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England have a heart attack each year, with a quarter having a heart attack come back or having a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material building up in the walls of blood vessels, which generates plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can create a blood clot that prevents blood from reaching the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if a blood clot breaks loose, it can travel with the blood supply and block blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Ticagrelor, made by Britain's AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces that risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
Today's draft NICE guidance recommends that ticagrelor should be given for the next 90mg for 12 months, then reduced to 60mg, plus aspirin twice a day for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, of the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Adoption (NICE), says: "Although effective methods of treatment are available to effectively prevent disease progression and the onset of symptoms, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation to temporarily use ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who will benefit from it."
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Because of the climate that fosters political correctness, voter fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was suspended last year for corruption, resulting in a government debrief
The climate of political correctness has turned a blind eye to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities, a government report revealed today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former government minister, harshly criticised police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to electoral fraud "because of hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Mr Pickles, known as a former regional administration minister and current anti-corruption powerhouse, said voter intimidation on religious grounds was so bad that police should have had permission to form guard chains outside polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests voters should present identification to be able to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, voters only need to give their name and address.
In addition, the report suggests dipping your fingers in indelible ink after voting to prevent anyone from being able to vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric
He is calling for better access for journalists to Government documents and the decisions of informal boards and working groups.
"The purpose is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favors them more broadly in local governments," he says.
Britain's prime minister asked for a briefing after the Tower Hamlet vote scandal in east London.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should resign because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The tribunal ruled that Rahman "blatantly distorted" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was said to be "using as the basis of his campaign the fact that it was the religious duty of every Muslim of faith to vote for him."
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or cast fraudulently in such a way that the person voted by pretending to be some other person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail-in election fraud, with senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressuring people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made a number of proposals to tidy up the voting system, including requiring ID at a polling station
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members. This was particularly the case in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin."
"There was concern that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such activities due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to tidy up the system, including banning the processing of postal ballot papers by political activists, in order to prevent "vote harvesting."
The report currently under review by Theresa May also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of alternatives where voters would be required to present identification before voting.
Dip your fingers in indelible ink after voting so that no one is able to vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure voters' nationality and voting rights.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic mail-in voting.
A ban on the processing of completed mail-in ballots and mail-in envelopes for political activists.
The right for police to form guard chains around polling stations.
Changing the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the Representation of the People Act, which was passed in 1983 to expand voting rights.
Ban photography at polling stations.
Only English allowed at polling stations (excluding Wales).
Stepping up training to ensure staff enforce the rule that only one person at a time is allowed in the polling booth.
Sir Eric is fiercely critical of London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The electoral court suspended Lutfur Rahman and his representatives because of corruption and numerous illegal procedures," he says.
"He was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised ineffective "ticking checks" by the departments responsible for the city council's electoral roll.
"The court's ruling last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud in some quarters and its denial."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers savage Rio Olympics
Rio 2016 Olympic fans went wild this week for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is uncanny.
But according to conversations on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the title with a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic delegates whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the United States men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on cycling tracks, many people have noted on social media how one archer could be the twin brother of actor favourite Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison of the United States men's archery team caused a storm after photos of him posted on Twitter bore a startling resemblance to the star of the Wolf of Wall Street film.
Ellison was aware of the buzz on social media and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he resembles DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the resemblance as that great, maybe apart from the beard and mustache," said Brady to the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
The London Games in 2012 were all about the resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will no doubt be brought out even more in these Games.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been dubbed the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the swim lanes, meanwhile, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, known for the Glee TV series, for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the actor in Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, highlighted by their respective powerful eyebrows and lips, has long been noted.
Swimming's silver medallist, Russia's Yulia Efimova is reminiscent of actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while the US team's Nathan Adrian is described by his fans as "an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
These two iron women, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if there's a good reason for the pair's resemblance.
One tweeter recently expressed delight that "others on the internet also agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American football star and the Dexter actor really do bear a startling resemblance to each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also spotted resemblances in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union, the gold-winning gymnast and star of "Let's Go!"
CBC Olympics commentator apologises after saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish in the women's 4 x 200m freestyle relay stunned viewers of the CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologise after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smell" and "died like a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started firing off his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to bring colour, was heard saying: "This little 14-year-old of yours laid a Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he took off fast and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79, trailing by 1.61 seconds over Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did a CBC commentator just say a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realise he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan, a Chinese swimmer in the final of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious comments critical of Byron MacDonald, with many calling for his dismissal.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how uncaring Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist bunch. #repugnant."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, was quick to say sorry for what MacDonald said: "We apologise for the comment made about the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry that this happened.'
The CBC eventually had to apologise more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Fellow commentator Scott Russel had to offer regrets on Mr MacDonald's behalf.
The CBC then copied and glued its regrets to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about what MacDonald had said.
The broadcaster was also quick to issue a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry, for these statements and for making it on the air.
We quickly apologised to our viewers on air last night, and we also issued an apology to our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is extremely sorry for what he said."
On Thursday night, MacDonald offered his regrets on air and tried to excuse what he said by saying he didn't mean it to be personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay swim," MacDonald said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn't mean anything derogatory by my words, and I'm very sorry.'
Woman who fitted underwear uninhibited in Primark amid shop upsets customers
Customers didn't know where to look as the woman undressed in the middle of Primark to match the knickers.
He made things worse still by assessing how he looked in the underpants, took them off his leg and placed them back on the shelf.
She continued to gyrate and eventually tried on four pairs of knickers at a shop in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark chain store in Folkestone's Bouverie Place shopping centre where a woman tried on knickers in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
She says of what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her knickers off the shelf, took off her own tights and knickers and put them on.
He didn't try to do it discreetly, he did it completely unashamedly.
Everyone stared as she took her tried-on knickers off, apparently not liking them because she placed them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like any of them, getting dressed and walking out.
He didn’t seem to mind the looks – and didn’t think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he’d tried on.”
Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues: "How disgusting to think of someone taking home knickers that someone else has worn and not been washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"It is my understanding that the store staff sought to remove those items of clothing from sale once the woman had left – which is correct.
It would be terrible to take your new underpants home and find that someone else has tried them on without having washed them since," adds Davidson.
A spokesman for Primark commented by saying: "Primark is aware of a situation that occurred at its Folkestone store on Tuesday 9 August.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is fraught with danger, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser brandishing a gun at close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or the back.
If an attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get out of the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so it stays between your elbow and upper arm, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the assailant in the groin with your knee, and when he goes double over in pain, slap him on the face with the barrel of the gun and back away by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest with your fist. Turn the gun out of the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun pointed at the attacker.
Sounds tricky?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
However, remember that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash – unless you’re a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Travel guide-making world traveller Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest spots
The British world traveler put his resistance and gagging reflex to a severe test by licking some of the dirtiest and most obnoxious places in Europe.
Suffolk presenter and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking a euro banknote, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button in the train toilet and a Russian public telephone.
Before licking, Wright measured the targets with a luminometer to see for himself and show viewers where he was sticking his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright – Following the Inner Force, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train toilet can be sickening, but in fact more germs are in the kitchen sink.
On his trip across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening the good bacteria in the gut and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything other than a foul-tasting mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel show, in which he tested the endurance of his bowels by travelling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Licking the handrails and toilet flush button at railway stations no doubt challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: "Ever since I was a kid, I've been pretty carefree about my health and put all sorts of stuff in my mouth, like dirt, worms and curvy water."
In the film, he really showed himself to be equal to his reputation.
The border came only in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units in the sample.
For comparison, in newly washed hands, the number is usually less than 60.
The border came across in a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units – in freshly washed hands the same figure is less than 60.
In the documentary Ian Wright – Inside the Force, which was produced in collaboration with Valio, Wright explores how bacteria can be detected in different places, such as in the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: "This is just about the most horrible smell I've ever smelled in any toilet.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here at all.'
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright – Following the Inner Force in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio, Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut's good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager for Valio’s snack, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to watch and at the same time tells you about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time coming up with ideas for something crazy, and eventually we came up with the idea of asking Ian to come along."
Gut health has become a global trend.
"Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Gut health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie is also about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds here: "Let's put it this way, I would have lost respect for Ian if he'd licked certain items we'd asked for, like the sickening Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we were able to capture some of the dirty licks on tape.'
In Valio’s 2015 survey, 84 per cent of the respondents linked lactic acid bacteria especially to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent said that they had used products with added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A family of disorderly people destroyed a city-owned tenement in Saltash, Cornwall, before their eviction
A disorderly family left behind £50,000 worth of damage to a city-owned tenement after they were evicted for terrorising the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their flat in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple was forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company noted with shock that the apartment was in renovation condition.
There were gaping holes in the walls, floorboards had been ripped out, debris was strewn on the floors and the walls were smeared with graffiti.
The couple have now moved in, and are believed to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the flat may no longer be able to be saved.
He says: "This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with something like this.
There is a lot to weigh up as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. Police said the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and transmission, and loud wailing, arguing and swearing.
Mr Skeldon, 47, who signed the lease, was given an anti-social behaviour order in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under threat of demolition.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floorboards had been ripped out.
Neighbours said the family fought in the street and police had to be regularly called.
The couple were forcibly evicted by the Cornwall Housing Authority this week after first giving them an extra 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction – they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbours says: "They didn't care about anyone.
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
'This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It's going to be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted.'
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of enforcement at Cornwall Housing Authority, says the family was unable to co-operate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Rubbish and old toys had been dumped on the wild wall of the tenement.
Mr Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and that of his family, as eviction is always the last action considered by the Cornwall Housing Authority.
This incident was extremely difficult as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been shocking viewing for the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my taskforce, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who took part in the work and bravely offered to provide us with information.
I hope this step forward will improve the wellbeing of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick says the family's three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one of house's bedrooms after eviction
Housing workers will now have to clean up the piles of waste surrounding the house.
Police raided the flat in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis plus scales and other paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possessing the Class B drug with intent to sell.
He claimed the money was for the headstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, Ms Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved into a private flat in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were scrawled with graffiti.
Police say they will demand eviction for tenants who break the rules of the leases.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who continually flout the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave however they want without being charged, as well as those who are subjected to such behaviour," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, and will continue to work with its partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-swept army jet scares tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers suffered the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft crashed at a mind-boggling low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
A picture shows the moment tourists were panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show the military plane coming within near-contact of tourists sunbathing on a sandy beach in northern Portugal's Aveiro.
Holidaymakers rose to their feet as they worried understandably about the roar of the jet's engines, which began to be heard before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the holidaymakers who filmed the dramatic flyby and posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment where it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane was going to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach suffered a shock when a plane suddenly came into view and flew at a mind-boggling low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training mission to identify fishing vessels off the coast, which is why the plane had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke from nearby wildfires was obstructing visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Wildfires have wreaked havoc in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to heavy fog and poor visibility caused by smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Eksote's first-half profit better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made a better-than-planned profit of EUR 3.4 million in January-June.
Eksote recorded a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where it has been possible to dismantle institutional care by developing preventive services.
The treatment was carried out in all activities.
Eksote aims to reduce the number of procedures this year.
Exote covers the deficit created by the surplus in the past.
Any excess of that will perhaps be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote's board will consider the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Borders Officers Sworn In At Immola
The 70 conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School were sworn in as soldiers on Friday.
The military swearing-in of conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School took place in Immola on Friday.
The swearing-in of the tenth Special Borders Jaeger course took place at the garrison's sports ground.
Seventy conscripts took the military oath.
Special border guards are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become special border guards.
250 of them were invited.
Special border guards have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veterans' meeting at the time of the swearing-in included five veterans of the wartime Frontier Corps.
The average age of those involved is now 90.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
Somewhat ahead of the bandit - crime intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has operated an RTA (Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit).
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
In the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is run by a sergeant stationed in the bay.
The officer in charge is a lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the unit’s strength includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in plainclothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has obtained information on asylum seekers in Häme.
The latest reform of working practices
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, i.e. that the police would less and less often go to the swamps until they received an alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target daily policing where it is needed most.
Along with the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, its three national units and each police department had its own criminal intelligence unit.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre in connection with the Central Bureau of Investigation leads the operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments, and their role is to provide information to both local police forces and national units.
The inquiry extends beyond their own area
Where an individual officer is privy to what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening throughout the Police Department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the confines of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those who work in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
Using registers, an alert task database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, prolific criminals or crimes that resemble one another.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method, a certain image is formed.
This can be done on the basis of either the method or the person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
Workers in the RTA unit don't walk around town with their collars up, but their work isn't entirely public either.
Both their own methods and those used by criminals are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention efforts.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if it anticipates that they pose a threat.
For example, such a case was reported in early summer, the method of marking vacant homes used in residential burglaries.
In it, the makers put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the apartment's front door to test whether residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial material is at least public to the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The cleverest ones order the district court's minutes, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
Assistant Commissioner Tero Seppänen of the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola of the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi of the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela of the Central Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed for the case.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
Against a background of declining workforce and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended in 2013 at the end of the year.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl linked to ISIS killed in Syria
The news comes as one of three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an ISIS stronghold in Syria, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 and, according to her family, was just planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that this will serve as a cautionary example and testament for people to understand this is a real risk when going into a war zone - and one that will dissuade people from deciding to leave," says Akunjee.
Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and continued on to the Syrian border by bus.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he's convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will name Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court justice if he's elected president.
Republican members of the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will pick the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicts Clinton will pick Garland with "quite a high degree of certainty."
A spokesman for Reid later clarified that this was only speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether she would name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" by picking someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "commanders" and "forward helpers" of presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats magazine says nude calendars belong to women as well as men
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s-style and Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, the chief executive of Treats, told me earlier this year that his magazine dripping with nudity was different from old-school Playboy magazines, as he said: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women.'
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity where women, like men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images that glorify the female body," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"I'm sure women will want to take part in this project because it will be a beautiful piece of art."
Those wishing to model for the calendar will be able to submit their photos via the web or take part in open selection sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
The appeal of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write your angry objection in the comments section under the pseudonym EivaAllloneinenMiddle-agedMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, behind the much-talked-about re-emergence of vinyl records, there is no millennial-generation boom when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is a backdrop of midlife nostalgia.
The most likely age for someone who has recently bought a vinyl album is between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
It’s also not just hobbyists who want to buy records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along busy Soho Street, wearing an unadorned grey jacket suit. I would gesturing busily, bending my arms into a cup and saying something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
While Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness as hotels, the Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before facilities owned by private entrepreneurs, a handful of specialty record stores still remain.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I get very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and character by observing.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (as clients at that moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (as clients at that moment eight middle-aged men, one probably a woman in her twenties) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and passes her extra time by exploring the shops" offerings.
I ask if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as you can see from the photo. (Stuart emailed me the picture, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly down to his disposable income. He is now able to buy records he couldn't afford when they first appeared and re-buy things he had been forced to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of late '60s and early '70s stuff that showed up when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to have them," he says.
He agrees that those buying vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who thrive in their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice.'
Wez, 25, who works at the Sister Ray store, also believes many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
But he has discovered a new kind of influx of people who have been affected by the media hype. These people have heard about vinyl records coming out again and are now feeling compelled to buy back their old records.
"Based on the conversations I had, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their vinyl," he says.
This may explain the boom in vinyl wokes of a certain age.
What, then, of the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a shop like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
Wez said some older customers have taken issue with the contactless payment system in particular.
The digital world may overwhelm some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means permanence and reminds them of the happy days of youth.
"I think it's sometimes used to fill some gap or to acquire material possessions for some sort of comfort," says Wez.
"That's how I experience it myself as a collector, and I think so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind elsewhere.'
"We're like social workers!" swoons Wez's co-worker from behind a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April revealed that almost 50% of those who bought a vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to their record.
The poll also reported that 41 percent have a turntable they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers don't have a turntable of their own at all.
At this point in the newscast, I'd probably be showing a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
The resurgence of vinyl records also involves a "trophy phenomenon" spotted by Jonny, 42, a salesman in the Sounds of the Universe movement (with three middle-aged men as customers at the time).
"One customer recently came into the shop and said he doesn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," says Jonny.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but they are.
For them, materialism is more important than music.
Some of our customers tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They're younger, not older, largely in their teens, who are just starting a hobby.'
The customer base is considerably more varied at Fopp, which I arrive at next. The shop has devoted an entire floor to vinyl records.
Clients include couples in their seventies, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Customers' disparity delights, even if the mood isn't as relaxed as in previous moves: booming from the speakers instead of rocking jazz, Wild Beasts' latest sex-dripping synthesizer pop.
None of the clients look particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is hard to establish by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and looking at various records on sale.
He's more of a watcher than a shopper.
He says his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
“They cost a lot.
It's easy to listen to music on your computer or otherwise, but the great thing about booze is ..." he lets out a delighted sigh and continues:
"I can't explain it. They're so unique."
My last stop is the store said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I spot a group of teenage girls who you'd imagine are jumping around in jean shorts, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and daughter who are contemplating buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some so high they can't even be reached.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that any means of getting attention for these records might mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little cause for complaint.
It's no surprise that the demographic most likely to have more time and money than most, while also being the group that spends the most money on luxuries such as vinyl records.
However, while my research suggests YouGov's results are correct, at least in Soho record shops, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or work.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings loitering in Berwick Street record shops, flipping through records and avoiding the 30-year-old playing a television presenter who stares intimidatingly and glancing at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate – video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark in the study ranged from 272 to 412 years, a female measuring five metres in length.
French court rejects application to demolish jungle camp shops
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities seeking the demolition of dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in a jungle camp populated by thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais made arguments that the state should be allowed to break up the 72 makeshift shops set up in the refugee camp. The shops sell a range of goods from tobacco to energy drinks to the people in the refugee camp and offer haircuts. You can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros at the makeshift restaurants.
According to the Calais prefects, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a black economy and because they carry fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as free meals provided by the state-backed organization and others are not enough for the camp's ever-growing population.
They say makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those who need it.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for deporting the 72 temporary shopkeepers but found the Calais prefect's concerns "entirely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants were of far greater importance than simply providing food for people "living in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they provide peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids cafe, which is non-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to the camp's hundreds of unaccompanied minors, whose status is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling for the children's cafe to be preserved.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the jungle camp's population has reached a record high of more than 9,000.
Food prices in Finland are falling faster than the EU average
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the chagrin of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while the average price in EU countries fell by 0.9 per cent.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
During the past three years, the price of food has fallen second most in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels.
Only Britain’s food prices have fallen faster than Finland’s.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Statistics Finland’s Development Manager, which was published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
The leaflet compared real prices, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are for June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food increased sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We came close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then came the turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year after year.
The price is now weighed down by food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stymied food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policies have helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Intensified price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the price decline.
Major retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels as Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the control countries were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the EU average and price competition must continue," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made with the VAT rate are indicative.
School isn’t the same anymore.
Anyone returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change at the school over the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools and will be introduced in all primary schools at the start of term.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools follow.
The details are decided by the schools themselves, but the plan spells out the official goals.
The new guidelines have been in preparation for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of cursive writing will be abandoned, and instead schools will start practicing coding.
Swedish education begins at the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begins at the fourth grade.
But the biggest change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone needs to be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-living vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), also known as the ice shark, does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It could live for another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only overtaken by the Icelandic clam, with the oldest known specimen dated to the age of 507.
Greenland sharks swim across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimeter a year, according to trackers, adult individuals have been forcibly living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females trapped in fishermen's gear.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter Amazonian fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old, respectively.
Because previous studies have found that ice shark females do not reach sexual maturity until they are more than four metres tall, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann sacks nearly 300 - no reduction in sales
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from department store company Stockmann.
Co-operation companies in the troubled company ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It said there would be no reduction in the number of vendors in department stores to ensure customer service was not affected.
In addition, about 80 support function employees will be offered new jobs as salespeople.
Stockmann’s co-operation negotiations involved approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the reduction need was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction in population is aimed at cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million per year, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme that aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
According to Stockmann’s acting CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not reached the targets set by the company.
"Staff reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The profit improvement in the second quarter was mainly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter revenue and earnings.
Lindex operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the operating result of the entire Stockmann Group was a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating results are expected to be slightly positive this year.
It will be rainiest in the north on Friday - with temperatures below 20C across the country
A centre of low pressure on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, a meteorologist at HS.
There will also be showers in central parts of the country, but further south it will be pouty.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as the mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius across the country.
Rainy areas in the north will remain between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius.
Kenyan athletics team rocked by doping scandal has bizarre explanation for coach's stunt
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah posed as an athlete for the national team in a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to impersonate is 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a member of Kenya's national team management, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials turned themselves in to Anzrah officials.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home as he "committed his crime against the Kenyan national team."
He posed as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," Kip Keino, president of the Kenya Olympic Committee, told Reuters.
Olympic athletics begins Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run right away at that time.
It is not yet known if there are any known consequences for the runner as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth at the World Cup last year en route to being the pre-race favourite to win Rio.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team, meanwhile, claimed that Anzrah passed the athlete's accreditation card only to receive free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials for fear of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio's athletics stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
Not at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
Rio launched a battle for athletics medals on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to show off their skills to a bewilderingly empty grandstand.
Rio organisers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of tickets for the first day's morning races and 65 per cent of tickets for the evening races have been sold.
The other was four years ago in London, where the stadium was crammed with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals have already sold out in Rio, too.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
In the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding, for example, thousands of empty benches have been visible.
When Brazil's medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo played Holland against Russia, only about 30 per cent of the 12,000 crowd were full.
The poor sales are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with financial difficulties, is a long way off for European and Asian race tourists, and many Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to soccer.
Although, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to draw the football stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the race organizers, said at the weekend that 82 percent of tickets had been sold at the time, a markedly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, despite tickets costing almost half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about €9 to more than €1,000 for the opening ceremony.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and army personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because organisers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
True, in Rio, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats in Rio's stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Established last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, individuals, companies and communities can redeem their rights to the land with the money.
The foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is divided virtually into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the bearer right for a fee.
The holder will have veto power over its 187-square-foot parcel, which effectively means not every holder will be required to get approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for several blocks.
The acquisition of a right of possession is something concrete that can be passed down as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature,” explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right of possession for his company.
The holder of the right of administration receives precise location information from the block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of those who have acquired rights appear on the same map where the parcel data of the land can be found.
The only risk Leviäkangas sees in its nature conservation acquisition is that the foundation’s operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow act unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of rights of way, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It is also targeting beyond Finland's borders and is planning a land acquisition in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku worst of major cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves are the worst hit of Finland’s major cities.
More bikes have been stolen there this year, in proportion to the population, than in the other nine largest cities.
Based on reported bike thefts, Helsingin Sanomat investigated how many bicycles and their parts per 1,000 inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti came top.
There were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 residents, according to police data.
In contrast, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 residents were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are double the number of thefts compared to others," says Superintendent Tommi Reen of the National Police Board.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is in the top spot in comparison.
It is difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be affected by how much people travel around the city on bikes and how many bikes there are at all," ponders Sgt. Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board thinks it is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will come out on top in the comparison.
The numbers of bike thefts go largely by what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a compact city centre, short distances and plenty of bikes for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts every year.
That’s 50-60 bikes a day, and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"They're big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bike theft, although fewer than one in 10 cases reported to police survive.
A typical cleared bike theft is one where the police are alerted to the theft immediately and the thief is caught red-handed.
"Cases will also be discovered in connection with other investigations, when stolen bikes may be found in an apartment in a drug case, for example," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught on a weekly basis either by the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Constable Timo Leppämäki.
He said bikes are being stolen from places such as shopping malls' bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars, or virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves take a bike for short-term personal use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen bikes end up being sold online, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that a lot of stolen bikes go overseas," Reen says.
The buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns, according to police.
Some people buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may be guilty of a concealment offence or violation.
"Alarm bells should be ringing if a bike in good condition is sold at a markedly underpriced price," says Reen.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He's had five bikes, but none have been stolen, Moose says. "Never been taken, there's been a good monk in that."
"Perhaps this doesn't so much attract thieves, there's not necessarily hipster value in this either," the Helsinki-based Hirvi ponders.
Siiri Valve, who had a quick visit to a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike nudged against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks its bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"I'll think about it quite a bit, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," the Helsinki student says of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"You hear from the guys all the time that bikes have been taken."
"Predominantly bad bikes, such boozy jockeys".
A bicycle was stolen from the house a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve expected to take it.
Under-15s to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to trial peer juries familiar from US
In Helsinki, a so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime.
Initially, the trial will apply to under-15s, who will now be deprived of criminal responsibility.
A peer jury intervenes in the first offence committed by a juvenile.
The idea is for a peer jury to discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender himself can join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and the lessons learned.
The youth leader, Tommi Laitio, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them steer the young person's activities in a more responsible direction so that everything would not be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury is modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after their first offence, will not be confronted by a panel of adults but will reflect on what happened with people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Service designer Iikka Lovio from service design agency Palmu, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first offences committed by under 15-year-olds may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new practices are offered to everyone in need, not just to young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the US newspaper Politico, which had obtained a draft of it to see.
The newspaper said the open letter is aimed at Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
Signatories want party money diverted to congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the divisions caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record-breaking unpopularity, threaten to bring a landslide for Democrats in this election," the letter says, according to Politico.
Only diverting all potential funds immediately to congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-embellished anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are getting smaller by the day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominent anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majorities in Congress" and that it's not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials who worked on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton laid out the details of her economic policies Thursday night.
I'm running for president to make sure the U.S. economy is doing well for everybody.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his cronies," Clinton said in her speech.
At the center of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases on the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a show of hands to American laborers who suffered after factories moved to low-cost labor countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we need to get back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, anyway, he sounded like Sanders in emphasizing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the U.S. as a tax exile, it has to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Trans-Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president], I oppose any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post ahead of Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic agenda announced Monday for "favoring only millionaires like this one."
Trump’s proposed corporate tax cut has been dubbed by Clinton in the past as a “Trump loophole.”
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was herself the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making products in America himself," Clinton chimed in.
Such are Rio's ratings: The Games haven't glued Finns to screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports races appear as sharp mountaintops in television ratings.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the games have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens at best: 615,000 viewers watched Tuesday night's swim from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison, the European Athletics Championships a month ago attracted almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
Of the Olympic sports most interested so far is Sunday night cycling and the scaffolding that opened the fifth day of racing, both of which reached nearly half a million viewers at a time on the Olympic channel.
Head of Yle Sports Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings and reminds that for the first time in the Rio Olympics, spectators will be divided into several different media.
In addition to television, Finns watch the Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the percentage of TV viewers who choose the Olympics at all.
On the television side, too, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics will be the first sports competition to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you're broadcasting 24 hours a day, and you've got 20,000 to 500,000 viewers in all that time, then that's a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - much of Rio's race coverage comes at night in Finland.
Another reason for the lame interest - if anyone now thinks it's lame - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as well as other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
The initial number of spectators has been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics starts, the ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games.
As of Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I bet we're already going around 200,000 downloads now.
"We won't get the ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
The Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been fixed.
There has been a delay and other minor technical issue with the use of the Rio Arena in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been received, which should fix the errors.
The Rio Olympics are more visible on Yle’s canals and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
You can watch some sports on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games on a daily basis.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most arduous ever for Yle, but also the last ones that can only be followed from Yle’s channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be shown both on Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Lake Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres at Ristinselkä.
It might be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found an imprint of about 20 square metres in Ristiselkä, the depth of which was shown by a diving computer to be 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar.
The method does not necessarily find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So for now, the official depth remains at 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to over 80 metres.
They have not been as closely studied as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by the average depth, it is the Great Lake of Juka, 23 meters.
Viewed this way, Päijänne does not make it to the top ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction, August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Fixed the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in average depth were misaligned.
Tax Cut: Tax on Pensioners Continues to Be Tighter
The tax burden on pensioners is still higher than on wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievance was highlighted during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government's proposal does not include such a thing.
We definitely think it should be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to the Western media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received reductions in their income, which reduced taxation.
The issue heated up opposition figures in parliament, who grilled the then finance minister Alexander Stubb (Kok.) about the election promises.
Purchase power is secured, it doesn't grow
According to Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo, Ihalainen’s policy on tax cuts is mainly about securing rather than increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says the tax cut will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things don't add to people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with the messages sent by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Orpo for their desire to honour the hard-won competitiveness agreement.
He says sticking to the deal is important for credibility..
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by the social partners, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It will come in handy because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Prolonged Unemployment in the Middle East
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at the very least to halt its growth.
There were around 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than a year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 per cent will escape.
He warns that if the challenge of persistent unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thai attacks
The bombings in Thailand last night killed at least four people.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season to Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thailand's tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has sought to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in order to obtain information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said there was no word yet on who carried out the attacks.
The ambassador thinks the events may be linked to political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country for declaring their opposition to the law.
Thailand's southernmost provinces, meanwhile, are smouldering with an ethnic-national conflict linked to the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He said the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about security.
Thai police say the attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "localized sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to Thai police, according to the Associated Press.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the past 24 hours as 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in tourist hotspots Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded at night on the resort island of Phuket, according to the Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, wounding one person, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination of Hua Hin yesterday and today, according to local officials.
Both twin bombings killed at least one.
In addition, in southern Thailand, at least one bomb went off in the village of Surat Thani and in the city of Trang each.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is the route to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of Thailand's ruling military junta, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We must not stir people to panic further," he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, who is in charge of security, said at least the attacks in Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
Speaking to Thai BSB, he said the perpetrators have been intent on destroying tourism in the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist resorts.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims.
There has been some time to get a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians are among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they may have found yet another bomb.
The bomb in Surat Thani was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN says two bombs were also used in the attack in Surat Thani, which went off about half an hour apart.
The Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's quadruple sculls
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60.098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with a 58.665-point performance.
Biles, 18, is still going for rack championships at the Rio Games on perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics at will for the past few years.
He won eight individual world championships.
He has won three consecutive doubles and doubles titles last year and last year.
On the U.S. team, Biles has won two team competition world championships.
Dimer World Cup medals Biles has from jump and boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The impact will have no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is unconcerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don’t think anything more will come of it,” says Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen up close many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then bird flu and last year a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't deterred tourists either, I doubt this one will.
The office of the Huovila company is located a few hundred meters away from the blast site.
The hoofer heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says both the boardwalk and the main Bangla Road were completely closed early this morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local employees came into the workplace this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put up for the Queen's birthday," says Huovila, referring to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the mood was calm and shops on the main street were allowed to open at around 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn't even heard of the attacks.
By half past three in the daytime on Patong, traffic had normalised and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the impact site, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila, who visited the impact site, says.
Later, the car was seen on Jouxholmintie in Kruunupyy.
By the time the police got there, the car had been set alight.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby spruce-up.
Another man was immediately taken into custody.
The other ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to a motor vehicle.
Police thank those who provided the tips.
Research director on Russia's leadership changes: Clear relegation
Russia on Friday made its highest-ranking leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin fired his administration chief, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov is succeeded by 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's removal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him amassing too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way to wield power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has clashed with other executives or has messed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special duties in environmental and transport matters.
In a tape aired by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov himself had asked to be reassigned and suggested Persecution to replace him, Russia Today reported.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view it is a clear positional drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not high on Russia’s agenda.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s seat that Putin changes his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to the town of Jarabulus so we would not aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij military council.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars, where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters seized control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS, last week.
But it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, really the civilians were kidnapped by Isis fighters while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health that document publicity cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but it is based on the law.
The Home Office previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Home Secretary's events to the Evening News.
The minister justified the decision with guidance from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the minister's calendar and not in accounting material.
The Ministry’s Communications Director says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's final Olympic showdown begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time in the run-up to the title race.
He injured his hamstring early in the season and had to miss the Olympic trials in Jamaica.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've trained well and that's the key thing," Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included scantily clad samba dancers and journalists turned fans.
The buzz surrounding Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican's star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he qualified in the first 200 meters with a time of 21.05.
Bolt, who was 17 at the time, was a young promise slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred metres to smash the world record and rivals' confidence with a time of 9.69 despite the final celebration.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career, measured by the clock.
The Berlin-born world records of 9.58 in the 100 meters and 19.19 in the 200 still stand.
In Rio, Bolt has stated that he is aiming for a 200m world record and 19sec under, but no one but Bolt himself believes it will come about.
In the 100, Bolt's toughest challenger is Olympic 100 champion Justin Gatlin of Athens in 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup finals, Bolt defeated the American by just one-hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has never lost a title race final, if only he has made the trip.
In Daegu in 2011, Bolt missed the 100th World Cup final because of a guileless start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympics.
The last finish line of his career has Bolt set for next year's World Cup in London.
This is the Olympics that sets me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year, I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes charged with doping
According to China's state-run news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample showed traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample that shows signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100m butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has referred his doping case to the International Court of Appeal for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample provided by Xinyi on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping allegations have also come to light in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female hurdler Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample that shows signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya, meanwhile, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had impersonated an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, it is Kenyan fast running coach John Anzrah.
The Daily Mail said he had used 800m runner Ferguson Rotich's race pass in the situation.
There's no stopping Phelps - historic gold came show-style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States swam in the 200-meter mixed doubles for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps became the first swimmer to achieve Olympic gold in the same discipline at a fourth consecutive Games.
Phelps' winning time was 1:54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in the mixed heats ahead of China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a bit of fun," BBC Olympic swimming commentator Helen Skelton laughs in a quick interview with the Evening Gazette.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is among the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next up is commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little buzz on social media or in the British press about her revealing and extraordinary outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he insists.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a shortish dress that is sure to have at least enough exposure - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back-and-forths.
It's important to look good, and small fusses are just a fun thing to do.
I'm sure Skelton will want to be startled and maybe startled, but he stresses he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus needs to be on the athletes.
It shouldn’t matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the uproar reaching as far as Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big of a sacrifice they make is OK with me," Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a stir out of nowhere if it comes from (the host's) dressing.
I'm a little amused if this kind of thing has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests over terror suspect
Rio police announced Thursday that they had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
Police made the arrests in connection with security monitoring of the games.
Police made five other arrests in the same connection and questioned two people before their release.
All of the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, those arrested for terrorism are part of the same group whose members were already detained by police in July.
Those arrested are believed to have links to the Islamic State extremist group.
Those arrested had reportedly fueled the violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been circulated on the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
Eighty-five thousand police officers will be in charge of security for the Rio Games.
Police detonate suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their preliminaries of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty concourse on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
Police let the public in after a controlled detonation of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
Police cordoned off the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public was allowed in after the package was detonated in a controlled manner by police.
The crowd did not reach the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for some time because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police detonated the package and allowed the public into the hangar only after.
The bang woke the Spanish team that started the Games sleepily.
Spain, which started the Games with two defeats, beat Nigeria by a score of 96-87.
In the previous two Games, Spain achieved silver.
Police carried out a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Summer Games in Rio.
The last time police had to detonate a suspicious find was in the vicinity of a road cycling finish line last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their preliminaries of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame put on Petäjä-Siren - the Finn reflected on the protest
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a colourful day in Rio.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren had a tough time on Thursday.
The Argentine dame bucked Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio in the opening start of women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted a misdemeanor.
He was stranded by the crash, and the others ran away, Finland's head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
For a long time, the athlete considered protesting.
It was then not worth doing because it would have been pointless under Olympic rules.
I should have dropped into the water to get a refund," Ms Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was left 27th when he left with the crash.
Overall, London's 2012 Olympic silver medallist is eighth.
As for the tip, the crash made little difference.
It's an important day on Friday, when you've got races going from 10 to 12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not make a protest.
7 things science says will make you live longer
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some of the things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that their life becomes longer.
Other times, things that a person has no control over themselves can bring them extra years.
These include a propensity for middle-body obesity or social status.
Shopping regularly can prolong your life.
You don't always have to spend money - just picking up a carton of milk is enough.
Many studies have been conducted to uncover the secret of long life.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research findings.
Science suggests that all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a "reduced risk of death," especially when it comes to neurological or heart-related diseases.
On the other hand, studies suggest that moderate consumption - between one and three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived longer than people who didn't drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to more than six years, one study says.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway revealed how laughter can affect a person’s lifespan.
The seven-year-long project observed more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for your health, according to many studies.
On top of that, it can also extend your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years in their life, they also need to have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise brings extra years, there's no denying that.
However, achieving long life does not require absolute grace.
One study from Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete who medaled at the Olympics or an actor who won an Oscar, he's more likely to live beyond the usual plump.
Many studies have attempted to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his or her life.
Some researchers suspect that long life is due to a person’s social status – which, for its part, makes it possible to seek recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour among over-65s found that the person who shopped every day was likely to live longer than the person who shopped less often.
This is because running in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that can cause premature death.
So put down your credit card - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
Drunk driver hit by truck
A serious head-on collision between a lorry and a passenger car took place in Koski, Southwest Finland, on Friday evening.
The accident happened in Koski, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie at 9pm on Friday.
The lorry had been driving in the direction of Forssa when the oncoming passenger car had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the lorry.
The lorry remained upright in its lane after the collision but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car swerved into a ditch and then over a ditch onto its roof.
A woman who was born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was pinned down in her car.
Emergency services removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Hospital for treatment.
The result of the female breathalyzer test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Mail sent loose candy to wrong city
The Salo K-Citymarket’s selection of loose candy was incomplete because the post office had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by mistake.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught her eye.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll have more when the Post Office gets the load!
So if not a traffic jam in mowing the lawn, the sign read.
The store's foxy signage is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Grass cutting is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia found the sign mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
The media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention this issue has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favourites in a bag of loose candy, even though a few laurels were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for Posti’s Business Transport Services, expressed his regret for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed in the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer left to make a partial delivery (to Salo) with three, but only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening News.
You didn’t get angry at the sign because you found all your favorites.
30 kilos lightened Lotta Backlund posted a photo of her transformation
The comedian-producer has slimmed down by dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of the life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos of her transformation on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian and TV producer Lotta Backlund started her dieting career already in 2009.
He has a complete lifestyle change and has gradually lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a pair of photos of her soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after photo pairing has garnered several complimentary comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We are on the same journey, motivation is strong.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let’s do it now project.
I get a lot of energy and enthusiasm from your pictures, when I am on the same journey, another person tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last few pounds on the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to get to a normal weight, which was then ten kilos away.
During a three-month fitness course, the pounds eventually dropped by five.
Family of woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago is hoping that the victim will be remembered with a donation to police dog work instead of flowers and petitions.
Sipoo Veterinary Centre has posted a Facebook update where it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations going to police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked as a substitute at Sipoo Veterinary Centre and had also completed her nursing practice there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Good Friend.
We still cannot fully comprehend that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money will go in full to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own yard in Koskenkylä, Finland.
The woman's neighbors told the newspaper that the victim was an animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and they had no connection to each other.
The killer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was fatally wounded in the arrest.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
District Court Convicts Posti of Violation of Equality Act
Posti had no right to withhold the pay of an employee who refused to introduce a temporary worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimated in its judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the wages withheld and EUR 2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only a part of the onboarding employee’s salary that corresponded to the onboarding’s share of the entire day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Finnish Post and Logistics Union PAU’s organizational decision on the induction ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees would not familiarise temporary workers with the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey must return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalists’ Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in their letter, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly highlighted the importance of freedom of the press and expression to Turkey.
Putin sacks head of his administration, replaces him with Estonian-based Persecution
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired presidential administration chief Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
In his place will be Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet-Estonian communist leader Karl Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy chief of the presidential administration since 2012.
Persecution will also become a member of Russia's Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close-knit inner circle, will take up special duties in environmental and transport matters, according to a Kremlin statement.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and suggested Persecution to replace him, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era on KGB espionage.
Ivanov was considered by many to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his post in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned - not to be seen in Premier League opener
The world football transfer record-holder will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed along for England.
Manchester United boss Paul Pogba will be on the sidelines as ManU open their league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media.
However, he will be kept out of the game by the English FA as Pogba was left burdened with a ban from Juventus.
He received two cautions in last season's Italian Cup, and will serve a one-match ban.
That ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, delusion of grandeur is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of cosiness have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festival-goers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area is decorated with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, which takes place in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small event to tens of thousands of visitors.
Behind the success lies a simple question: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It's quite unusual in productions to think that way.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the authorities’ regulations,” says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out this year as well.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors last year by 5,000.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too much because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered in huge pathways.
We don't want that.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been expanded to include 130 performers, art installations, numerous restaurant outlets and drinks bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performance stages, a tent of 15,000 people will serve as a venue this year.
Rock admits that the event could be done more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve the spirit of Flow.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today even great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the support of approximately EUR 20,000 from the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company that runs Flow was approximately six million euros.
It can be used to create "creepy things" such as the construction of a 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
But the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost in terms of content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer in a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time we will see him at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done a heck of a lot of good gigs in the last few years.
Bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - as tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured in the attack.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flowerpot and detonated using cellphones.
The bombs were planted on a street most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, said police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran, according to CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a telling picture of the attacks.
If you can't see the tweet properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said a bomb had gone off by the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets," Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning local time, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket.
No one was reportedly killed.
Meanwhile, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had reportedly found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had yet to detonate.
Thai officials say the bombings are likely to be carried out by insurgent forces who are not satisfied with the actions of Thailand's military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police had recently seized on the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will go to battle first in war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered into combat duties until several months after taking the military oath, according to Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Defence Training, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable, for example, conscripts serving for 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the training manager, reserve personnel belonging to the standby force will be assigned first.
No conscript or reservist will be told to do a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it emerged that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts for immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola awarded huge compensation for mould house
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330,000.
However, after the deal was made, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple were forced to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma was as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price cut from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District and Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled in the case on Wednesday.
It upheld a district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma €150,000 in price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple’s legal and settlement costs totalling EUR 47,344.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly because the buyers had already been aware of some need to repair the dwelling when the housing transaction was made.
However, the apparent construction defects were substantially more serious than had been suggested, according to the Court of Appeal.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Mr Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had a feeling that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the factors mentioned in the condition inspection report were not harmful.
The condition inspection report cited ventilation as a risk and a lack of adequate management of rain and meltwater running down the rocky surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the notion that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be slightly controlled within a few years.
The deals were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which witnesses said was caused by both rock rainwaters and capillary-raised soil moisture.
On the western side of the house, the inspector estimated, microbially contaminated air could also enter the interior through the porch.
Mould or yeast exceeding the health risk limits was found in smear samples in the utility room, the basement staircase, the living room window bay, and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
There was also a dispute in court over whether the flat had been extended in breach of a building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that changes to the apartment had been made in violation of the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although proper permits were not yet in place.
But mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, the buyers could have assumed, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as is and that there was no need for extensive renovation work in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt there was no particular reason for a wider-than-usual inspection.
The purchasers have not failed in their duty of explanation, the Court of Appeal said in its judgment.
Creepy archive find: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to bear children for Nazis - register also includes Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article in Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives in Maryland, Maryland, has microfilmed documents on a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from a race agency in Nazi Germany.
The race agency operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to bear more than 10 children.
Andersson said the women were undergoing gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The race agency vetted women's backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The idea was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and give the National Board of Breeds handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The race agency wanted assurances that women were "child-loving," "sparing," and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides by SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created the state-sponsored program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and subsidized having children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honour was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the 6th day, Nirkko rose and fell.
Tapio Nirkko finished third in Finnjollie’s first start of the day at the Olympic Games in Rio, but he was the tail end of the group in his second start of the day.
Nirkko moved up to eighth in the overall standings after five starts, but a failure to finish second dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought for positions 17 and three in the RS:X class day start.
Overall, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained in 23rd place at the day's opening start.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Fairytale Castle was recorded during a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
From cruise ship bartender to tango king in 1995, best-selling solo artist in Finland and star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää can still bounce and he is currently on a rampage.
A book written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of her favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career, both good and bad.
Sillanpää’s career took off when he won the crown of the Tango King at the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the competition, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen arranged in a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go quite as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hungover!
The bridge remembers in the book.
You wouldn't immediately guess from recording a song that has become a huge hit that it's been sung with a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the print was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand perfection and excellence from yourself all the time.
Another incident involving one of the man's most popular songs, recounted in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with his then partner and the case also eventually ended up in the texts of You deserve gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, but it was written based on the news in 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper reported that Jari’s break-up with his ex-lover was caused by Jari’s excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and not true.
Jari called the label furiously and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and good for him.
In June, the British even surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52 percent of voters were in favor of secession and 48 percent would have remained in the Union, even though polls during polling week anticipated the opposite outcome.
Britain's economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the difference, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
Former US President Bill Clinton’s campaign slogan “It’s the economy, stupid” flew into the dust during the Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics after all.
Economic Curly Tongue
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics draws responses from the profession to the Brexit debacle.
The most typical answer is not to listen to the economists, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation economists have for the loss of economic standing is that people don't understand the economy.
Many people still believe that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right Brit.
Many also have the notion that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes export industries.
In the economist's view, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up sufficiently.
They were particularly impressed by the BBC’s level playing field, which gave as much room to the two-percent-plus economists in favour of leaving the EU as it did to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling us what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other combinations of economic might about the consequences of separation are.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not, in their own opinion, have common interests.
Yes, big-city academics like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message didn't work.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming victory argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant congestes your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign workers in every coffee shop.
How many more jobs would Britons have if they walked away?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would a Brit get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the children of a real Brit get a school place if they got rid of them?
Every town has foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they bailed?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses received no visibility.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, Britons have even more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their spending generates jobs.
Aberdeen property fund braced for Brexit cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said people in Aberdeen were preparing in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Preparations for Plan B, the victory of the pro-EU camp, began to unfold a few weeks before the vote in case the result was to leave.
The worry was that investors would start to pull their funds out of the market.
Real estate funds normally don't have sizeable liquid assets, but now they could be needed.
We set out to increase cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 per cent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open-ended daily quoted property fund affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5bn.
In total, the company's funds are worth about £20bn.
It was the highest number of any of the nine open-ended property funds, Vanhanen says of all the open-ended property funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at or even below ten per cent.
So property funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trading
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went berserk.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, in which he judged that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first of the property funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together bungled the situation and put the issue in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
That put investors on edge.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to roll, and fund after fund was forced to close.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worth pulling out the money now in a panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't pay, as there would be losses.
It calmed things down, and most of them retracted the announcement.
Since then it has been fairly steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been nothing like the turmoil in Aberdeen's continental Europe funds, for example.
But there were a lot of queries.
Unreasonable attention to property funds
Vanhanen felt that the closings of real estate fund transactions received an inordinate amount of attention.
Open-ended funds, which were affected by the closures, control about 4 per cent of UK property.
Aberdeen's lockdown lasted six days, with the company selling off fewer than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may keep its funds closed into 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, with growth forecasts for the economy raved down, but the situation does not look "more dire" for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound-dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, in addition to a 15 per cent sell-off in the market ahead of the Brexit vote.
A dollar buyer can now buy the same property for up to 30 per cent less.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit has hit London’s property market
By 2 a.m., the situation still didn't look like much.
But at 4am, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is in charge of property investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British property fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the power word.
I realized that this now goes to plan B, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the early hours of the morning.
TV screens normally set to silent at the office blared the news, and the usually loud crowd completely hushed to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, display terminals flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you'd live," Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's biggest property funds, finalised two property deals the day after the Brexit vote, or midsummer.
The mood was mixed.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, which is why the situation was calm in a way, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote sparks corrective move
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound plummeted, Britain's lead went to the exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp falls for the UK property market, and London in particular.
Minuses of up to 20 per cent were anticipated for London office space in the coming years.
Soon, a group of UK property funds began to freeze their trading one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days, too.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty still hangs in the air.
Not that it shows on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
He thinks it is still far too early to say much about what will come of Brexit.
So much remains open: how the separation will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial data on developments in the London property market are already available.
Real estate services company CBRE's data on price trends cover about a third of the market.
They show that prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't that dire, but they are month-to-month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops coincided with the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.
It’s also interesting because Brexit was quickly compared to the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
He does not think this is an appropriate comparison, as it is now a domestic crisis.
There's another mood, too.
The real estate market has now seen not panic selling like that period but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is normally available.
The repair business could have been ahead anyway
In fact, the move to fix prices is no wonder to him - one that could have been ahead even without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that property prices in London and other world number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City, and especially the offices, are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have edged up for four reasons, the Old List.
The UK economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last ownership class to globalize, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking abroad for real estate investments.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by low interest rates, which have forced pension providers, for example, to look for returns on new items.
On top of this, loans have been readily available - although, according to Vanhanen, clearly less leverage has been used now than during the pre-crisis boom of 2008.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price growth levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten its holdings in London, and turned out to be a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turnaround to be expected, and now it came.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
Not much he dares to estimate for the future, but says there is unlikely to be any upward spike.
The mood suggests that there is a downward or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen several moves up and down, having been in real estate since 1988.
And still he's an optimist who believes you can get out of potholes with a job.
If you're well prepared for the risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim of it.
If you have decentralised, the risks have also been decentralised, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register shopping information more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you eat, as the trading group said today that it will start collecting more detailed information on its regular customers’ purchases.
After collecting information on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it in the beginning of May also for purchased products.
S Group follows Kesko in this regard, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback on the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer’s consent and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have denied the use of product information, says Riitala to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to their food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is only collected from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and there are no plans to do so at this time.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information on product or category levels, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know which store the purchases were made in and which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We haven't gone to the level that K-Group or S-Group have," says Anu Ora, Commercial Director.
He said the loyalty program is to be overhauled in the future, but Local Store will tell us later.
Ora does not, however, promise that product information will be registered.
First the experiment
So far, SOK’s customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The S-Etukortti purchase includes the date and time of purchase, location, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the details of the S-bonus partners are obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchasing information will be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In S-markets, Prismas, Kodin Terros and ABC chains, however, data are currently recorded at the product group level.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in escrow anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your stored information on S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is the latest dog reinforcement from Customs - puppy becomes the first explosive dog
A black Labrador puppy sniffs vigorously at five similar boxes lined up on the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favorite toy.
The box Heila was sitting next to revealed a jar full of shell casings that smelled of gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila the dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog specialised in finding weapons and explosives and will be located at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, the tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures to be taken at Customs, and after the attacks, control has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, the inspector general of Customs.
Another main reason for training a dog with weapons and explosives is the postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of increased internet trade, up to 40 million items of mail pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, among online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will be looking at checked baggage and mail items.
In the future, ports will benefit greatly by being able to go through large container areas and mark areas that require further investigation, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Mr Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila-puppy’s training is coordinated by the Finnish Customs dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training sessions with Heila’s police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Finnish Defence Forces has expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides which odors Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport include six drug dogs from Customs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador Heila has been chosen from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and streams of people.
Heila, who lives at Suntio’s home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be done without him at home, he laughs.
Subtle orders go straight to Heila.
The Ilta-Sanomat cameraman loses the camera mic cover for the fast dog, but Heila returns what appears to be a soft toy immediately on the "disconnect" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog wearing a work vest,” Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year.
They have a working age of about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work periods only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is strong competition to become a working dog owner at Customs.
About 20-30 Customs employees applied to become Heila’s owner.
Luck fell on Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and control tasks at Customs.
Mini-State gets its first Olympic medal; nation gets day off
With a population of less than one million, Fiji's Olympic gold in rugby is valued so highly in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
The country's public broadcaster said Fiji's government confirmed the issue after the championship was decided.
The day off will be the day after the team returns home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fijian rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country watched the final in the capital, Suva, where a screen had been set up in the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them cheering," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer faints after wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola managed his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard-fought race.
For a lifter, Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening characteristic.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one could really say why.
Tokola gained 175 kilos from the push and 145 kilos from the rapture in Rio.
His total was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push on his last 175 pounds, as well as his second.
On the third attempt, the weights lifted, accompanied by a ferocious roar.
The body was trembling under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, which plays in the men's football league, has signed Estonian striker Albert Prosa for the end of the season.
We are looking for a top-ranked player who has the power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Little by little, the group started to stand out as a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where Rovanieme will meet reigning Finnish champion SJK.
There was a need for a new striker for RoPS when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Defiant Modern Family star shrugs off again: teen star's shorts reveal just about everything
Ariel Winter, known as the kind Alex Dunphy of Modern Family, once again flaunts her voluptuous figure.
Winter was photographed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and demeanour to considerably bolder.
The star has posed for photos on social media in very few clothes and has got numerous tattoos.
The young woman has also been seen wearing very scanty outfits.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also posted several photos of herself partying recently.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed her public image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on TV almost her entire life and has grown up in the age of the Kardashians.
He's learned that the more you show the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood," Palmer tells Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started Modern Family when she was just 11 years old.
The actor has outraged some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years when the lows are already that high, notes one woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the woman's fans, by contrast, excuse the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look amazing!
I don't care what anyone says.
You are an inspiration to many women.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the Northern Lights: In autumn, it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to entice Japanese people to start aurora borealis trips already in the early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main destinations for Japanese aurora tourism are Inari and Levi.
The Northern Lights are an asset to our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with hearty winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for winter aurora trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision twice as fabulous, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by researchers at Aalto University and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese people would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and this is where the northern lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed in Finland more than twice as many nights as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese spend 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 race as Fiji champion team wins gold
Great Britain's impressive success in seven-player rugby was shatteringly cut short when Fiji won it in the final at Rio's Deodoro Stadium on Thursday by 43-0.
Fiji taught the masters in ball handling, transfers, side diversions, support play, running lines and brute force, thus winning gold – provided the country had the first Olympic medal in all its history.
The loss meant silver was a slight consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the rugby-7 tournament, which is an Olympic sport for the first time, with the team beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win over the South African Boks by 7-0 in the semi-finals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fiji team in this form would have beaten the Brits even if the 15-strong squad had been at full strength.
For Great Britain, there may be consolation in the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal wrapped around his neck tomorrow: Ben Ryan, the head coach of Fiji, the former coach of the English rugby-7 team from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's coaching, they lost all games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
It hurts to lose, but the progress is startling.
Fiji made an excellent start and showcased their tackling skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It looked as if captain Tom Mitchell and his team had collided with a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a lunge for the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another into the right side from a goal kick.
It was 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's superb tackle prevented stalwart Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of the game, Jasa Veremalua scored into the right corner, and Great Britain were then 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored the second goal of the postseason with more than a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then darted through the Great Britain team's more impotent tackles and dashed over the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in a situation of 29-0.
It seemed like the Fijians are like they were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the sport as apprentices.
Which is very much true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes at half-time and managed to hold off the Fijians for a full four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to excellent team play from the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36-0 by scoring for Great Britain in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelagoers, whose fans in the stands chanted, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure jubilant attitude.
Mata Viliame put the finishing touches on the Fijian's cake by scoring in the final moments yet.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell on the pitch, perfectly smashed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-0 in the semi-finals and Great Britain had edged past South Africa in a tight semi-final where the tie was decided by a Great Britain goal kick.
Kyle Brown took South Africa's Boks into the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his dazzling footwork and crashed off the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of England's 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the win and eventual silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row for gold
This is as emotional as gold could be in these Games.
From the first stroke to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 triumphant strokes into history and found extra purpose for their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although it was the two of them in the oars, it was the voice of coach Robin Williams who echoed in third on the boat, spurring them on to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo. This makes them the first women in the history of British sport to reach a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory was their 39th in a row and a record for them once again.
What we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the water's surface like swans to an age, doesn't entirely match the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large group of helping hands, each contributing to the duo's progress towards achievement. But the most important of the assistants is a coach who, 30 months ago, was diagnosed with cancer and didn't know then whether he would see this day.
Williams said the situation at the time was tight.
'I had bladder cancer, and the tumour was able to be cut out.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the mindset a little bit.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that Williams was able to begin his treatment in the off-season of the sport in early 2014, with the interruption causing minimal harm, if you can even say so now in circumstances such as this.
"I needed the money, so I had to improve quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in hospital and walking around ward six, nine and 15 metres at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the win, the duo's thoughts were with Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal in an effort to overcome his own unease.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "On an emotional level I've been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."
"It just goes to show how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cash register has been fantastic.
Without Robin we'd be nothing, so an insane amount of credit to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train with, or a better coach.'
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in the last five years.
The duo have found an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even in the final 500 meters, as the New Zealand and Danish duos began to draw closer, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very much caught up in the moment.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It's very important not to drift off the route.'
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we weren't aiming to do anything amazing.
We didn't go for the skies today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race, which we did.""
The two will think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover will celebrate her wedding next month with Steve Backshall, from TV nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have put too much pressure on me."
"After London, it was about six months before I realised I was an Olympian.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took me about four minutes to realise.
This feels so much better," she says.
Iceland to change Panama leak-riddled government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were called for as early as the spring by protesters enraged by Panama data leaks.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed several Icelandic politicians had evaded taxes using tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned over the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
At the time, his successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the people's outrage last spring will affect the fall election results.
In the presidential election in June, criticism of the establishment was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has withdrawn his latest remarks.
He said he had been sarcastic in claiming that incumbent President Barack Obama was a co-founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also complicit in its creation.
The Democrat party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be commander-in-chief of the military who can go down like that," Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of a burkini bathing suit, which is popular with Muslims, at beaches, according to the Guardian, a British newspaper, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone not wearing a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The ruling also says that swimwear that grandiosely expresses religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's national day.
In late July, two men linked to the Islamic State group attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest in his 80s.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through a sieve - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae clouding has been observed at Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environment Department took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the action limits given in the decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci levels in the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae cloudage observed at Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into a blue-green algae bloom, resulting in a blue-green algae mass forming in rafts on the water surface.
The environmental action follows up with more frequent inspections.

MTK’s Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Treasury Department's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax for forest farm generational change.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The goal of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure capital income of forestry.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational change in forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK).
However, there are criticisms of the proposed tax changes.
The forest gift deduction is proposed to be made from the forest owner’s pure capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sale of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health starts from the premise that by deducting the pure capital income of forestry, it will prevent the loss of forestry capital income, which should be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit even if no wood is sold.
The calculation model is unnecessarily complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he said, the model only applies to a small percentage of forest owners.
The threshold for the tax deduction linked to the yield value of the forest in the proposal is EUR 40,000.
It seems to have been pulled too high.
As such, he says, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the deduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest owner base, he says.
The Ministry considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of premises.
According to Hakkarainen, forest gift reduction has been taken into account in forest policy for decades.
This is due to the ageing of the forest.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60, and around half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hailstorm surprises motorists on Himanga - two cars swerved into a ditch and collided
There was an unusual chase on the Himanga River on Friday morning.
The emergency services said two cars driving in a row swerved into a ditch, then the one behind collided with the one ahead.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the firefighter on duty, the ditching is suspected to have been caused by a heavy hailstorm.
Two people were in the car that was driving behind, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There are no further details on their injuries.
The driver of the car above was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 from Himanga to Kalajoki a few kilometres away.
Finnish research may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments even more effective.
Findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumour increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, it was possible to prevent cancer growth in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments by focusing not only on cancer cells, but also on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue.
The research results have been published on August 4 in Nature Communications, a respected journal in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing thrashing continues in court, prosecutor seeks murder conviction for another perpetrator as well
Muhos' family home killing thrashing continues at the court for both convicts.
Two young men were jailed in June for a family house killing in Muhos.
The other received 8 years 4 months for, among other things, manslaughter and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The other's sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangerment of traffic safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle as an unwarranted young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man with the harsher sentence.
The prosecution is seeking a lesser sentence for a man convicted of murder as a young person and sentenced to 12 years in prison.
They were fully understood at the time.
According to the district court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a counselor for the school's child welfare unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked the director from behind on a sofa in the living room, according to the sentencing arguments.
The director had got out of his grip and walked the youth to his room, at which point one of the youths hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also, among other things, strangled with a cord, punched and kicked in the head.
According to the mental examination, both convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court heard the youths had been planning an escape from the family home since at least the previous day.
Ice shark is world's longest-living vertebrate, only breeding at 156
An ice shark has been confirmed as the world's longest living vertebrate, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, an ice shark, or ferret, that swims around Greenland can live up to 400 years.
The female doesn't breed until she's 156.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimetre a year.
Only one species of mussel is known to outlive ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive traces.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although a throw in one direction or the other could be as long as 120 years.
Donald Trump on economic wisdom - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world.
As much as a third of the state's total tax revenue would be unreceived if the corporate tax change pushed by Donald Trump is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, particularly through tax breaks that benefit the very richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
Corporate tax would fall from 35 per cent to 15 per cent.
A truly staggering sum of $1,000bn a year would be left uncollected.
The top income tax rate now stands at 39.6, after a reduction of 33 proposed by Trump.
Inheritance tax would be abandoned altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulating the business community and pushing small businesses into bankruptcy.
Urgently-decided environmental standards need to be reformed and energy regulation deregulated.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
We need to appoint "experts rather than bureaucrats" to the administration.
"Destructive" trade policies are among the main causes of the US's problems, according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
Imports from China and Mexico would be subject to a 45 percent and 35 percent punitive tax, respectively.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need the rest of the world:
American cars will drive through the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will watch at sea, American steel will raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
In contrast to his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program as taking the U.S. into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her plan early Friday.
Attack wave from the past - People's News
The sea rumbles fatally, but the real tidal wave hits amid the bustle of Madrid's streets - a reckoning with the past can begin.
That's the crux of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar’s previous work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a satirical comedy that was slightly funny and lopsided, and its predecessor, Skin in which I Live (2011), was one of the best films of the Spanish artist’s career.
In terms of level, Julieta (2016) falls somewhere between those two works.
It's a conventionally serene love, relationship and family drama centred on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on track for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to implode.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) gets to be amazed right up to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recaps the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before her daughter was born, the moments she met her father-to-be (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, from the TV-familiar series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014), will take on the second female lead.
Julieta's ageing has been handled in a way that can be considered clunky, but I'd say it's time to swipe.
To the razzle-dazzle often so characteristic of Almodóvar films, right down to the humor, Julieta is a fair distance.
It's an evenly acted, restrained, place with good music in some places, and quite a sad film with elements of elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of a Spanish director is still there, so that it slowly starts to look more like a pure technicality than a functioning dramatic effect.
People in the film are affected by illness, death or otherwise just sudden loss, but the surface remains just as Korean.
This is especially true of costume: in the case of the title character, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same goes for the showy earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the tunings of the respective scenes, do not improve particularly from here.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is outward and a little spiritless.
Almodóvar has written the screenplay based on three short stories by Canadian Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Tales.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat evenly written literary film.
There would have been emotionally incomparably more robust drama, so big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the movie's theme deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Cast: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film opens at 12.8.
Government tries election gimmick - People's News
There will be no new cuts, say ministers, to prevent the True Finns from collapsing completely.
Cuts decided in the spring, however, are being made in a raft of ways.
There will be no new cuts.
The $4 billion in savings that has already been decided will be enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (college) assure us under the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the Ministry’s proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits discussion.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit will be reduced from 500 to 400 days.
Education cuts will continue.
Municipal elections haunted
Why are ministers so keen to highlight the very fact that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer of the election season, not the polls.
We have seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, the Gallups report that the governing party True Finns faces a rumbling defeat, even though the result of its previous election was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
The True Finns gained 752 new councillors four years ago, and for most of them the right-wing government will realize the price of influence next spring.
The lifeblood of a government of three roughly equal parties depends on the Finns Party’s cant to last.
Now it hasn't lasted, with more than half of those who voted for the party having had enough of government policy already in the first year.
The first signs of ferment in the party's parliamentary group have also surfaced.
The rhetoric about no new cuts will, first, obscure the fact that next year they will be made drastically and, second, try to soften the blow that awaits the True Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the objective of reducing indebtedness during this parliamentary term, but in Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal, EUR 5.9 billion of debt will be taken on next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to put your hands up as early as the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government will not be able to follow its own programme: the indebtedness will not fold or even slow down.
The second is to stick with the program.
That means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring parliamentary elections what comes will be taken up.
These actions do not reduce debt.
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not decrease, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove this irrefutably:
Global growth forecasts have repeatedly proved over-optimistic, meaning there will be no traction from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has barely budged since the crash experienced in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and extended from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the graphs presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be around six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the True Finns on what is responsible.
Poll: There are a lot of tasks to be left to local authorities
Three out of four consider that the organisation of children’s day care, youth work and physical activity is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also passes the responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, community colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
Regional planning, specialised health care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled are most clearly wanted for the county.
None of the responsibilities of local authorities are transferred to the state.
Underage drink-driver ran from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu was running away from a police patrol on Ilomantsintie at around 1:30 on Friday night.
A police patrol tried to pull over a motorcycle that had been riding without lights, but the young man set out to run away from police at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantantie, then to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed police officer ran to catch the fugitive.
A breathalyzer test on the driver showed 0.75 per mille.
He also did not have a driver's license to ride a motorcycle.
Among other things, the incident is being investigated as a gross endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck loaded with rocks overturned in a ditch
A truck loaded with rocks overturned in a ditch at Polvijärvi on Kaavintie at 9.15pm on Thursday night.
The truck had veered off the road on a left curving bend and overturned on its side in a ditch.
Emergency services lifted the injured driver off the overturned truck through a door above, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
It was left to the car owner to lift the vehicle.
Hydraulic oil spilled from the overturned truck onto the road and was sucked into the peat by the emergency services.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in the Gulf of Finland.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimetres tall, slim and of good posture, with white under-the-jaw hair.
Any sightings and clues to the missing person's movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre's hotline on 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see a photo gallery of the Parafest's devastation
The plume that toppled the tents at the Parafest festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, President of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to get back on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances at the City Theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program will be organized as planned.
A surge is created in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending airflow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thundercloud trap heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its pace toward the ground accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of the surges is difficult to predict.
The rushing current hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue of Parafesti, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents overturned, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported with minor injuries for further treatment.
Air pollution ages Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skincare firm Caci analysed the most toxic fine particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two-and-a-half years older than that of, say, a peer living in the countryside.
Skin-aging fine particulate matter is a very fine dust pollutant that originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illness, which nearly 9,500 Londoners die from every year, according to the Evening Standard.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's research found that early ageing is a risk, especially for Londoners who commute by foot near crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution with a variety of masks, for example, but a more practical solution recommends regular skin cleansing.
Tractor brakes fail - shoves man standing in front
The man had been moving stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got off the tractor and went to visit in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor spilled on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor did nudge the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor did not have time to spill further, as it collided with rocks in front of it.
Renewed vigour for the coming season
League-Riento, which plays in the Volleyball Championship, will go into the series, which kicks off in October, on better footing than in recent memory.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common ground can be found with greater certainty than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rieno.
Jani Säisä, who will continue as Rienno’s head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni will start his second season in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-olds Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who has featured for Rwanda's national team, is a chipper at 205 centimetres.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian measures 198 centimetres.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball competitions since 2003.
Now the sixth Games are underway in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American qualifying.
I was working in Turku and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was building a floorball team.
I got interested and here we are, says Jumppanen, 48.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen studied computer science at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport played at SM-level as floorball.
Sähly was played in college.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball with the university in the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
While playing, she coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
The women's championship career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM-series for 10 seasons, the balance was 51+34=85 in 169 matches.
The most recent SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Joensuu-based floorball club Josba was bred by Perttu Puska and uncle-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to play for Finland in the Czech Republic’s Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, a 25-year-old attacking player in Helsinki, has played in six men’s national matches before this, where he has accumulated a total power play score of 9+4=13.
Tatu Väänänen, the 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, has recovered from a thigh problem and is part of the national team's regular equipment with 117 international appearances.
Seinäjoki Peliveljet’s veteran player Mika Kohonen, who was last seen in a Finland shirt at last December’s World Cup, was also named to the national team.
Petri Kettunen is the head coach of the national team.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold is missing from the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after the current season.
The Finnish championships of the Beach Volley will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over three days, the medals will be played in both adult and youth leagues.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the top six pairs in the rankings are eligible for the final tournament.
Essi Hasu, who grew up in the YMCA of Elimäki and has been one of the top beach volleyball players in Finland for several years, will represent the local colour in the tournament.
Hasu, who now lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar crowd.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be in the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for the baseball stadium.
I haven’t played in the adult leagues very often either, so it’s great to play in the finals at home,” Hasu says.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu’s passion for sports and gave him a good lunch for a great hobby.
I have very fond memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in YMCA E-girls of Elimäki.
The main thing in mind is a jersey that is too big, kneepads that roll at the ankles, as well as staggering ace shouts and choreography after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment that was fun to play in.
Everyone's families were heavily involved - a team-mate's father coached us and our mother was president of the club for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, the beach volleyball was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball during his junior years.
The beach has been used for biting since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to watch the Junior Finnish Championships, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki in the SM-finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-honey we're still missing from the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws enigmatically.
This weekend's performance in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civilian work await.
The international career is over after the tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
Crashing stream toppled tents at disabled event in Joensuu, major accident was imminent

According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, there were a total of about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the bigger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, the on-call firefighter interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the makings of a major accident.
The paper says the continuation of the event hangs in the balance.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in the countryside.
Koli started working with his younger brother Valtteri Koli almost two years ago as a follower of their homestead.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always enjoyed working on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we set out to build a yardless barn, and at first the bank wasn't enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was really brave enough to join the project, and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
Salomon Koli, which grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten young food producers in the Rural Future magazine competition.
He is currently vying for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the newspaper's Web site until Aug. 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (since June 2012) and the first time it will rise above zero since October last year, when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2 per cent.
The annual average inflation rate as measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 percentage compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared with the previous month, prices of the following consumer goods groups increased in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), means of transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and periodical maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained on level with the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's Anime Boost Is Criticized as an Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter in question was inspired by anime, but some observers think it's racist.
Snapchat's lens tool allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that approximate absurdity.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are unvarnished, feature-distorting tools used to create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any missteps will quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have been met with criticism, where it has been accused of favouring blackface make-up or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users a filter this week that turned their eyes crooked, twisted teeth and made cheeks plump, some of the reviewers called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Detractors also wondered whether these recurring conflicts point to a larger problem the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage spread widely on Wednesday and was written about by online publications such as The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently denied the anime metaphor.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the images was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "offensive and awkward to say the least."
He adds: "It's hard to dispute the juxtaposition of highly tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface," but one taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat isn't the only company that needs to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be in a never-ending struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood to the gadgets we carry with us.
Snapchat's large audience is made up of young people from more diverse ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This could mean they are likely to expect discretion even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, these types of things don't go unnoticed very easily anymore, as they did in the past," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview Thursday.
Mr. Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In her post on Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believed the conflicts surrounding ethnicity reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white and male-only leadership and concluded his post with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either the case that there are no people of color on their one-sided staff, allowing them to make these kinds of decisions, or they have people of color as employees as well, but their status is not such that they would dare to give their opinion directly and easily" says Zhu, who is Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The firm does not release figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, citing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say this is not OK."
Congressional expert group says military officials misrepresented intelligence on ISIS
On Thursday, a group of congressional experts released a report saying officers in the U.S. armed forces, known as Central Command, altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground suggested.
The Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, a subcommittee responsible for intelligence and defense appropriations, set up a task force with an interim report detailing "general dissatisfaction" among military intelligence analysts. Analysts say senior military officials glossed over their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, also known as Centcom, is the United States military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence results approved by senior CENTCOM leaders generally provided a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than the facts on the ground indicated, and were invariably more positive than those in analyses by other units in the intelligence community," according to a press release on the report.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when high-level policymakers are presented with the wrong analyses,” said California Republican Rep. Ken Calvert.
"Centcom executive errors extend to top tier of organization".
The 10-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 with Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While the report contains no conclusive evidence that the reports commissioned by Obama administration officials were fabricated, it gives analysts an impression that Centcom executives had pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," it said.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement saying a major military assault to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders in the U.S. armed forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
Republicans set up the task force after learning of suspicions raised by analysts that intelligence about ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, released Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results, as investigations continue.
In addition, the Defense Department's inspector general has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own results, in part consistent with the Republican task force's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic member of the committee.
Schiff said this process "delayed the release of the intelligence results, "violated the morale of analysts" and "insufficiently noted dissenting views."
But Schiff and Democrats said there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "predetermined or political official line."
The news site Daily Beast reported the preliminary results of a congressional inquiry on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general that was launched as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
Still, he says, "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and Department of Defense welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key national security topics."
The investigation has other repercussions besides seeking to determine whether the U.S.-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an assertion made by an increasing number of defense officials).
But the allegations last year put into question how much confidence President Obama can have in Central Command and in giving honest assessments of the military mission in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the intelligence on ISIS echoes disagreements that emerged more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study showing that President George W. Bush's government, despite the objections of many analysts, advocated only small forces in Iraq and spent little time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurgency over intelligence about ISIS.
Officials said last year Hooker's task force concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terror group's economy because it had built makeshift refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
But the outcome of the investigation was not relayed outside Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after many lawmakers judged the testimony given to the Senate to have been overly positive assessments of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced as commander of Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. wins fourth duel in women's field hockey and establishes itself for showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning, goal-scoring 6-1 decision against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States beat India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a major achievement, but the 27-year-old Bam wasn't sure he's ever managed the same before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keeps track of the goals they score."
But here's what he knows: The Americans have won four games and lost zero games in their Olympic tournament and share first place in their group with Britain, which extended its winning streak when it beat Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Each team made it to the final, which will determine which of them finishes first and second in the six-team group.
The first-place finisher will avoid a longer encounter with the hard-pressed Dutch team, which won the second section.
Regardless of how Saturday's game pans out, the Americans have already kicked up a fuss about their surprising success at these Games, four years after falling behind the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
Growing up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, she didn't grab a field hockey bat for the first time until she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel). She made the national team at 16 and thus was the youngest national team player ever.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final list of players.
This was followed by the 2012 Games, which saw few successes from him and his team.
The following year Craig Parnham, from England, was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our work rate in London was not what it is now.
We've done an about-face.'
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal account in the first half by hitting the ball from close range with a backhand shot in.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam stepped on to the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the left side of the court, squirmed into center field, beat the ball to the goal and thus took the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The game was the first of the tournament in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep a goal blank. In the first three games, the Americans' goal had sunk in each of one hit.
Briggs is now living out his season of success,
Same as bam.
"Our positioning is good now," says Parnham, but how good depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Amid Olympic buzz, trampoline brings zen
Regardless of the location and time, the Olympics will inevitably come across.
Rio de Janeiro's events, rivalries and struggles seem to follow with a fervent message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic flame itself were a flaming baton, passing from archer to swimmer, from swimmer to gymnast and from gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the queue at the cafe without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the row between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a guy named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian, charms with her smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips, visible and heard in prime time viewing and listening, popular with sponsors and appearing in feel-good TV ads, if only she were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, will compete for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Farther from the centre, partly in the shade are lesser-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest piece about my own special favourite, I'd like to draw attention to the understated charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be region-specific.
Of course, athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never made the medals and did not advance to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side, the medals have been hogged by the Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoline, however, has the charm of an underdog. Partly because to an uncivilised ear it sounds more appropriate for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I admit that I am not an expert, just a fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which cartoons have used in the characters" endlessly continuous bounce scenes. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming, that is, the sports that connect in a trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "the springboard."
Ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline that catapults them to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic maneuvers such as twists, folds and flips.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are graded based on performance, severity and "flight time."
Thirty-two athletes from 17 different countries are competing in Rio for the trampoline gymnastics championship. Of them, 16 are men and 16 are women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medal hopes have to get further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, other times back and forth around the field.
Beyond the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to aim for in televised reportage, namely a world or Olympic record.
This single-minded pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical – and even enough to bring the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just watching the games.
This is where the trampoline offers respite.
On the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and effortlessly flits back up.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect to the sport, and it's not easy either, but it doesn't involve a frantic rush to the finish line or jumping far, just a dreamy and fluid combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only an Olympic competition can get.
The women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and begin at 1 p.m. local time and the men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will air the finals as part of its afternoon coverage, which begins at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
Amid the Olympic mania bring a moment of calm and loveliness that, amid the general buzz, might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be raised by offering male athletes who appeal to the eye and objectifying them – as the US male gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his panting new legion of fans.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcefully broken up protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
But over the past few months, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests that are spilling over into ever wider areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political change.
Human rights groups said the government's reaction was relentless.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Videos purportedly from the protests late last year or early this year show youths being beaten with sticks by security forces forced to stand with their hands against a wall.
The top U.N. human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward all the more so," said Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group at the Africa Horn project.
In terms of population, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by Western countries.
The US military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats across the region, especially in Somalia. Few African countries, if any, are getting this much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has been growing at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, with the capital Addis Ababa even having a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from being a model democracy: human rights organisations have consistently reported on the government's repressive policies, opposition in the country is very limited and dissent is quickly muted.
Many people have been driven out of the country, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But that could be about to change.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to demonstrate, it will erupt out," says Seyoum Teshome, who works as a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
"The whole youth is protesting.
A whole generation protested."
There are many topics of discontent, from land use to the governing coalition's stranglehold on power.
After last year's widely criticised election, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat previously belonging to the opposition, and as a result now control the entire parliament.
Meanwhile, tensions are rising along the Eritrean border, where an escalating situation claimed hundreds of lives in a battle in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less defeated in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the turmoil and rearm.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood that has been smouldering under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is patently innocent: smartphones.
Only for the past couple of years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as more affordable smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, however, many access the internet through proxies that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to the protests.
Another reason is increased solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest populations, the Oromo and the Amhara.
The Oromo and the Amhara are not natural allies.
Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands have long dominated the country's politics and business and have dispossessed Oromos, much of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But this, too, is changing.
"The collaboration is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amharic regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet controls the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at spotting the first signs of discontent and using envoys to mediate between the opposing sides.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says Abdi, the conflict researcher.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped into Meles's shoes from near obscurity.
Unlike Meles, who hailed from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not have the confidence of security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced similar riots was in 2005, when thousands protested against an election that analysts say was first botched and then stolen by the government.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though there were fewer deaths than in previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for forward-thinking infrastructure planning, such as a new urban train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment against Ethiopia's government has clearly not stopped it from intensifying.
And resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by tigres, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a fraught situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the U.S. says the base has recently been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an already volatile region to collapse.
"This requires a tight balancing act," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was being sarcastic in claiming Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to pull back his words in the latest controversy to hit his campaign by insisting that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican half of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
Also getting into an awkward situation are his backers, who have to try to excuse their candidate in these tumultuous moments and explain comments he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at an election rally Wednesday night and reiterated in various interviews Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
But early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim amounted to sarcasm.
In a tweet, Trump completely reversed his speech from the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down from his claim.
The most recent storm of criticism mounted as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as approval ratings fell.
Trump and Clinton delivered their economic policy briefings in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the topic.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he faced widespread criticism when he appeared to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. He later explained his comments by saying: "Of course I was being sarcastic."
In this way, Trump is pushing the boundaries of political speech and pulling his words back when necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that elicit a response from his supporters. He watches how supporters respond to the messages, and then "clarifies" one way or another depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also think he understands his claims and knows they're all-round enough to pass through different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style to even more pungent as his approval ratings have continued to decline.
A new poll released Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal and Marist reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is firmly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But after coming under increasing scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in the awkward position of having to publicly defend Trump's comments, however provocative they may be.
One of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be justified, political speech," replied Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"That's true in the sense that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called a "lower league team" and that's why this happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, with Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it failed to deal decisively with the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday's election rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, where he accused them of dwelling on his speeches and taking a discriminatory stance against him.
He mocked the "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they cannot succeed in doing so.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying it only shows more clearly that he is not fit to be president.
Cafe, which closed due to excessive rent rises, opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a busted coffee shop in Williamsburg, where cash was the only means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe had to be priced out of its curbside spot on Bedford Avenue when the rent became exorbitant.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
Locals find this loss of a cafe that has been dodged under middle-classisation deplorable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know yes, but I still can't believe the CBGB club is no more, the Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and the Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York isn't what it used to be, it's also where new things are created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and you can pay by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unsophisticated.
The coffee is still good too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it even reintroduced the lamps of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez says he also wanted to try something new and
Added new products to the list.
Bacon-and-egg-and-cheese sandwichies and capers and browned onion rings are available for the topping.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the cafe, but juices made from fresh fruit instead.
After running a coffee shop for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed old regulars started going to Verb on a steady stream.
"Also, a lot of our old customers got priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One such is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly attended Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realised I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, although on the Sunday in question he took a chai tea blend instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a list novelty.
Another longtime customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and invariably ordered the same.
"I walked into the cafe every day at a quarter past seven, like a machine, and there they were already making my butter bagel with all the toppings," he tells me.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard produce, but occasionally he varies the bacon, egg and cheese toppings on his bagel.
Rodriguez says he bears no grudges that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which the Verb's own cold brewed coffee is used to make.
"We may yet take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez says she is now looking for a suitable place for it so her new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell the cafe's cold brew coffee.
The cafe may also expand to the adjacent building.
But for many customers, it's enough to give them their own old favourites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says he was heartbroken when the cafe closed.
When a new place opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like arriving home," says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of the cafe."
The dreary food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his Oval Office at the White House.
Known as a cultist, President Roosevelt had a penchant for the extravagant dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants like foie gras pasty and Maryland tortoise soup.
That day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a show of culinary solidarity with people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message to the American people about how they should eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, is about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in a Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and regular lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper that opened the same year as the Great Stock Market Crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, meanwhile, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was a good fit for a discussion about eating during the Great Depression.
"The morsels were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liver loaf and bean loaf.
They were made from materials that were cheap and plentiful.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to last you a whole meal.”
Andrew Coe scowls.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, particularly in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you like."
Women made food for farmworkers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the nation coped when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing talking point for Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes like morsels and casseroles became the main food, and casseroles were said to be "a great way to make the most of leftovers" because chefs could cover the not so appealing ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the centerpiece of the American meal, became a luxury used sparingly.
We tried strange blends where what mattered was the fulfilment of calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
While doing research for the book, which also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared peanut butter-filled oven onions used as a shortage dish.
"It didn't gain popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, to which
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onions don't mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as director of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget-keepers and to rise to the challenge of making tasty dishes out of pancakes like carrot cream paghetti.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historic tidbits.
Particularly palatable are accounts of state leadership's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While he publicly extolled the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce" says Coe.
"He almost ate in the gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book recounts, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste at all, the foods served at the White House were not only the dullest in Washington, but the worst prepared."
Many of the Depression-era foods were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition can still be seen in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
Writing the book, the couple say they began to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, why she couldn't throw food away.
"He was really scared of having to throw food away," says Coe.
"People even started to get sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once about wind hats."
After the main dinner plates were emptied at the Eisenberg Lunch Bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out a plum dessert they had prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt had for his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a showy name to humble recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly sank our spoons into thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe santas for the second time and the third too.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilead Receives Full Reimbursement of Attorneys' Fees for Hepatitis C Drug Patent Dispute With Merck
A U.S. regional court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for attorneys' fees it incurred in a legal dispute over a patent for the hepatitis C drug with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was acquitted in June of $200 million in damages for violating two patents owned by Merck in connection with Gilead's blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. A U.S. judge found Merck committed violations that included perjury and other unethical practices.
In the suit filed Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to an exemption from the legal fees it incurred defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat just over 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed private ownership of sofosbuvir, which is under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces have captured the city of Manbij from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have gained control of the town of Manjib, near the Turkish border, as the last Islamic State fighters left the town, according to a spokesman for the force.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) faction is now combing the city to find the last IS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the military council in Manbij, which is part of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by IS fighters had been freed.
"We have full control of the city now, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent in federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, showing that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as secretary of state, reported earning $3 million from Simon & Schuster publishing for her book about her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to lead the way on economic transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, a Clinton campaign aide, said in a statement.
In complete contrast is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and backtracks on promises to release his tax records.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns, even if they are not legally required to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have cited the IRS audit and say it's the reason Trump hasn't released his income information.
"The move is yours" tweeted Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams, citing the Democratic candidate's tax records.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special counsel, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax records until the audits were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said his refusal to release the information generates questions about Trump's equity, his grants to charity, business relationships and a host of other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has seized on that question, posting a video online Friday highlighting prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump is refusing to do what every presidential candidate for decades has done and not release his tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no or little tax for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted several tax attorneys and auditors as saying the situation may still be similar.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has advocated a provision named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30 percent tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton caucus rally in Omaha, Nebraska, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is headquartered in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffet says he too has been subject to an IRS audit and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has released tax returns through 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent in real federal taxes between 2007 and 2014 and paid an actual compound tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
It's clear from the Clintons' 2015 tax return that, unlike the majority of Americans, only $100 of their income had paychecks.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported dividend and interest income totaling $109,000.

Chili-powder-filled firecracker condoms to support elephant conservation in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements by throwing chili-powder-filled condoms at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy, has started a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Not so long ago, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to animal conservation.
"Having developed the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as now villagers can have confidence that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, says in a statement.
First, the intruding elephant is harangued by pointing a flashlight and sounding a horn.
If this doesn't work, throw in a so-called chilli cloud.
The ground chilli powder is placed in the condom together with the firecracker, and then the end of the condom is twisted shut so that only the fuse remains outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one cloud of spice is enough to drive an elephant away.
A last resort is a tosser that fires a firework known as a Roman candle into the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code at Arab "invitation" - RT News
The French, uprooted Jewish film director sparked a media furore after revealing that Berlin's Kempinski Bristol hotel does not mention Israel's area code in its list of country numbers. The hotel employee pleaded when asked for "prompts" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration at Berlin's Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
On a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries you can call directly from the room.
“How is it that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely wiped out – as if it didn’t exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option of calling Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation from the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response upset him.
The receptionist said Israel's removal from the list was "a decision carefully considered by the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the measure shocked the film director even further.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of the Israeli area code."
Interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said the incident was a "great shame."
"The incident dismays and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And it's all the more shameful when you consider that we're in Germany and it's this hotel chain.
No further explanation is required.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a response online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to alleged demands from Arab clients.
"Shame on you" was said in a batch of postings highlighting the hotel's location near a synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called what happened a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"A direct order to exclude Israel from the list of area codes was never given," writes a Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski hotel spokesman.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets in protest by Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they massed together to demonstrate against the government's reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement officers tried to disperse a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, keen to show their dismay at the government's plans.
Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin has proposed an austerity measure that will see nearly 100 public schools closed and 300,000 students placed in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on walls temporarily opposing Michel Temer, who holds the presidency.
The students' rally came just a few days after the streets filled with pro-deposed President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the sanctions were lifted, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent, according to Levan Dzhagaryan, Russia's ambassador to Iran.
He said Russian companies' interest in doing business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, growing trade further is one of the priorities in the cooperation between the two countries," Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
"Russia's exports to Iran, in particular, rose rapidly by 91.5 percent, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects that a record number of Iranian tourists will travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries in terms of tourist numbers to have its citizens travel in Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, meanwhile, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotsman Callum Skinner races to finish as Briton wins cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner rocketed to fame in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night as the Great Britain trio defended the title earned at London 2012.
Skinner, a 23-year-old from Glasgow, was the anchor role he inherited from compatriot Sir Chris Hoy of Scotland. The youngster made a legend of himself as he sped to the finish line and snatched victory from a New Zealand team regarded as favourites.
Britain claimed a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic golds.
And they repeated the trick after finishing only sixth at the Track Cycling World Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who had specialised in the role of first leader.
Hindes emerged at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end his racing career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner, from Scotland, was a man Britain's coaches believed in and saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny, who won the title with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner set an Olympic record in the time trial, but in the first round New Zealand were quicker.
And the British trio won gold in the duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round but Kenny pushed for the team lead, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy to allow Hindes to slow down in a higher gear, which allowed Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep the momentum going.
Hoy followed from his position as BBC commentator and reached the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, says: "I'm flattered by the juxtaposition.
I'm just trying to do my best and be successful.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it.'
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to deliberately falling down the track due to a poor start.
He later went back on his words and Britain's rivals had no recourse to appeal.
This time, there were no problems of this kind associated with sovereign victory.
Hindes says: "The mood was like in London, all the UK flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We've lost so many world titles, winning at the Olympics feels great.'
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the past five months, there are a successful five days in the velodrome ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in a single Olympics.
This would mean the account accruing with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on 23 March (the magic date for British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medal achievements would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and will be decided in three days' time.
Kenny, a 28-year-old from Bolton, says: "At the moment I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You get to enjoy the win with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
Hindes says: "If he wins two more gold medals, he needs to get a knighthood."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were fastest in the four-man team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set at London 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will be contested on the second day of competition today, and the focus of attention will surely be on Wiggins.
He had a dispute with race stewards yesterday ahead of the time trial when the trustees invited him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milngavie, achieved a world record time of 4:13.260.
The Great Britain team can now count on its formidable track cycling team to take charge of the mid-Olympic stage and bring the country a host of medals.
After truly extraordinary displays of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations ahead of Rio have been underestimated.
There have been back-to-back dramas, not the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of the racing careers of great athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
But the races held on the first night at the velodrome show that the UK's already legendary reputation for rising to the top at the perfect moment is being realised once again.
Future of Portland smelter at stake due to end of power contract
The future of an aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers, is at stake after a power company supplying power to the smelter said one of the plant's owners was terminating a supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This follows the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to extend subsidies to keep the plant operating.
The fixed subsidy, given for 20 years, will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are in danger of being lost at Alcoa's Portland plant.
Up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs could be at risk as a result of the closures.
The snowballing effect could continue to grow, with the smelter consuming about 10 per cent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which resulted in the Anglesea power station having to close last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures echo years of speculation about the future of the plant, first sparked by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the price of the plant's output.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that three other smelter owners will also terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp own minority stakes in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland production facility to remain operational, meaning physical power demand from the smelter will continue.
AGL describes the contracts as so-called hedging contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they expire in 2017.
"Consequently, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in FY2017," says the powerhouse.
The potential profit impact for AGL from the 2018 financial year onwards is currently limited by the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts on its books by $187m "in anticipation of contract termination."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... capabilities to keep the smelter operating or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter."
The American firm said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November this year, although it has yet to clarify why it has now backed out of the deal.
Given the weak financial state of the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates for both the smelter in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL's chief operating officer, said in a speech to analysts earlier in the week that on an annual basis Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories exit the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, it wouldn't be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality star Kendall as September Vogue cover girl
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model from the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, poses for the famous September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the promotional face of Estee Lauder and has performed at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Watching the cover in a room full of my loved ones brought me to tears," Kendall wrote.
The announcement of the cover was followed by a quirky (or maybe just following the style of the Kardashians series?), scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest) pretending to have forgotten their sister's cover. The video ends with a classic twist: they were all planning on their sister.
The plot is clichéd, and used in almost all birthday episodes of the degree shows (Seacrest utters the words, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as a children's morning TV cartoon), but Kris had to engage her other daughters in some way in this publicity.
For an appearance in Vogue's September issue marks arguably a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim might have made the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue along with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling publication of the year.
In thickness more like a large picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (fashion website Fashionista calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The announcement of a cover star for the September issue is so hotly anticipated that in the previous two years, photos from the magazine have leaked out even before the official announcement.
Previously, the September cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured celebrities doing modeling work rather than models who are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later was honored by Lady Gaga.
Jenner is described by the magazine as a model of success for her generation, and even if she’s one of the celebrities doing her job, she’s still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about these things).
They can justifiably be called talented women who excel in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career behind her when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Given her reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be fraught.
In June, Victoria's Secret original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches."
These emotions have been surfacing again as news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue emerged.
But the constant dwelling on discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
She's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks at Marc Jacobs fashion shows.
She is the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She is selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet her sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the country's most vulnerable people are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in funding will have on centres already operating at the limit.
In the state of Queensland, three out of five people are already being turned away from applying for free legal aid and legal services – the majority of whom are elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people fighting unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overburdened, are preparing for further cuts in their budgets.
From June next year, legal aid centres risk losing a further 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says the latest counting report produced by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres shows thousands of people are already being turned away from centres every year.
If the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, Farrell says, it's only going to get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are consistently underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being turned away as they seek the essential services they need," says Mr Farrell.
"People who leave abusive relationships, people who are under an unmanageable and crippling debt burden, families who are getting divorced, workers who have been wrongfully laid off – all of them have legal issues and this report shows that they are not able to get the help they need.
THE federal government plans to cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We are appealing to the Attorney-General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to drop these funding cuts immediately so people can get the legal help they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to consider the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk Government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump campaign sued for threatening employee with gun
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump's campaign after no action was supposedly taken after its leadership was told that the campaign's North Carolina director had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a Jeep in February.
The event is described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before, in his own words, he understood that this was not going to happen.
In his suit, Bordini says campaign director Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the lawsuit, after filing a complaint with the campaign's local and regional leadership, Bordini was told that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it causes damage," says Bordini in his lawsuit.
The suit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused public outrage when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of another additional clause" -- considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts -- can take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and that Trump's words did not encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for indifferent management and Phillip for assault, battery and the emotional suffering they caused.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
Despite efforts, Phillip could not be reached.
Charlotte's local news outlet WCCB reported Phillip recently dropped out of the campaign.
There was no immediate response to a call seeking comment filed with Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has waged a contentious campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow, too, is reviving the economy and creating prosperity – and not just in local communities and London, but across the country.
For me, this was the point that most interested me at Heathrow. As with the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge effort to ensure that our whole nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in areas around the airport.
As with the London Olympics in 2012, there will always be people who think Heathrow expansion is too big a challenge.
As for the Olympics, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow too.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question it is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits not the few but the many.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and grow the economy by £211 billion. It will bring skills and employment both to the area around the airport and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow who have delivered on time and on budget an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme that included the T5 terminal – voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, built in the middle of two of the world's most congested runways.
Now they are poised to produce a third runway, backed by a £16bn private investment.
The London Olympics in 2012 was a great success for our country and I am convinced there will be Heathrow expansion as well.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for Heathrow expansion to guarantee the future of our trade and create skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the board at Heathrow and a former commercial secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in an ad-blocking cat-and-mouse game
Efforts by companies that make their money from online advertising to distract from ad-blocking software have turned into a cat-and-mouse game, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it would block ad-blocking programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again block social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it was changing its desktop site's ad tagging codes to make it harder for ad-blockers to identify which parts of a page are ads.
But now Adblock says it has figured out the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of ballooning between the open-source ad-blocking community and the distracters has been going on since ad-blocking was invented" and that it's possible Facebook will make its own fix move again soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much of a concern ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use ad-blocking programs, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe. The figure has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in distracting ad-blocking programs in its desktop app, as a spokesman said mobile ad-blocking programs don't work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
Revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook found the effort worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it was updating an advertising tool in user settings to give users more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also prevent some ordinary Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we intend to resolve the issue" said a Facebook spokesperson in an email statement.
"Ad-blocking programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that's why we've invested instead in developing user settings like ad tools so people can self-control ad targeting."
Woman commits suicide by being hit by cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for the help of witnesses to an accident on a motorway in the first hours of Thursday in which a woman deliberately left herself under more than one car.
The accident happened on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate thing by lying down on a dark road, and was hit by more than one car, according to a statement from Vaud police.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her intention was clearly to commit suicide. A truck was also among the cars that ran over.
The woman died at the scene.
Police said many of the motorists involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified. Police are appealing for them or anyone else who witnessed the accident to come forward.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneve newspaper that a criminal investigation has been launched, a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether any charges will be brought against the motorists involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid the collision?
That will be left for the prosecution to sort out," says Hofstetter.
In the past five years, there have been two similar incidents that do not hold motorists accountable.
The newspaper said in each case, a person was walking in the dark on the freeway and the court ruled that motorists could not expect to bump into a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police official was cleared of a charge of manslaughter against him after a collision with a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one August night in 2014.
The tribunal heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed high levels of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The tribunal ruled that the manner in which the police – who were responding to a distress call – were driving was justified and the man lying on the road was a "totally exceptional and unforeseen situation."
Anyone with information about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been livable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been habitable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past using the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was intended to determine whether conditions on Venus might once have been similar to those on Earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless on the surface and its atmosphere is made up almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by scientists, Venus's slow spin rate can be explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-equivalent atmosphere, and it has nevertheless been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely had more arid areas than Earth, but may have had enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In GISS's modeling, Venus rotates slowly and has a daytime face toward the sun of nearly two months at a time," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain, which creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than Earth's current temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which matches previous assumptions by planetary scientists about its trajectory.
However, while Venus may have been habitable, for several billion years it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light scorched the vaporized water.
As hydrogen escaped into space, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse effect – that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modeling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his positions as coach of the Colorado Avalanche and vice president of hockey operations for the club, citing a lack of influence in team decision-making.
Colorado Executive Vice President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately begin seeking a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of hockey operations for the club with energy, passion and determination," says 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
"Over the summer I have thought long and hard about how I could improve the squad, give it the necessary depth and take it to a higher level.
For this to be achieved, the coach and the club's vice president of hockey operations must be in full alignment with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his investment in the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as head coach of the Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club got to 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and hasn't made the postseason the past two years.
The Avalanche gained 39-39-4 points in the 2015-2016 season and were held to five points by the Minnesota Wild for the second Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Roy, a Hall of Fame goaltender, won four Stanley Cups in his career – two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers begin talks and suspend strike
Chief negotiators say wage strikes by North Sea oil workers will be interrupted as all sides in the dispute take part in a new round of talks.
Strikes have been held against Wood Group, an oilfield services company, on drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
A joint statement from the two sides said: "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From early next week, we will be holding a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks to address the problems from fresh considerations.
Unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, in protest at possible pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Faced with negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut tariffs on its North Sea-based contractors by about 9 per cent this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows a 10 per cent cut in prices for onshore contractors in 20114.
The company said the additional cuts will give it the room to maneuver necessary to weather the market downturn.
Shell, meanwhile, has trimmed thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries. In doing so, it is looking to boost its operations following its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude prices and economic conditions following the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in an entire generation in the North Sea.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits the many and not just the few," says Anderson.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, down from about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures star rotation rate in Pleiades cluster
The Kepler space telescope's latest mission has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, helping astronomers compile the most comprehensive list to date of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
Based on the new data, astronomers will be able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how the orbital periods relate to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the Pasadena-based University of Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching their adult age.
They are spinning faster than ever at the moment.
At the peak of the rotational speed, large amounts of stellar wind erupt from the growing stars.
These winds have a discouraging effect on the stars as they progress through the stars' magnetic fields.
As a star ages, its rate of rotation begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest catalogued rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers – the larger ones spin more slowly than the smaller ones.
"We see from the "dance" of the Pleiades that slow-spinners are typically larger, while the fastest-spinners are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars relative to rotation rates.
"The Pleiades cluster provides a mainstay for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down and stop dancing.
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Pleiadian spin rates in three of their new papers, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
