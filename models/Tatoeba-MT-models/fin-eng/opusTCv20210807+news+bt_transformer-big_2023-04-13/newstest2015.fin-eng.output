The City of Juankoski will join the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
The City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent municipality.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will next be held in 2016.
After joining Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is about 111,000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan to meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, to discuss economic and security relations, in his first major foreign visit since winning May's election.
Modi's five-day visit to Japan is aimed at strengthening economic relations with the world's third-largest economy.
Top of the agenda are plans for expanded nuclear cooperation.
India is also said to be interested in a defence co-operation deal with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to carry out an essential political discussion with the eastern part of their country," Putin said, according to Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian military, were trying to push Ukrainian forces further away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push out these armed forces and their artillery so that they don't get a chance to shoot the residents of the area," Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaamo.
It was a surprise that the crowd arrived early in the evening.
There were visitors over the past two days as expected, promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be hip-hop festivals, so there will be no pop, Kangas assures.
On Tuesday, a law will enter into force in Finland restricting the procurement of substances suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the National Police Board for permission to buy or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as precursors for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, for example, but the concentrations in them do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane, for example, is used in acceleration.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster charged over Nairn and Pitlochry hotel rapes
A man accused of rapes at two hotels is facing trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing at Glasgow Superior Court.
He is accused of raping her at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire province on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking the woman "while she was unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision for herself."
Webster is further accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Highlands on 4 May 2014.
In line with Judge Lady Rae's ruling, the trial will take place on 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario overshadowed - Premier League - Evening News
Raheem Sterling, who is only 19, showed again why he is seen as the hope for the future of English football.
There was an electric atmosphere at White Hart Lane on Sunday as Mario Balotelli's strengthened Liverpool arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English journalists saw the 24-year-old Italian working on the pitch with a far different attitude than in Manchester City days.
Balotelli was still a long way from his cutting edge.
The Italian lost three quality goal posts and only pitched half of his sixteen passes for his own team.
Pool supporters, who have already taken the player as their favourite, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, alongside Daniel Sturridge, the team's second striker.
Instead of Balotelli, the star of the team sparkled with the tip of a midfield diamond Raheem Sterling poking the all-important opener of a 3-0 win past Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his power.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli, is between his opponent's lines like a fish in water.
The feature is not common for a player who speeds on grass at his best speed of about 34 kilometres per hour.
Rodgers, too, deserves high praise for Sterling's development.
The Northern Irishman spoke after the match about how Liverpool have systematically developed the North West Londoner, who grew up at the foot of Wembley, into a more holistic player than a mere wing-runner.
Susanna Mälkki appointed Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The City Board of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Newspapers as far away as the Los Angeles Times have been asking which orchestra he'll take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in Finland’s music scene for more than a hundred years, for example by performing a large amount of Sibelius’s music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra in the past.
I look forward to our future collaboration," he says.
Administrations of employee organisations to meet in pension negotiations - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus for pension negotiations is being sought today from the labour market organisations' own gatherings.
The administration of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiations in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
Among other things, labour market organisations have been chafed by the controversy over tying the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be created this week.
Pliers.
Woman Volley, a women's volleyball team from Rovaniemi, tripped over league riser Vampula's Athletes Pihtiputta in the final of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula skewed a match stretching back to five sets to win 3-2.
WoVo lost the final set 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defensive game and the passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
WoVo's six was risible in that 6-foot-4 American center Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the sideline.
The player was Sara Niemi.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and formed the most firepowerful combination in WoVo with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the final 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was the skilful Russian passer and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparations for the league will continue next week when Hämeenlinna HPK comes to a training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will face off Saturday in a "bargain" at 6 p.m. in an official practice game.
We will meet again on Sunday at the sports academy.
Lidl beats wild numbers in Finland
The net sales of the company’s stores in Finland increased by almost 25 per cent to nearly EUR 1.2 billion during the financial year ended at the end of February.
The company released its earnings results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland and plans to continue the expansion.
Lidl also reported that it paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer deaths more often in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and complicated access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at greater risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 per cent of women lived beyond five years after diagnosis.
Principal investigator Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and far-flung areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL RESEARCH: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed the women's health histories over a seven-year period.
Dr Susan Jordan said the woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous medical conditions and socioeconomic status also affected the chance of survival.
Among older women and with cancer more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the odds of survival were lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not try to determine why women who live outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan attributes delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment to possible causes.
"Specialists in gynecological oncology treat this disease best, and their appointments are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote treatments are becoming more common and less important, the researcher suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients who are being treated far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, long-term survival rates for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are poor, regardless of geographic location, underscoring the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The research, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charity, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old Gold Coast housewife Elisha Neave was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the town plan for toboggan parking in Friendship Park, which is located next to Hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the town plan proposal for Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be placed on public display at the Osviittaa service point.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environment Board and Lapland Ely Centre.
With the city plan change, the city wants to enable the continuation of tourism-related snowmobiling activities in the area.
An area of parkland is to be formed on the site, which will contain the area between the existing Friendship Park and it and the river.
A maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between November 15 and April 30, according to the proposal.
Refuelling points may also be located in the area.
Maintenance traffic will also be allowed on the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
Sled parking and a change in the pattern have provoked even loud opposition.
Residents of neighbouring apartment blocks have been snarled at the sound as well as worried about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated, and the reports have not revealed any findings exceeding the guide values.
The new equipment is also lower than the old ones.
The friendship park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure point were to be moved further away, the hotel’s safari customers would have to be transported to the safari departure points by buses, with an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area around the Friendship Park is also large enough for sleds, which is better than the places presented as replacements, such as the boat pier on the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The Friendship Park is also good in terms of its location, so that activities can expand to the Ounaspaviljonki area in the future.
The consolidation of parking is part of the City Strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the City’s objective is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by reserving sufficient high-quality areas for logistically and operationally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as a starting point for snowmobiling in the city centre's part master plan, which has not yet been given legal force.
Fall in owner-occupied homes seen in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, particularly in the under-35s group, may lead to garden stores" turnover falling by tens of millions as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" for garden sales by age. The Financial Times reported on the study by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) in the UK.
According to a report in the Financial Times, apartment renters spend only 55 per cent of the amount of money that homeowners spend on gardening.
The study had also revealed that more people are living in highly urbanised flats with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is shrinking as the forecourt is increasingly paved over as a parking space. These factors, too, threaten the horticultural sector, which is estimated to be worth around £5bn a year.
In the greater London area, home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, with the lowest amount of money spent per household on horticultural products across the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Horticultural Association (RHS), an increase in house rentals or a reduction in garden size does not mean people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the RHS's lead horticultural adviser, says that "plants grown in portable grow containers, for example, are particularly popular with apartment landlords because such grow containers can be included in the move if necessary."
According to the HTA report, 1997-2005 was a boom year for resale in the horticultural sector, as home ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year thanks to better weather, after poorer weather in March and April last year.
Turkey questions U.S. diplomat over spy report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to give an account of a report on spying in Turkey by Americans and Britons.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Embassy chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) analyst Edward Snowden reveal Turkey was the main spy target for US and UK intelligence agencies.
Turkish news agencies said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the significance of the report, saying all major nations have spied on each other.
A previous report of spying on Ankara by Germany's main intelligence agency prompted an angrier reaction from the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who has appeared in several blockbuster films, is attached to the female lead in the new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 Nights into the Morning, which opens filming this week in Lithuania.
Croze won Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival for her role in "The Barbarian Invasion" in 2003.
He has appeared in films such as Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's Butterfly in a Glass Dome.
Two Nights in the Morning is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorca Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Those who gave evidence in the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and Calvià city government officials at the Majorca public prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, on the resort island of Majorca, has been arrested following allegations of corruption made by business and bar owners in the Magaluf region known for wet partying.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several shop owners in Punta Ballena filed corruption charges against him. Punta Ballena is home to most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who came forward with the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and Calvià city government officials at Mallorca's Office of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The nationwide daily ABC wrote that nightclub owners were angered by the authorities’ bias, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," one business owner told the court.
You won't destroy our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was a newspaper headline in several countries this summer after a YouTube video circulated online showing an 18-year-old British holidaymaker performing oral sex on 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Ever since, the island's authorities have tried to curb the intoxicated and uncontrolled behaviour of Magaluf holidaymakers by shrinking the number of participants in the notorious, alcohol-fuelled pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub where the oral sex video was filmed was ordered closed for a year, and Carnage, the nightclub owner and pub crawl organiser, was jointly fined €55,000.
Above all, the so-called balconing trend has also become popular among young British tourists in the tourist destination of Magaluf, which has caused a number of accidents caused by alcohol consumption as people have jumped from one balcony to another or from balcony to hotel swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombarded their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the territory recovered from fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed southern Israeli communities, but the trail of fighting is still visible.
In Pashosh kindergarten in the southern city of Ashdod, workers removed traces of shrapnel from walls and slides before children arrived after a rocket struck the kindergarten.
"We're a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
For Shani Bart, Bart's 11-year-old daughter, going back to school after a long time feels "a little weird."
"We've had tough times at times where we didn't go anywhere from home," she says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before last week's cease-fire began, thousands of residents in border-area communities like Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas farther from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are skeptical about returning after a Palestinian shell killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
The Department for Education said just over ten families had not yet returned.
Children from these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border that was the target of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "education and safety of children will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring resolution to many key issues, including Hamas' demand to lift the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and reopen Gaza's air and sea routes.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
According to Palestinian and U.N. estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the number of dead, saying at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has had no conclusive evidence of this.
Sixty-six soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south in the fighting.
The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli strikes damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took shelter in more than 100 U.N.-run schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting continuing, school officials postponed the start of school the previous week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will be able to go to school again, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a shelter in Gaza City.
According to a commonly used measure, house prices have risen by the largest amount in seven years during Australia's winter months.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic house price index, which measures house prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, RP data showed on Monday.
The rise came as prices rose by a total of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, more than in the same months after 2007.
The year-on-year increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice what it was in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not been rising steadily across the country.
According to RP Data research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are tipped to see price rises.
RP Data results show that house prices rose 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne in the previous year.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is the next busiest; the average for price rises is five to six per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose just 1.4 per cent in a year as a result of government spending cuts.
Mr Lawless said the spring in Australia will increase the number of homes for sale over the coming months, which will be a real test for the housing market.
"Given the surge in sales of homes up for auction, the generally buoyant pace of sales and the continuing low level of interest rates, it is likely that house price growth will continue over the next three months," Mr Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual art have drawn record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
The Serlachius Art Museum has received more than 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
On Monday, Mänttä Art Festival reported that it had set a visitor record with 14,500 visitors to the Wait a Minute event this summer.
We are not used to such numbers.
People have been lapped through doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to Serlachius Museums this year will be close to 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Midway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, Mänttä-Vilppula has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen points out that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In fact, Mänttä hopes the art season will continue well beyond the summer.
In the autumn, the museum opens new exhibitions.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in recent days.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into by breaking a window.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel from a truck tank had been stolen on Syväojankatu.
Between Sunday and Monday, a boat with outboard engines had been taken from the marina in Petäisenniska.
The rowing boat was Kalapalta-branded light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, the text "OIVA" was written on the spout.
A couple of suspected thieves were already caught by the police.
On Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into.
A police dog was tracked down and a Paltamo man in his 20s was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, police nabbed another man from Paltamo who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brought murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
Prosecutors said the man had gone to the apartment with his common-law spouse and another man and fired a shotgun at the owner of the apartment he suspected was a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed the other man with him was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car in which an entourage was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burned clothing shreds, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a judgment in the case at a later date.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, a similarly warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the entire summer was recorded in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a family of seven immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in the British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked in a factory and died when Henry was 19. The relationship between son and father was distant.
Henry is currently training for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, based in part on an imaginary conversation he had with his father and developed based on a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at an upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy several times since her mother's death, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already grown when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed things like the shape of a pint of beer or the beauty of cricket batting.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelting plant in Dudley and thus gained an insight into what his father's life must have been like, albeit with better working conditions today than at the time.
The smelters are a little brighter these days, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthine depths, bursting with flames, smoke, and soot, reminiscent of the underworld.
My father used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the smelter's dirt off himself.
Walking around the smelter, I realized that he had been working for years to get us food on the table, and I came to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the intimacy that parents offered.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started feeling sick shortly before she died that we started repeating to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep repeating "I love you"?
Stop hugging me! Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother
Henry remains good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to my mother's death.
When I began to suffer from excessive obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to do a turnaround.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps illustrates his transformation during his career development.
Having received a lot of good feedback from critics for his role as Othello, he is immersed in theatre-making.
Next up were Comedy of Errors and August Wilson's Fences ("Fences").
Theatre-making offers a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was just a 16-year-old factory worker.
A disc jockey spotted him on stage doing impersonations and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-'70s. "For quite a while I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he tells me.
Henry learned while working.
I had to grow up in the publicity spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living stardom and being on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny at the New Faces talent show in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show in which individuals appeared wearing black makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Even though my position was strange and objectionable, I got to work on huge events and learn how to deal with audiences.
Yet "British TV's award-winning, perennial favourite and light entertainment show" was at once "a grotesque parody of black people."
In the Eighties, Henry worked on another comedy show that both poked fun at and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade working on commercials, documentaries, TV series and film parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv series aired on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just treading still or going sideways".
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...?"
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class who wear tights and have money.
That's why the Shakespeare subject struck me as fearsome.
Everyone we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, “Try it.
Don't dismiss the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Date the words and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do this.
It almost felt as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months, before it was carried out.
In the end, the play was a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that didn't quite happen.
Soon after, Henry played the lead in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was acting at the British National Theatre and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point the thought occurred to me: 'Oops, you've changed'.
Once the play had technical problems, and Henry clearly felt it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You've got to make do with 10 minutes on your own until the computer works again.' "
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked off the stage, and part of me breathed a sigh of relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role"
Henry in "Fences" at Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for the "Fences" play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play, too, was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
Henry, of course, says this in a GREAT voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
But Henry is still essentially a comedian: little bits of humour constantly interrupt our conversation as he switches from one impersonation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as receiving immediate thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general it doesn't excite me the way it used to.
I ask Henry if he plans to go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real pleasure to sit down with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really fun.
When you're acting, you're constantly telling a story, and that's a task I thrive on.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya draws up register of officials to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun drawing up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government payroll.
Employees who did not register with the registry in the next two weeks would receive no more pay, a government statement indicated.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they leave their civil service jobs.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to root out public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, at least $1 million was spent on "ghost workers" wages and other financial irregularities in the month.
The government suspects salaries are being paid into the account even after a person has died or left their civil service post, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants will be required to declare themselves on the register within the next few weeks at identification centres to ensure that their details are stored in a biometric registration format, a government statement said.
Anyone who fails to do this without due cause will be removed from the payroll, according to the release.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector because this is how to determine how many lives actually function in their positions. In addition, this is how to purge payrolls at both levels of government. This is how to solve the problem of "ghost workers,"" says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official in the Department of Decentralisation and Planning.
Seinäjoki’s result for the financial year 2015 may be in deficit by EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditures in a tense economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about to fall to a deficit of 9.4 million.
Possible means of efficiency improvement included compromising the scope and level of services, as well as purchases of services, asset sales and grants, as well as increasing tax and payment revenue.
Of the EUR 10 million qualifying target, EUR 8.5 million is in size.
There is no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and a 5% cut in central government transfers further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the seminar is to find new ways to rebalance the economy.
The city council is unanimous in its view that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned around in line with the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the submitted proposals to the Executive Committee for preparation.
The City Board's proposals will form the basis for budget preparation at the council's financial seminar in Frami on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal will proceed through the board proceedings to the city government and city council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for alleged 'plots' against government
In all, 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
Police officials had no immediate comment.
The Hurriyet Daily News said 14 senior police officials were among those arrested.
Some police officers were linked to last December's corruption investigations targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing an extensive crime spree and following telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister during the period in question) said the police actions were part of a planned action against him and others in power by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a momentous day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told waiting reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September ceremonies were not celebrated at every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, all of the huge Ukrainian front must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at the Slaviansk school where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
Celebrations on the first day of school traditionally include children's embroidered shirts, balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas' Perry says defamatory tweet was unauthorized
A defamatory photo of a Democratic district attorney was sent from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's verified Twitter account on Sunday night amid allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet in which Perry vowed to have nothing to do with the photo.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I disapprove of the tweet and have deleted it," a later release said.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
While the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a defamatory cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's post when she refused to step down, leading to a grand jury gathering in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The tweet's headline read: 'I don't always drive drunk, three times the allowed percentages... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger'.
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's agency did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio who was assigned the job by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the allegations a political ploy.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the allegations and said the law on which Texas' longest-serving governor is being prosecuted is unclear when mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to the state's Public Inviolability Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector allegations, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted the left-leaning monitoring group to issue a formal complaint on the issue.
Perry's verified Twitter account is updated regularly – and, at times, famously.
After finishing in fifth place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry gushed about ending the tie by posting a photo on Twitter of himself jogging on a lake with the caption, "Here we come, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says housing market is back to 'normal'
One of London's main developers has warned that the housing market in the south-east of England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Housing in London, the capital, has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price rises while fears of a widespread credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of Berkeley, a high-end developer, said on Monday that "since the start of the current economic year, the market and the number of deals have returned to normal after the spike in 2013" and added that this has allowed for a "stable operating environment."
London's housing market was doing well during the recession as foreign investors sought to flock to the capital.
Land Registry data showed that house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, and so far exceeded the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
Average sale prices for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about a fifth on the previous year, reaching a £423,000 price rise by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London property a less attractive target in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "mansion tax" ahead of the May general election.
Foxtons, the London-based estate agent, warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported tighter lending regulations, would lead to lower levels of market growth, both in terms of property sales volumes and prices, in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of loans approved fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Estate agent Hamptons International has downgraded its 2015 forecast for London property prices. It says prices will fall by three per cent because an index measuring homeowners' opinion on prices has already started to deteriorate.
The number of completed deals in the most expensive areas of London, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has dropped by a quarter year-on-year, according to WA Ellis, the estate agent.
However, demand for homes in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, which increased revenues from properties sold to more than £2.2bn.
Mr Pidgley added that "demand for a well-designed, right kind of product in the best locations has remained stable, and consequently sales have remained buoyant."
In June, the company said it sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April. This is nearly a third more than at the time of the pre-economic crisis peak in 2007.
Year-on-year annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, taking the total to £380m and revenue increased by 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
Pidgley told reporters Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for the year are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that full-year pre-tax profits will be £450m.
Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at £23.96.
Hacker leaks Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to hold photos of 100 other stars leaked nude photos of Oscar actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A rep for the "Hunger Games" star confirmed that the photos are authentic and condemned the hacker for a "rude invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be hit with the allegations.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo posting page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to a weakness in Apple's iCloud storage system. A hundred other stars targeted by the hack are alleged to have dozens of other female stars on the list, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those watching the photos taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: hope you're feeling good," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the photos and tweeted that "these so-called nudes of me are FAKE, don't you understand."
Let me finish this right off the bat.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that a representative for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of photos of the star.
Only we have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "j"
They dissolved, it best described what happened, gradually they came loose from each other like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from her that he was too serious, too painstaking, too intense, too detached, and perhaps a little prickly.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the thorn.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his barbs had, in the early stages, been a relationship that had nevertheless been promising; it had seemed that this relationship might have eased his lonely boredom, and it might perhaps have even brought some substance to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north that was even rougher and further away from it all than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern supposed to be his aunt. Her aunt had inherited a house in a damp but paradisaic valley, which was appropriately called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
Pipes were leaking, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, snails had left their mark on the windows, holding the whole place as their own, weeds were growing in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like a children's fairy tale, threatening and magical at the same time, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
Nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand-in-hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair amid the long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening absent-mindedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and reassuring news, as Ailinn's crossed, sun-tanned legs brought Kevern to mind a song that had been sung by a long-forgotten black performer below, and which his father had often listened to.
Your leg is too big.
Songs like that were basically too aggressive, and they weren't played on the receiver anymore.
They weren't banned – nothing really was banned – they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to leave them behind, just like the word itself.
Public opinion accomplished what laws and anathema had failed to achieve: just as in literature people chose to read heroes' memoirs, cookbooks and romances, in music they preferred ballads.
Rewilded by the day, Kevern began strumming an imaginary piano and singing serenades to Ailinn's big feet in a brazenly comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally raising two fingers to his mouth.
This is what his father had always done, before the letter "j" escaped his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you let out a word starting with "j" and didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't one now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
The Jazz hadn't exactly been outlawed either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one if word in life.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a cleverness performed through music.
Although by the age of 10 Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that she could not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its components gratefully accepted – gratefully, as if saved by luck – the principle that each group did things inherent in it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people of Afro-Caribbean descent were best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, they were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure every family had a working phone to use to run errands.
Those remaining from the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, those from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly for fear of being blamed for the blaze and fearing that the flames would next reach them, opened restaurants that served labneh yogurt and burned water.
Let each act according to his gifts.
Ailinn had heard only ballads, and found it hard to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung could ever be dressed up as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except, perhaps, for the Bigfoots.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
Not a single word would pass through the soundproofing of the leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers to his lips in Ailinn's company.
Ailinn thought he was weird even now.
"It was amusing to my dad," he said instead.
Ailinn shook her head in disbelief, and her hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing to see in the whole world but Ailinn's huge, crow-black hair litter.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren’t really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to rectify the situation.
I'm warped in that sense.
This didn't help.
He had wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her terrace chair and, in the process, knocked over the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
Even the wine was made only of elderflowers, so he could not use it as a reason for colliding.
Nervous, he seemed to shake, like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your thick head is what perversely attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unnecessarily cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he was going to hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the frigid northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that, fundamentally, it had been like life here.
The same huge, frigid sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and fiendier after the event than their smuggler and smasher grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to smack any woman who would dare resist or tease them.
Thick head?
If he wasn't careful, he'd see a fat fist again!
Suck first – kissing had become the most common word used to describe the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver – suck first and then attack.
Kevern felt that was too much, too, as the act of vacuuming itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged her to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief took her by surprise.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go – just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through an upstairs window – a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
Turned back, bowed, ashamed, defeated man who had lost all will to fight – why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember ever having seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the event, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher at Ofnow, a private institution that measures public opinion, made a brief study of the continuation of low- and medium-intensity violence in those areas of the country where a reduction, or even an end, to violence was most likely, given the money and energy expended to eradicate it.
"Much has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "to offset the inherent aggressiveness of a people who have fought and most often won for thousands of years, especially in those abandoned and remote corners where, despite the towering church towers over hedgerows, human gentleness has rarely been known over the ages.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The taller the tower, the lower the appetites it generates.
The people weep among sentimental ballads, devour tales of vanquished adversity and swear by the virtues of married and family life, but at the same time old-fashioned cruelty keeps an unremitting grip on both rural communities and urban cohabitation areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more ill-tempered will to argue in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her gaze to the ground.
Also, I have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"To believe I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme further invoked its right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Silence once again.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain kind of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can at times lead to distorted outcomes, such as the ones you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church – and what you call cruelty or evil-souledness, others tend to call inherent energy and physical intensity.
Saying WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light proclaimed an instruction that Ofnow had been dispensing to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, and a sung word is better than a written one, but nothing beats love.
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a hushed voice when she was sure her director had quit, "and I just want to say that we're not as effectively cured as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF HAPPENED.
This time, though, we don't pour out our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "in describing as 'mistakes' those actions that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their 'hatred and distrust on others'."
Someone in a position like yours shouldn't have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we don't talk about 'us' or 'them.'
There was no ‘us’ or ‘other’.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are quite honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group in society can say they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
We don’t need to talk about it anymore – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to spread accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they are warranted or not, and even if there is some way to do them.
But what's the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go through your report," he said, expressing that it was time for Esme to go.
The next day, as he went to work as normal, he was hit by a motorcyclist riding on the pavement, a ride described by passers-by as "evil-minded and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army denies planning attack; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho army officials have denied staging the attack to overthrow the government and said they were acting against police who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the military had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The head of state travelled with his family to neighbouring South Africa after being told he had received a death threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said that the military was thus responding to a threat from "political fanatics." Police have been said to have been trying to arm the fanatics.
"The Lesotho Defence Force took action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that certain elements of the police force are trying to arm young party fanatics as they are prepared to cause trouble," he told the Voice of America news agency.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions looked like an attempted revolution.
"While no body has claimed to have subverted the government by force, the actions of Lesotho's defence forces seem in all respects to match the hallmarks of an attempted revolution," he says.
Lesotho army officials said soldiers were returning to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a sense of calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of the action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have emerged in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions over differences in the grand coalition government.
He denies thus belittling the power of government, despite claims to the contrary.
Microsoft to set up data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, a location the company refuses to specify.
In a press release sent to media outlets by Microsoft, the company said it would not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
Microsoft says the center is already fully equipped as well as connected to the network.
It's an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been chosen as the location of the centre.
Microsoft is closing its Oulu office, which will take about 500 people out of their jobs.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company would not comment on how many employees the new data center would employ.
The creation of the data centre in Uusimaa was reported by Kauppalehti on Monday.
Man accused of running over girl at traffic light crossing
A 78-year-old man has been charged with running over a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of running over the girl at an intersection in Pittenween in the eastern Neuk.
Prosecutors say Stewart drove his Audi Q3 carelessly and caused injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges at a Dundee Sheriff Court hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or video underwater, you have a variety of devices to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I personally took these photos at a family celebration using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are sealed waterproof.
In addition, set the camera's shooting settings to match the images or video being taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize shooting conditions underwater.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can only handle depths of 5 feet, others as deep as 50 to 60 feet.
Check out both regular and waterproof models in our buying guide and reviews of digital cameras.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD screen that allows you to compose a picture, while action cameras often don't have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see underwater, and you can either succeed or fail to make a picture.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forking, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly at a deeper depth.
If possible, stay close to the surface when photographing in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This way you also get more colors in your pictures; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you see.
Try to get close to the subject.
This is an important piece of advice when filming on land, but even more important underwater because light conditions are scarce.
This is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning that the photographer needs to be close to the subject in order for the subject to fill the whole picture down to the frames.
China refuses to let Hong Kong choose its leaders; protesters vow revenge
BEIJING (AP) - China's parliament decided Sunday that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 election despite growing unrest demanding democratic reform.
The decision is likely to provide a spark for the long-awaited protests on Hong Kong's business quarter after activists began planning and enforcing demonstrations just hours after the decision was published.
The decision by China's National People's Congress effectively gives the Communists the power to weed out any candidate who disobeys Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," says the Democratic Party's chairwoman, lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Chinese People's Congress committee, defended China's rule, saying that a general stand-off when choosing Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when the UK handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the territory that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders say Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the ruling also makes clear that China wants to tightly control the electoral process through an appointments committee administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most high-profile protests in the region in years.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business world block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central movement gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
At the rally, the movement's organizers announced that the movement was entering a new era of civil disobedience and they would generate waves of protest in the coming weeks.
But they gave no details, apparently fearing it would lead to problems with authorities.
In a release posted online, organizers said the movement "views the Occupy Central stunt as a last resort that will only be introduced if there is no hope for dialogue and no other path."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last chance for dialogue has been missed and the takeover of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security was tight near the main government buildings. Among those present were police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, the unrest is fueled by a sense among many that residents are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s lifeblood – the business world.
"The protest they're talking about could lead to big economic losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it lasts," says lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want concerns to spread that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There have also been reports in Chinese state media that democracy activists in Hong Kong are the henchmen of Western powers fomenting the revolution."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy protests in the region.
US prom tradition hits UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing the UK's first form of luxury travel for today's students.
The company offers not only a private jet but also other means of transport such as a Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the most memorable arrival for the customer at the university.
Stewart said there is also a safety aspect to the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise drag their possessions across the country in cars loaded to the brim.
When combined with the many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer today's students the easiest and highest quality transportation possible to college.
According to a company representative, no bookings have yet been received as the service has only just been set up, but added that "students will start placing orders over the next few weeks."
The company believes there is demand for the service, despite most students paying £9,000 tuition fees.
Today's students are very different in terms of their expectations and aspirations from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now more than ever, it's important to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
But the national student organization criticized the service as not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's higher education section, "this service plan seems really far removed from the lives of the student majority."
Many people starting their studies this month will be shocked by the level of living expenses as the financial supports on offer in the form of loans and grants have lagged behind the staggering rise in basic living costs. Only next can we begin to think about where we could find thousands to spend on something as simple as coming to campus.
Ipswich 'pig house' for sale
Estate agents removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk after discovering a large pig lying in the living room of the house in the picture.
The one-bedroom house, priced at £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The advert included a picture of the living room with a pig leaning its head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells says the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the image ended up in the advert by mistake, and has since been removed," a company representative says.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom house."
Although the estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has sparked interest on social media, where questions have been raised about whether the pig is included in the house price.
Torres departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
The departure of Spain striker Fernando Torres from Chelsea was confirmed but a replacement stepped in with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea announced they had signed French tip Loic Remy from neighbouring club QPR on a four-year deal.
The purchase price is 13 million euros, according to press reports.
Torres, 30, is moving to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool for a record £50m four years ago but never lived up to expectations.
Also coming to a decision was Japanese player Shinji Kagawa's unsuccessful outing for Manchester United.
Kagawa is expected to return to Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his ManU move.
According to press reports, the purchase price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's recent contract is for four years.
I wanted to make my dream a reality in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be a Dortmund man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment," Kagawa said.
Another Bundesliga club, Berlin's Hertha, is getting stronger with Salomon Kalou.
The Ivory Coast national team striker will move to Hertha from French club Lille, with a transfer estimated at around €3m.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played from 2006-12 at Chelsea.

Our whole house was moving: we were shaking with fear.
The explosion was so powerful our ears were ringing," described Maryline Yyvon, who lives next door to the crash site.
Emergency shelters were already set up at a nearby school for residents of the house on Sunday.

Bulgarian Prison Staff Hold National Protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the justice ministry in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
Pay rises are also due to be discussed with Hristo Ivanov, the interim justice minister.
For a month now, prison officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite a meeting between representatives of the Prison Workers' Association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest by the Prison Workers Association is also expected to be joined by members of the Home Office Employees Trade Union.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin nearly fainted on court
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his pitch-black USA match and walloped Ukraine's second-half blood with his stoppage-time decisions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans - and did it in style:
I almost fainted on the pitch at the end, that encouragement was so great.
In his eyes, he couldn’t do anything.
That noise and the sea of white audiences was almost too much for me.
Salin's moments of power held nine pinnacles at a rapid pace, with ball possession, disc jockeys and trickery everywhere where it happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into such a flow state that it all worked out.
They come from somewhere, now to a very important place, Sasu glowed.
That's my role.
To do all that.
Now it was great to see that others caught up with the plot, too.
It caught up with the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joy-pill and spirit-creator, so it's no wonder his example put the whole team on a flight that was too much for the big and heavy-handed Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years: The previous ones reminded me of the outrageous refereeing game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 World Cup tournament in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men’s volleyball team last played in a World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-rounder.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing from the tournament like it was yesterday: it was a scalding match against France in the early going.
"In the deciding balls of that match, the umpire game was blatant," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the backline.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that the pasmas went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world champions as Poland's World Cup tournament gets underway today on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The power values of the players are about the same as they used to be, but there is more quality and skill now.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is faster,” Parkkali thought.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded, and the strain can be shared.
I look forward to seeing Finland from the beginning.
Then it can get tight," reckons Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were on the attack in the win against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was an all-rounder in the World Cup tournament.
Let's hope that we now edge up to 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust," said Parkkali.
Sports legend Reino Kosonen was the national team's second coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö played in the Tunisia match.
The sauna and evening worship at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the World Cup tournament in 1982.

Finnish tourists rescue Cita the dog from a mountain in Norway: 'These men deserve all the thanks'
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
At the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook so he could thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday hurt his paw.
The injured dog could no longer walk on the steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself but I didn't succeed so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to coax and pull it forward a bit, but its legs just didn't carry," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said there was no help from police, a nearby hotel or passers-by.
By nightfall, the situation was beginning to look menacing.
Luckily, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had been visiting Norway's highest mountain, Galdhøpiggen, and were heading to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was comparatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help her with the dog, Antti Soini says in a message to Ilta-Sanomat.
Soon, a German man with an excursion mattress also happened to arrive.
From the mattress to the Cita, we got stretcher-like ones to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came a moment after us, when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in his arms down the slope for a while, Soini says.
PHOTO: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of an expedition mattress.
Soini said the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought all the way down.
After the incident, Mikkelsen was still searching for "international heroes" on Facebook so he could thank them once more.
In fact, the chords responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't necessarily have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the thanks and credit, I am eternally grateful to them.
By mid-morning, the sound was on its way home.
They were happy to hear from Mikkelsen: - Cita is feeling better!

Genetic anomaly is often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
For most of her youth, Karin Rodgers thought she had only a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
What he really suffered from was Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). That means a host of inherited diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charity CMT UK says misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, a disease that causes symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, awkward walking and toe clumping.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse as time goes on.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's Ataxia (FA), which has a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be confined to a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two says that "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and took longer than everyone else.
I was never able to roller-skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school for walking and running differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13, he underwent several operations on his Achilles tendon to straighten his legs. When he underwent surgery after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers, which said he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home I checked the information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she tells me.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the time I was 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the time he was 17 his stated that his gait had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said 'girl darling, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair'.
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they explained to me what CMT disease was, I thought I'd been put off," she tells me.
Charity CMT UK organises CMT Month to draw attention to the disease.
100 migrants found in coal wagon in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a train carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles in central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they are going," said Ivo Koteski, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
Police said the migrants had paid around €3,000 each to enter Greece, with a further €800 to €900 to enter Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia, a country of a couple of million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled Syria's bloody civil war.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai back Scottish independence
Pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined supporters of Scottish independence.
The Guardian newspaper says the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on 18 September.
In his announcement, Mogwai said the vote is an opportunity for Scots that only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, actor Sean Connery, among others, has given his support to independence.
Instead, for example, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to Scottish people to remain part of the UK.
In Gallup, supporters of independence have been at a loss.
The difficulties of department stores continued in mid-summer - Domestic News - Ilta-Sanomat
The decline in department store trade also continued in July, according to the Grocery Trade Association.
It said revenue at department store and hypermarket chains was 3.2 per cent lower in July than a year earlier.
Sales of home and leisure products have been the worst affected, with revenue down more than seven percent from a year ago.
The sales of clothing products were also clearly weaker than in the previous summer.
In contrast, the value of retail sales of daily consumer goods grew by nearly three per cent in July from one year ago.
Sales increased most in small stores and large supermarkets.
Throughout the first half of the year, i.e. January to July, the turnover of department stores and hypermarkets has contracted by more than two per cent.
By contrast, sales of groceries are up nearly 1 percent.
Joan Rivers' family 'hopes for the best'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was brought to a central New York hospital, but her daughter was hopeful today that the 81-year-old comedian will be cured of her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers wrote today.
We hope for the best.
His mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday for a cardiac arrest. Sources said the then-treatment site, the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in the Upper East Side, reported the emergency to the hospital.
Doctors are deliberately keeping him sedated with the help of drugs and will monitor his condition closely until his currently serious condition is stable again.
The case has caused widespread reaction in the public, with Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa, for example, offering support online.
Areva-Siemens: Olkiluoto reactor 3 to be completed in mid-2016
Areva has submitted an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima.
According to Areva’s statement, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the fact that approval has been sought for the reactor’s automation systems.
The project is already years overdue.
In May, TVO did not provide any estimate for the completion time of reactor three.
Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to Bottas - value around 60,000 euros
The Nastola municipal government donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to Formula driver Valtteri Bottas from the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
The local government showed a fair sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel noises at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syurakki.
The Bottas gift plot has farm buildings - seven in all.
The county will still take them out this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure home on the property within two years.
We are honored that he has enjoyed his birth and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to talk about his sports career and life.
Hopefully it will continue, the mayor said.
The local authority estimates the value of the waterfront plot at between €40,000 and €60,000.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Over the decades, with varying degrees of success, Nastola has kept those who have succeeded in sports through gift plots in the municipality.
World Spear Throw champion Aki Parviainen and world aerobics champion Tuuli Matinsalo got their own plots from the municipality and built their own houses.
But they didn't stay in Nastola and instead sold their properties and moved out.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved after the life situation changed elsewhere.
Bottas is a native Nastola native and his situation is different, Syurakki inches and believes Bottas will stay in his home municipality.
Hull sign striker Hernandez for club record sum
Premier League club Hull invested a club record sum in the acquisition of Uruguay national team man Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch to Hull from Italian club Palermo for £9.5m, or around €12m.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season as Palermo won Serie B to take the lead in Italy.
For the Uruguayan national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
At last summer's World Cup finals, Hernandez came on as a substitute in two games.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short space of time," said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said they had also acquired Senegal national captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russian space experiment fails after geckos sent on sex trip die
The five little geckos sent into space by Russia to breed have died, the Russian Federation's space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
The geckos traveled aboard the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning.
The experiment was designed to study the reproductive capacity and behaviour of geckos in a weightless state.
The experiment involved one male gecko and four females.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
Through effects on geckos, one can try to anticipate the effects that weightlessness would have on a person during their longer stay in a similar state, illustrated the New Statesman in July.
Roscosmos said the time and cause or causes of death of the geckos will be determined.
According to news agency Interfax, passengers christened "sex geckos" froze.
Another surprise is that the fruit flies that travelled with the same Foton-M4 survived the trip without difficulty and also had offspring.
France arrests terror suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
The 22-year-old is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group based in Syria.
The French authorities said on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track down the man after he allegedly lured a 16-year-old girl to Syria with money.
The girl was due to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions and told authorities the family had no family in Turkey.
The man is from Chechnya, according to authorities, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had been monitoring the man's actions before.
In France, officials have been concerned that radicalizing youth attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria also pose a security risk for France.
Officials estimate that about 800 French citizens or those enrolled in France have traveled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The national basketball team's hopes of a further place are in play when Finland face Ukraine in their second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine is one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary victories.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen anticipates.
Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 on Saturday in their first game of the Games.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world 100m champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter kicked 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against guys like that before and we need to get our standards defense right,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in yesterday’s loss to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that you will see a normal pack of wolves on the pitch, Möttölä said.
Alleged Hollywood star's nude photos go viral, some verified as real
A slew of nude photos purportedly featuring well-known public figures are spreading on the Internet.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "naked photo campaign."
Entertainment website TMZ has published an angry comment issued by Lawrence's representatives that would appear to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone posting (on the Internet) stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted," the reps threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos being circulated of her are genuine.
She took these pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing those images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine the creepy effort that went into this.
I sympathize with everyone who was a victim of hacking," he writes, according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice says the photos, which go by her own name, are fake.
Real or fake nude photos are also circulating of at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalie criticises his own: 'Not working hard enough to get out of here'
Football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS game illustrate well the confusing current situation at the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the 1-2 loss ended in a struggle.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
He was not a bad defensive player.
The player traffic in Honga has been brisk this summer, which is also why the defenders in front of Viitala have changed at a fast pace.
With player roulette, too, many young players have been given opportunities they might not even deserve.
"Some of them don't work hard enough to ever get out of here," Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga's head coach, Shefki Kuqi, somewhat agreed with Viitala.
"I said to certain players after the game that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people game time.
If they don't want to take that seat and take advantage of the opportunity, then it's not my fault.
But Kuqi also reminded us that players can't be expected to have immediate success when the playmates keep changing.
We haven't had the same lineup twice in a row this season.
Especially on the defensive side, the crowd has changed.
That's the biggest reason we're in this position," Kuqi stated.
Honka is a series jumbo after the VPS loss, tied for second last with TPS.
There are still seven rounds of betting left, so the Espoons still have time to avoid relegation to No 1.
I've never dropped a team in my life, and I'm not going to drop one now.
“We’re definitely not going to lose this series,” he said.
Lars von Trier to make TV series after decades away
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return as a TV show maker.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.

Trier will reportedly delve into scriptwriting for the series starting this fall.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also announced by Trier’s long-time collaborator, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, a producer known for his tough sales pitches.
He said a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Hold your breath," Aalbæk Jensen says in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his uproarious media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
For television, he directed the "Kingdom" series in the 1990s.

Ice Bucket challenge participant has jaw dislocated
Briton Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly when ice-cold water was poured over her that her damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
A woman has been taken for treatment after she roared while performing an Ice Bucket challenge so loud that her jaw bone was dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly when ice-cold water poured over her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold I just roared, but as I roared I felt my jaw start to stiffen," he tells The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before accident
I tried to close my mouth but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realised something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old Briton, who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to hospital where the jaw was placed back in place.
The clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Viewpoint to wolf howls (kin): How can you explain the increase in fan numbers?
I had a great feeling today.
So said basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, after Finland had played in the European Championship final against France at the Maroussi ballpark in Athens.
He wasn't exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So, too, were the 100 or so Finns who shouted into an otherwise empty hall that drew 20,000 spectators.
What would he have said 19 years later after the World Cup?
In Bilbao, the number of Finnish fans is 80 times higher.
The European Championships in 1995 was a time of searching for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final by winning, among other things, in a Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann put Möttölä on the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was wise from afar, even if it didn't all go according to script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
The total number of Finns at the Athens Games was reportedly just over 100.
That crowd included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbao, too, has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can tell you the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number is, it is an unimaginable number.
Here's something for sports sociologists to explain.
In the global economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can take a look at how our girls and boys are succeeding in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, Professor of Sports Sociology.
Certainly, both in Spain and at the Volleyball World Cup in Poland, there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
A shared experience.
Still, that doesn't explain everything.
You have to have an attraction in the sport itself.
Itkonen highlights sport as a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to a sporting Games than to Berlin to see art.
But without success, you can't get the masses moving.
Let's go back to 1995.
That's when head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball association and even the players to throw themselves into top-level sports professionally.
Almost ten years went by.
Then the direction changed and the national team action was put on a pedestal.
The Volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
They both enjoy the fruits of their labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productize their top sports, where the holy trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnivalist advocacy is, Itkonen reminds.
Will the ball sports be able to shift this massive interest to home kits as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played to an average of hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen considers the question to be a good one, and does not necessarily give an answer that promises very good for the species.
The other school thinks interest will shift.
The other one is the one who doesn't want a sweet belly full.
This group is ready for an adventure trip to the World Cup, but their basic thinking is that domestic leagues are of little interest.
It’s a challenge for people in the midst of the heat.
Confirmation for Bottas property - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards Formula One driver Valtteri Bottas with a beachside home plot.
The local government unanimously approved the handover of the 1.4-hectare site at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, there will be a free house.
The success of Bottas has been observed in Nastola since his karting days.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has been acquired by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
The area has seven buildings in demolition condition, of which the municipality will demolish six at cost by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth podium in Formula 1 in Belgium this year.
He is fifth in the World Cup standings.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Villähde during his childhood.
He currently lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever he is free of form.
Bottas has visited secondary schools as well as youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming - but hardly for the poor
It is currently presenting and testing them at the ongoing U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
The testers of Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are the ball-persons on the field, but Marcus Giron, one of the top amateurs among college players, also wears one.
He says the shirt will help him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven into the nylon shirt, and the information is transmitted to the patch on the shirt and then to the smartphone or tablet computer.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The loo, which acts as a central unit, is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house hasn't given an exact time for the shirt's sale to begin and also hasn't even hinted at its price, Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren isn't the only company investing in smart clothing.
California-based Athos has launched a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars apiece and the thumb-sized central processing unit they require costs two hundred dollars.
Tech clothes were also written by Red Orbit.
A smart way to save on textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, soon entering his sophomore year, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which later-year students borrow their books for a nominal fee rather than selling them on straight away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 to use it for the entire semester, plus a hefty sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in the US state of Georgia.
Schroeder says his books from last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university's board of trustees, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many avenues at their disposal to reduce those costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches like Schroeder's idea.
More students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying markedly less for it than students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the industry reveal that about a quarter of books in university bookstores this past spring were rental books, according to Trevor Meyer, president of the Neebo firm.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are sourced from on-campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Webshops
In online shopping, you can get a new book for only a third of what it would cost at a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but you can get the book for $239.99 from the specialty books Web store Chegg.com.
Buy second-hand
Used books are a good option if the reader is not distracted by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, you can get "Calculus" secondhand at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University senior Matt Casaday, 25 years, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" used on Amazon.com for just $0.42.
A new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
At times, the reforms in the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, you can only find an old edition for a fraction of the price you should pay for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and don't need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 percent on the price of a new book.
Renting a "Calculus" book for an entire semester, for example, costs about $20.
Check out the hiring company's rules, such as on notes, using a highlighter and the fees that follow from wear and tear.
Renter, beware: if you forget to return a book, the late fee may be greater than the book purchase price.
E-books
Getting e-books instead of regular paper ones may also be an issue.
Sometimes these books are rented, paying for access to the e-book to its holder, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc bookstores.
You can get "Calculus" as an e-book from the Chegg store for six months for about $61.
Bracey said many literature students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in science and engineering can be very expensive.
It pays to compare different sellers, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends taking advantage of the book's ISBN number to figure out the price, because you can use it to make sure you're looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price from the university bookstore.
Tampere-based Legion Theatre celebrates 20 years
Founded in 1994, theatre opposes unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
Anyone who wants to make performing art is welcome.
Organises expression-oriented leisure activities for the long-term unemployed aged 17-35.
The proposals often take a stand on society.
In recent years, there have been shows such as Depression Moderata, Mememe! - humorous stories of narcissism and classic adaptations.

Nearly double the number of people killed in the fires compared to last year
Fires have killed nearly double the number of people this year compared with last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish National Rescue Association (Spek), so far 55 people have been killed in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 over 65s.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in fires by the end of August.
The vast majority of fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced and other small houses.
Spek is a reminder to refresh your home fire safety.
At the very least, all home smoke alarms should be ensured, according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to use.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all premises in the home.
Children should also be told what electrical devices they are allowed to use when they are home alone.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the Nato summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed events at the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived from as far away as Belgium.
Youths rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were hoisted to safety after a night stuck in the Blue Mountains in Australia's New South Wales region.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after midday on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Relatives became concerned about the youngsters, who had not returned home, and called police at 8pm.
A search party made up of local police and helpers was sent to search for the youths, and the two were found about 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Officers spent the night with the pair, and they were lifted to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
The Ukrainian military said the soldiers were given orders to retreat.
Ukraine says paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks in the field.
According to a military spokesman, the opposing side's gunfire has been so accurate that the gunman is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
In the Azov Sea off southeastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian patrol ship that suffered artillery hits yesterday sank this morning, according to the Border Guard.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Patrol said it had no certainty where the ship was fired from.
The separatists said on social media that they had fired at the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not invade Ukraine.
But Lavrov insisted that Ukrainian forces must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
The Foreign Minister said the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also reminded that Russia will respond to any new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners," Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains cause Malmo and Copenhagen to flood
Streets were flooded in Malmo and Copenhagen on Sunday as heavy rains lashed southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, shuffling traffic and burying cars underneath.
Officials estimated Sunday that it might take time for the flood to ease, although rains were forecast to stop for Monday.
The heavy rains caught Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warning was issued in advance for the rains.
Meteorologist Ari Mustala, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French Socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's main backer says
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" toward the trouble-hit socialist president, whose new government lineup failed to win the approval of a majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stick by him," Valls said, earning a round of applause.
In a blunt gesture, the prime minister called on the government to leave alone France's controversial 35-hour work week despite a controversial suggestion from new economy minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work in concert with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused discord by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs who expressed differing opinions and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future."
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, derided the Socialists' continuing discord among themselves and said she did not believe Valls' new government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war by phone, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even through the summer.
"And the new government will not last until the autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve parliament and considered certain his party's electoral victory in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
France's ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in March's municipal elections and the far right held the top spot in May's EU elections.
According to a poll in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party may split into several rival groups before Hollande's term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Po University, warned that the French will soon lose patience unless the new Socialist government succeeds in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to notice quickly that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, it could get even worse.
Good Morning Finland hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda were badly disappointed in the recorded part of the programme.
The Good Morning Finland program posted a funny video of the recordings on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, presenters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record a Good Morning Finland ad-puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording doesn't quite go down the tubes.
Alm-Siira goes crazy with his words as he tries to pronounce the word budget session, and his shuffling also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their cheeks time and time again.
And these heroes should still be allowed to pull the live broadcast tomorrow, Good Morning Finland’s Facebook update states.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked in the photo agency of a magazine picture, finished third in a series of portraits in 1972.
Pictured is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held at the Builders’ House in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security was huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to film.
I took this picture from four to five feet away.
The light and background were spot on.
I immediately realized that this time I had succeeded.
You can see from the look on Meir's face that Middle Eastern leaders have had a tough time before.
At that time, the competition was dominated by pictures of well-known people or events.
It's great that you can succeed with other images these days, too, as long as you have the idea and the visual torque.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's crash shot of the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the operations of the Helsinki police narcotics unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 person-years of work.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki in his doctoral dissertation at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables the multi-use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected in order to solve a crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive legality monitoring.
The claim will be reviewed on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "The fish and chicken dishes included in the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of the Women’s Journey school in Pirkkala caused a food stir on social media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the menu will we prepare a vegetarian option!
That's what's stated on the school wall in a forgotten, 15-year-old bulletin.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to Pirkkala municipality.
Food and cleanliness service manager Arja Vaarma tells Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there was sometimes this idea that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Each student will receive a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, students in Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a doctor’s or nurse’s certificate of vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle on the grounds that young people’s experiments with vegetarian food may leave nutrition lacking and the absence of meat or chicken may cause puzzlement from the parents of the pupils.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3bn Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise company, is in talks to buy rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The information comes from people closely involved in the matter.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, which has a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources said that information about a possible deal may be released as early as this week, although it is also possible that the talks will not bear fruit.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names released because the talks are not taking place in public.
Representatives for Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and an Apollo representative declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue grew 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when revenue was $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its revenue in 2013 was $1.2 billion, up six percent from the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India's middle classes.
The companies are racing to become the number one choice for these new customers as they choose to cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since a 2007 deal valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current lineup in 2000 following its merger with the Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino arm of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the released data, Genting's stake in the company was 28 per cent, Apollo's 20 per cent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP's 8 per cent from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise account for 82 percent of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document released by Prestige Cruise when the shares were issued.
The City Council of Tampere is discussing the matter today.
Animalia hopes for strong support for the initiative from the city government.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing her doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the dolphinarium should end quickly in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years, the view has become widespread around the world that the holding of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal-friendly nor ethically sustainable.
I would like to see that view in Texas as well.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination,” Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin reinforces the demands for downgrading dolphin activity.
The death of Näs is a sad continuation of the dark history of Särkänniemi’s dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how the dolphins of Tampere could be moved to a restricted sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience the return to the dolphins’ original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience even more life than a non-stimulating concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The aim of the Finnish Association for Animal Welfare Animalia is to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of dolphins on 1 September.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open talks on new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that Ukraine's government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin talks on the "statehood" of the seceding region, Russian news sources say.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine needed to be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his apparent strategy since the violence began five years ago: to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to effectively grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya independence, allowing it to gravitate towards Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state Channel 1 TV, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military's efforts to retake the separatist-held eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, which separatists seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the region "Novorossiya," "New Russia" – a term reminiscent of the glory days before the revolutions of the Russian superpower.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks will be an "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and government forces attack civilians in separatist-held areas.
"We need to immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on the technical aspects, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of southeastern Ukraine. This will take into account the interests of the people who live there," he says.
Peskov said Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership as it tries to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict of Ukraine."
The heckling from the Kremlin representative, aimed at correcting a "false interpretation" of Putin's comments, underscored that the Russian regime is handling the separatist insurgency in the eastern regions differently than it did in Crimea, when it effectively captured territory, of which the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because, according to pre-conflict polls, most of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
Independence, which has been discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give Ukraine's local governments the right to agree on their own trade deals and foreign relations, effectively giving the Kremlin control of the region that links Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed by Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet as well as commercial shipping port areas and historic coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the area between Rostov and Crimea, which produce products vital to the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers – after new elections – consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions that differ from Ukraine's core region on their own economy and status of languages.
But his vision for independence seems starkly different from that of separatists, perhaps armed and stoked by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin's made his latest call to the Kiev government for talks with the pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week following the incursion of Russian tanks and troops into eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky is the start of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
It has led to a massive reinforcement of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, a city of half a million people, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsky and the narrow expanse of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke Saturday in Brussels to European Union leaders, pleading for more to be done to prevent future violations by Russia in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit made no decisions on direct action; the leaders suggested drawing up additional sanctions so they can be put in place if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored detachments and 1,000 troops moved into the Donetsk region last week to reinforce ailing separatists, Gen. Andriy Lysenko, the representative of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters Saturday in Kiev.
Lysenko said the first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian parachutists captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opener was scored by Japanese batter Keisuke Honda as early as the seventh minute of play.
The second half saw Sulley Muntari hit first and, a little later, Jeremy Menez from the penalty spot.
Lazio, too, got roughed up in the closing moments of the game after their narrowing goal, but Antonio Candreva's shot was deflected in by goalkeeper Diego Lopez.
Lopez joined Milan this season from Real Madrid.
On the coaching debut of Milan's former striker icon Inzaghi, the San Siro stadium was only half-full.
A crowd of 39,000 was announced for the match.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in swirl of nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has declared himself bullish after hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancee and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a series of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were posted on the internet in the wake of a widespread celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to hold a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence as well as other superstars including top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Grecko also appear to have been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list includes the names of 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "this is sickening."
All personal contact and pictures should remain private.
It is shameful that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Grecko, who is in New York, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online magazine as "disgraceful" and said the victims "feel disgraced."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, among them also two shots of Palmer topless at the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film credits include "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A rep for Lawrence told TMZ that "this is a brazen invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen was angered by the hacker in a tweet: 'Publishing photos stolen from a cell phone is in no way different from selling a stolen product'.
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a purely legal point of view.
Finland played almost as if they were on home soil and emerged with a sensational victory over Cuba in the Volleyball World Cup.
See pictures of the fan buzz.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not the red-white of a Pole but the blue-white of a Finn.
Finland's victory was watched by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek arena, according to STT.
It felt like playing on home soil.
Such a big impact the fans had on our game," Finland captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was already 0-2 down in the match, but went on to win 3-2.
In the fourth set, Finland made a miracle climb from six points behind.
Cuba led the round 16-10, but after that the Finns had a go.
A couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed, however, when a charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late to the game.
Finnish ballpark fans have been conquering Europe at a high pace in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, there are more than 8,000 Finnish fans.
As if every Finland basket was the winning basket of the match, USA star player Stephen Curry praised the Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
