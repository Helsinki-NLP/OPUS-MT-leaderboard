Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed as mentally ill and now makes art on the subject - "A person should have the right to their own body"
Dozens of patient stories hang from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts' Project room gallery.
Each of them says Camille Auer's name.
The papers tell a perennial story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell the person my point-by-point treatment history in order to make the violent nature of the process visible," Auer tells me.
By process, she refers to the gender reassignment process.
It's often a years-long study period that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins with a referral to the "gender identity disorder" diagnostic studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had been using the estrogen he had ordered over the Internet and was very far along in his own repair process anyway.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to be legally correct.
Translaki, i.e. the Act on the Confirmation of Transsecual Sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilisation in order to obtain the correct gender, for example, in the Population Register Centre and passport.
Currently, every person correcting their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of inability to reproduce.
People have the right to decide about their own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Finnish Translation Act has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obliges parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared the amendment to the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There was an election and the True Finns entered the government.
Now the law change is stalled again.
We are talking about domestic political disputes that are not even related to this particular law.
"The government doesn't want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, executive director of Amnesty's Finland division.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the medicines used by Auer.
In the patient record installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by a psychologist from Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote an account that would define Auer's right to treatment and help.
The student’s sense of reality appears vulnerable to vacillation.
The researcher’s perception of the self appears fragmented in a borderline way, and unstable personality traits are emphasised.
Auer did not identify himself from those descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as mentally ill," Auer says.
It was an even bigger shock when Auer was not granted gender reassignment treatment.
Medical staff said his resources were not sufficient to begin the process.
He was denied his own identity.
It was then, on February 11, 2015, that Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the television in the transpol waiting lounge apart.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded emerged from that television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and how to use it.
"It's crazy that any person defined as female at birth can have their breasts enlarged, but to have their breasts removed, you need a diagnosis," Auer tells me.
Your body is not your own if you feel you are anything other than your sex at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
The gender reassignment process is tougher for many for mental reasons than purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people for whom you have to justify your own existence and right to your own gender experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied care, citing that their resources aren't enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have mental symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
On these grounds, the medical staff may decide that treatment cannot be started.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and it's a thing people tend to find difficult to digest".
Depression has been treated with medication and once Auer started taking hormones, I felt better.
He had finally been able to put into words the feelings that had existed in childhood and teenage years.
Why the broad jaw didn’t seem to fit your body and why your chest muscles had to be round instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people close to him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing up, using your voice and moving," she tells me.
Today, Auer already feels seen, she exists as a woman.
But early in the process, haphazard comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when loved ones misgender.
"They should know and they know who I am but they won't or won't be able to internalise it," he continues.
But not all trans people need physical changes.
They don't suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, one cannot get official confirmation of one’s own gender.
"There is absolutely no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In June 2014, the Danish Parliament approved a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination regarding legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code stating that they feel they are of the other sex.
After the six-month reflection period, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry provides the applicant with a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also demanded in Finland, and this demand is also summed up in Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist; the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and can bring about political change, at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Civil Rights of African Americans (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri. The reason is the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP's travel release for Missouri will take effect on August 28, 2017, and calls on African American travelers, visitors and locals to pay close attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state where numerous questionable race-based events have occurred recently," the organization's statement said.
A law that recently took effect in Missouri makes it harder to bring discrimination cases to court. In addition, the enforcement of state laws disproportionately targets minorities. The NAACP said these factors led to the issuing of the travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are stopped based on the color of their skin and assaulted or killed," Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have not previously heard of as many cases in as short a time."
The Missouri travel bulletin is the organization's first warning for the U.S. state.
The organization cited racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri as examples, as well as the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black student from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. He was arrested by Missouri police, though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel briefing also pointed to a Missouri attorney general's report that found police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be on the lookout and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what may happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare by, for example, including money for bail or telling relatives they plan to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, the sixteenth most of any state in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACLU, an organization that defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws obliging police to arrest people for immigration violations. The organization says this increases racial profiling.
Generally, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and apply to other states. However, recently, NGOs have issued them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for a report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä (centre), who is responsible for state ownership steering, has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension payment received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle reports.
That, the minister says, is at odds with the state's expression of will.
The additional pension of 130,000 euros received by Vauramo was highlighted this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair announced that it will retire from supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
The company said the decision is in line with last year's resolution on corporate governance.
Sanctions immediately made talk tougher
Not so long ago, it seemed that U.S.-Russian relations were on their way from cold to warm.
On the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along just fine.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
There was a bitter reaction to the new economic sanctions passed by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
The most stunning response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says the sanctions bill signed by Trump amounts to a "full-blown trade war."
Even if the Russian reactions are dismissed only as escalations and excesses of political rhetoric, the escalation of tension between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after the brief post-Trump honeymoon.
In the United States, passing a sanctions bill on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
True, Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, but for the president, it was reportedly considerably trickier to pass the law.
In fact, Trump recently criticized the law he signed as "significantly flawed."
President Trump's snarl must have been caused by Russia in particular, although the passing of a law restricting his own powers must also have been abhorrent.
As is well known, an investigation is underway in the United States into possible Russian interference in the presidential election as well as into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.
The strained relationship between the United States and Russia is a fact of life after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed frequently and various scandalous twists have been revealed to have been almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not made in the United States under the leadership of the president but in spite of the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is a gimmick in the United States, the same goes for the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the EU's core Baltic Sea region is straining relations.
The EU has given prominence to the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and has called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained united, at least on the surface, in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member state like Finland that does a lot of business with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The implications of the recent US sanctions bill are still unclear.
There are fears that the sanctions will make it more difficult for many European companies.
In Finland, the impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought-out and scrupulous.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
The Trump White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights
Interfering with statues is the surest sign of a change in power.
The Americans know that as well as anyone: Iraqis, along with American soldiers, toppled a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's chief ideologues, knew well what he was doing in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a word-of-mouth over the president's proposal to greatly reduce legal immigration.
Miller wasn't exactly criticizing the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organisers and figures impersonating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue and, in particular, the addition of a poem by Emma Lazarus to the pedestal of the statue in 1903 – 17 years after the statue was completed.
Here's how Miller chimed in on Acosta: "I don't want to go into more detail about history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller wasn't wrong, per se, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
Essential are the poignant words of Lazarus, the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not just immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The exhausted refuse of your teeming shore."
The poem is more relevant now than ever.
By no means did Miller engage in literary criticism. He made clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The dispute over the meaning of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural dispute over the meaning of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be affixed to the statue's pedestal. They knew full well that the act was strongly political.
The statue was intended to embody the links between French and American republicanism with a classical emblem, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the deported.
Attaching the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationhood.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a mouthpiece who can now be seen as some kind of omen for Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not extend an invitation to anyone, but is an early frontrunner for neoconservatives to carry the torch of the United States into a world shrouded in darkness: “Lady Liberty steps up.
He is taking the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch will not show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on perspective.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people seeking shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty is comforted by giving hope and welcoming.
And that is absolutely not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torch will not show the way but fan the flames of hatred, their only source of strength.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Great Britain national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made the Great Britain national team
UK Athletics chief performance officer Neil Black says the 16 Scots members of the national team taking part in the world championships are a "significant endorsement."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday.
Black said something special was "going to happen" in Scotland that Great Britain Athletics needed to learn from.
"This is welcome, and we'll continue to study it long enough to understand what's at stake," Black says.
"I had a conversation with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they thought it was something to do with the running of the institute.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes it is linked to the union's activities,
and the Athletics Association of Great Britain believes it is motivated by their actions.
And the average streetwalker reckons he must have something to do with it.
It’s a great thing, whatever it is.”
Many Scottish athletes compete for medals in London, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was unbelievably magnificent," says Black.
"Athletes exited the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated no matter where they happen to live and train.
There was genuine emotion and passion for sport in Eilidh's words."
Eilidh Doyle is a Commonwealth Championships silver medallist in the 400m hurdles, and this is her fifth world championships. She thinks it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven for 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He will compete in London in the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare will run the 1,500m in London. Also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an outstanding season behind him, including wins in the UK World Cup qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scot on the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The national team captain says he is "hugely proud" to have so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for finals places and medals.
"Being captain is a great honour anyway, but it's even more special because the national team members voted for the captain," says Doyle.
"Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They are among the distinguished athletes vying for awards.
My captain's speech?
I thought it went just fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It's important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere will be insanely great.'
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't handle criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
Americans loved George Washington, but newspapers soon began to criticize him for everything from possible domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism certainly irritated,
He did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led dumb and silent as sheep to the slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their presenters.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff considers the challenge unjustified, and the attitude was dismissive online as well.
"Who cares? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is the stunningly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second-best ratings among the 50 governors for his actions.
Hogan is not a responsive hothead.
He has run the state solidly and held firm to the principles.
He has also been able to use Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents, posting a photo of his bald head undergoing chemotherapy there.
That's why blocking users who come to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, excused the governor's actions in an interview with The Washington Post. She said it was simply a matter of moderating comments.
However, branding commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users who were blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to leaders of their choice. They were not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me their comments were respectful, thoughtful and matter-of-fact.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in comments to the Washington Post news release.
"Nor can I accept that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately viewed as an organised bunch in some way and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "focused attack." Someone else might call them to advance issues considered important.
In the age of Facebook, it's easy to control communication by blocking a reviewer or deleting a critical comment.
In the old days, you would have had to send staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrest and silence protesters.
It’s the same thing, only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public officeholder to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
He has been sued by Twitter users blocked by President Trump.
The issue was the subject of the first major ruling last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court Judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the American Civil Rights Union took a swipe at Kentucky's Republican governor, Matt Bevin, for using Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's day, low-cost postage had a similar effect to the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
At that time there were trolls.
Nicknames Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers decrying Washington's decisions.
The president's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, a cooperation, trade and shipping agreement between the U.S. and Britain. This is evident from documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
But he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the foundation stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
We should stop feeding birds in the summer immediately.
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, plus online postings of a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Varsinais-Suomi, but then also individual ones from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Greenfinches have died from a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, especially pigeons.
In the 2000s, however, the disease also began to be detected in finches.
In 2009, it was very good.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the Finnish green finch population, after which the species’ stocks have been on the road to recovery.
There have now been sick greenfinches, but at least not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, Master of Museums at the University of Helsinki’s Central Museum of Natural Sciences (Luomus).
It is feared that the previous outbreak of greenfinches will reoccur again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop summer feeding the birds immediately.
More on this later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home-court advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping to benefit from home field advantage for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian stages the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Northern Irishman Rafferty led a tournament at neighbouring Archerfield Links ground last year ahead of the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of the new venue and will be an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of club founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvad.
"I watched the Renaissance Club being built, and with this event it gets to its full glory," Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best. It's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is a keen ambassador for the game, and he is proud of what he has achieved here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field."
Englishman Eales is defending the title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special occasion," the Southport-based player says.
"I didn't get to defend my Extremadura Open win because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back to me: winning the tournament was a wonderful thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil. He went on tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This will be his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more relevant than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and I've played pretty strong.
I'm happy with my game so far.'
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free. Car parking costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Säkylä investigates possible indoor air problems in barracks
In Säkylä, no indoor air problems have been found in the barracks building of the Pori Brigade Signal Company, at least so far, the brigade said on Thursday.
Indoor air surveys are still continuing.
The investigations began when a man who had suspended his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been detected in the health situation of the other conscripts.
It turned out it was an isolated case and no other people who served in that unit have had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems, Holma says.
The brigade statement says that due to the July arrival batch, goods have had to be moved to barracks, which may have caused the dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stale as a result, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold country
Bardina Degei does not use a stove in cooking.
He also rarely uses pots.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia's restive Papua province. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato – locally known as "nota" – right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred sweet potato is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture. She sits on a muddy ground floor, where she usually also does her daily chores, such as doing laundry in murky water retrieved from a nearby swamp.
The toilet post is supplied by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and no fields have been assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the soldiers.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 in the evening," Degei tells me.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum that forced 1,026 village elders to vote in public before the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its ire on the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the area and bars foreign journalists and human rights monitors from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and bleak. The journey there begins with an hour-and-a-half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-wrenching five-hour drive in a hire car.
There is no public transport here.
The town of about 19,000 has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with corrugated tin roofs stained yellow-brown by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the advent of Christian missionaries, Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have any clothes like this," Degei tells me. She means her colorful, hand-woven wrap-around headpiece, dark skirt and brightly colored blouse.
"Before, all we had were leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province. Twenty-eight percent of its people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
Paniai is a highland region roughly the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents. Just about 100 kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has estimated timber reserves of $78 billion.
For Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the stifling presence of Indonesia's strong military.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local Army units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and are mercilessly silenced.
Human rights activists say the Indonesian military has killed more than 500,000 Papuans since 1969 and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970s took on genocidal proportions.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area during peaceful protests.
The Brisbane Archdiocese’s 2016 report, We Will Lose Everything, contains accounts of previous year’s atrocities, including extrajudicial executions, torture – rape and electrocution are particularly popular methods – and relentless attacks on peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are weekly cases," said Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Eighty-three percent of the province's 3.5 million people are Christian, but the demographics are changing as Muslims from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region for a better livelihood.
Javanese warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable mix in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at the market cheaper than the locals," says Abeth You, 24, a native of Paniai who moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their customers".
In his 2014 election campaign, Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – pledged to address injustices and human rights abuses in Papua.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Paniai experienced something of a trough just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by the fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers they should use their headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to accounts from victims and witnesses, drunken soldiers grabbed the children and assaulted them with rifle butts, beating them.
That's how one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the State Election Commission building near the scene was set on fire, and the next day, things started happening.
About 1,000 Papuans – young men and women and children – gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
Carrying hunting bows for the festivities, they began performing a traditional waita dance of Papua's Mee Pago tribe, where you dance in a ring and imitate birdsong.
Some of the protesters began stoning police and army buildings.
As the mood heated up, soldiers were told by an internal radio system: "If crowds of people resist more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been made public to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident leader of Kego Koto area, sensed that the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of soldiers.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin witnessed the shootings.
"I ran up to him and made sure it was indeed him," Yohanes told TIME magazine, sorrowfully. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw she was dead ... I kissed her."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that officers were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many injured.
Reports of the killings reached Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing condolences to the families of the victims and pledging that the violence in Papua would be addressed.
"I want the incident investigated immediately so that nothing like it ever happens again."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights abuses outside the justice system.
But he immediately began to retract what he was saying.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we are determined to investigate the breaches, but there are certain processes that are needed to do that," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he did not intend to start surveys in Papua.
"Everything will be sorted out in court," he told me.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity." The crimes are linked to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999. Wiranto said to TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua have already been cleared, including the events in Paniai.
Families of Paniai's victims view the claims with grim disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes tells me.
"I'm already tired of this."
She says she still lives in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"Yes, I am afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me. I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He says he had been assaulted by soldiers after helping to bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers sought me out after burying the victims," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in the neighboring district of Paniai in Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in the conflict between villagers and the construction company's manager, which was sparked when the manager refused to take the man, who had lost consciousness, to hospital. Children were among the injured.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had become stranded while fishing on a nearby river. He died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said villagers stoned officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals said a mobile police unit from Indonesia's paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We are terrified. We are afraid of retribution," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for the officers who fired the shots to be held accountable and for the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development is fuelling discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in Papua's verdant central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans through sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The military has responded to the insurgency by arbitrarily detaining and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of "safeguarding national sovereignty."
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and even that is too expensive for the locals,
Just like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is women's work, and one woman may be responsible for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the crop is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes costs just 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, disparities in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have widened, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
Jobs are scarce, and tend to go to better educated and wealthier migrants than locals.
Only a few people in Papua have the capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there is no work and no money here," says John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Outlying Papua is dwarfed in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua despite having been granted a rare filming licence. The official reason was an inability to co-operate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor promoted development by lifting restrictions on news coverage.
"Reporters covering Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The absence of press freedom means the Indonesian government is only under pressure from Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numerous and widespread violations," including the Paniai shooting scene.
These nations have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up the evidence of human rights violations would be tricky."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights envoy Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, locals broke their silence and expressed their desire for freedom, according to an anonymous source who attended the meeting.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but Papuans report they are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi means well, but he is surrounded by people who are embroiled in the Paniai shooting scene," says Gobai, the tribal council's president.
He wants Jokowi to know the situation of the Panians: under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army, they live in deprivation and poverty, virtually devoid of health care services and educational opportunities.
Gobai said the Panians, like other Papuans, view the votes they cast for Jokowi as "a debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money. They just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting scene once more showed resistance metaphorically: They buried one of the victims on the land opposite the police station and army post.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says, his head drooping.
"What else could we do?"
Dereck Chisora berates Robert Helenius for cancelling rematch: 'Even his own fans don't want to see'
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight on May 27 in the Hartwall arena.
But the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora girds for the reason of flopping the rematch completely on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don’t live in New York, I don’t want to sell tickets.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks," Chisora blunts.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial points verdict.
Ticket sales for the rematch were sluggish, with Nisse Sauerland, its promoter, telling the Evening News in May that the match had been postponed until the autumn.
There has been no news of the match since.
But the cancellation no longer upsets Chisora.
After all, the match would probably have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora fell ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital told me I had to have surgery, Chisora tells me.
The Briton says he is currently about 45 per cent fit.
By all accounts, he is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, with Dillian Whyte in his sights.
Chisora suffered a disjointed defeat to Whyte in December.
Fire engulfs Torch skyscraper in Dubai for second time
Flames engulfed one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337-metre-high 79-storey building.
This was the second fire in two years in the building, which happens to be called Torch, the Torch.
The building was emptied and no one is known to have been injured. There was no idea of the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about a dozen minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai rescue officials said firefighting crews were able to extinguish the blaze at 4 a.m. local time and remained to cool the building.
The government said it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case could reignite questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
After the 2015 fire, the Torch building's board commissioned an investigation, which found that it was the boards used for facade cladding and insulation that suffered the most damage.
In the UK, police believe insulation and cladding boards at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid progress of the flames in a blaze that killed 80 people in June.

In the US, more than 20 per cent of airline passengers take banned items on board, a survey reveals
A survey of air travelers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the U.S. had knowingly or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto planes past U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other items with blades that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1 percent said they learned only afterward that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey, which was answered by more than 1,000 passengers, was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter airline. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to flout the rules than others.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA rules, 19.7 percent were Gen Y and less than 15 percent belonged to Gen X.
The most common way to break the rules was to take food and liquids on a plane.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking items with the blade on to a plane. A further 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they knowingly took banned drugs on to a plane.
The survey included passengers from across the United States. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many people had taken contraband items past security by mistake and how many had done so knowingly.
Unsurprisingly, those who travel the most are also the most likely to take contraband past security – knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, the TSA guidelines are quite complicated and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what liquids to take on a plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For a while there was also a belief that books should not be taken on a plane.
Liquids may be taken on domestic flights but not on international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his decision to delay decisions made during Obama's term to reduce emissions
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce smog-causing emissions.
Pruitt said the change shows that the agency he leads is taking better account of the needs of state environmental policymakers than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the lawsuit filed against his earlier decision in federal appeals court.
States should start complying with the 2015 ground ozone standard from 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would push back implementation of the decisions by a year so his agency has more time to familiarize itself with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or impede economic growth."
Pruitt was Oklahoma's U.S. attorney general before President Donald Trump nominated him to head the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest setback for Pruitt's plan to relax regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief overstepped his authority in trying to delay the implementation of an Obama administration decision that affected oil and gas companies. The ruling obliged the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his about-face on ozone regulations will only strengthen the EPA's cooperation with states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements as scheduled.
"During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected to be sued by activist groups and others, where an agreement on timelines could be reached," Pruitt said. In his previous action, he sued the environmental agency more than a dozen times.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it gives us."
But the EPA statement noted that Pruitt can still use his "authority to delay the execution of decisions as well as his other legal powers" to ensure the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information."
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, passed last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 rulings by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general who led the consortium of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group plans to keep up the pressure.
"The EPA's change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia were involved in the suit.
Ground-level ozone occurs when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, for example, react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing problems for sensitized groups of people. It also contributes to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's concerning how much pressure was required for the guy in charge of our breathing air to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration, whose ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-interested groups."
Supercar maker's upcoming SUV 'happens in Ferrari style'
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while seeking to hold on to its exclusive status.
That is likely to happen, but it will be in Ferrari style," chief executive Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be unveiled next year when the Italian supercar maker presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All measles cases in Eastern Finland of the same virus type
Rantasalmi measles infection is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo, THL informs.
The National Institute for Health and Welfare’s virology laboratory has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth measles infection in Eastern Savo is of the same strain as the previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July in a Salmian person is of the same virus type as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections in Eastern Savo are related to the first measles outbreak in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not seen any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may emerge after the fifth sufferer until mid-August, and thus the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor in charge of infectious diseases in Soster’s primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspicions of them have emerged since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their vaccination protection is up to date, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for authorised squealing
Pontica's soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
The underlying argument is that the process produces methanol, which is toxic, along with liquor.
Making squid at home will be legal next year, but legalising moonshine soup is not even being considered.
Squid is made by fermentation, moonshine by distilling again.
Underlying the regulation of distillation is the argument that the process, along with liquor, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to legislate moonshine as an everyman’s right, says Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, moonshine distillation was not considered for legalisation.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no debate about the release of distilling, says Rep. Outi Mäkelä (D-Calif.).
He is on the negotiating team of the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
In the future, permission to distill moonshine at home cannot even be granted by application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to a permit.
Tuominen says that there will be a simple rule for making alcoholic beverages at home: alcohol can be made at home by fermentation.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally do squealing at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and enables the production of squeals, Mäkelä explains.
The production must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavour and aromas produced during their fermentation can be clearly detected in the drink.
Under the new law, you can make as many drinks as you like, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
Kilju’s actions are no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol consumed in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Justice Department.
The Alcohol Act will come before Parliament as soon as the autumn term begins.
The session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the government has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius rushed to hospital escorted by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, suffering from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital with suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already been discharged from hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British Mirror newspaper, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pains but was discharged from hospital this afternoon.
A prisons spokeswoman confirmed Pistorius was taken to hospital for examinations.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family, meanwhile, said the former top-ranked athlete was fine.
Last summer the Supreme Court sentenced the six-time Paralympic gold medallist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Steenkamp was shot by Pistorius in February 2013.
Littered phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The transcripts of phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone call on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop speaking publicly about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The US president blasted Nieto for publicly knocking out the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall along the US southern border at Mexico's expense.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. There was a tense exchange of words during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that a deal for the U.S. to take refugees bound for Australia was "ridiculous," "miserable" and "stupid." Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on refugee settlements in the U.S.
Mr Trump ended the call by stating to Mr Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia massacre: Activists reframe racist lynching for justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car passes the crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men block the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The troop leader, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath from his cigar and teeters through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n---u!" the man snaps.
"Get out of the car!"
Shouts break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-enactment that aired on 22 July 2017.
But the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is threaded around "Roger's" neck.
Since 2005, human rights groups have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reframe the events of 1946. At the time, the Ku Klux Klan lynched two Black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with the murders.
"It's mind-boggling that no one has been arrested over these years – even though the murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps set up the re-enactment.
"It is a stain of history, but above all it is a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the re-enactment is a startling call to action. It also reminds the people of Monroe that wrong has never been righted.
"We want those responsible to be put on trial. We want things to finally come to an end, and we want to recover from the grief and make up, but most of all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make up until we get justice."
Coroner covers the body of a victim killed in the Georgia massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.
But no one was charged with murder.
Although the culprits have been at large for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have been known to locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, Black people in the state of Georgia were allowed by the Supreme Court to vote in presidential elections for the first time. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and elections were held in the summer.
The FBI said there was an incident around the election in which a Black tenant farmer, Roger Malcom, stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, in a fight apparently involving Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
Brooks said there were rumors in town that Hester had been having an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her child.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, powerful white landowner Loy Harrison posted Malcom's $600 bail, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were joined by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before the Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders," the FBI debrief states.
"It is also apparent that there was collusion between state and local authorities. Authorities were involved in the murders and disposed of the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voting rights murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to signal to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has directed the re-enactment of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating. It is a depiction of shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States.
It's hard to watch the show but even harder not to watch, which Greene says is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides as well," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen blacks and two dozen whites – gathered to listen to Greene's routine summation of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has played the local Ku Klux Klan leader in the re-enactment for years, but the role is always equally difficult and repulsive.
"I get dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh tells me.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is also kept on display so that it never happens again."
Across the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, or Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The performance opens with a scene in which Malcom screams and shoves Hester. He is furious that Hester has been having an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear? I said get off my land, n---u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then there's the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit you too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene fumes.
"I just don't think white people at the time used the word n---u."
"Yeah," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You have to use a longer version."
The subject matter of the show is unpleasant, but the room is taken over by a spirit of friends.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for show, but to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words smite.
Nobody's laughing.
The recasting will end quickly and violently.
Screaming, gunshots, and silence.
A woman dressed in black funeral attire stands by the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few hundred feet away, some 50 spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience is black and half is white.
Among them are a couple who have come to see a show from Ithaca in New York State, but most are locals.
They have visited, with Brooks' guidance, the graves of the victims in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have gone from story to reality, the mood at the scene is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the audience.
The actors who played the lynchpins take off their capes and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a rough performance.
"No problem," the woman involved in the performance comforts.
'We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and actors gather for a joint dinner.
A white couple from Altanta has a lively conversation about the performance with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski has a hard time finding words when she describes the sensations evoked by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible acts said and done by people who look like you – precisely because they look like you," she says.
"It made me realize that lynchings still happen," he added. "They just call them arrests."
Across the room, Brooks recalls civil rights developments to listeners seated at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's show.
"Resetting is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we've been through, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message of it is that this could happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it."
Scrambling vegetables in shops stirs: This much removing 'extra parts' actually saves you
Is it allowed to remove the cauliflower leaves in the store before weighing?
How about taking out the big hat part of the pineapple - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers are highly divisive: for some, it is a sign of extreme scarcity; for others, they do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go in the bin at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable department of Ruoholahti K-Citymarket in Helsinki, because many people tear off the leafy parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, leaves are taken to the store's biowaste.
According to a news release published by Taloussanomat, snoozing at the vegetable counter amazes shopkeepers.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save you money?
How significant is nuking really?
We Women tested how the price changes when leaves or strains are taken out of pineapple, top artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower.
Cauliflower: The cauliflower, which costs 2.10 euros, was priced at 1.80 euros when you peel all the leaves off it.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing €2.30 dropped to €1.95 when its stock was wrung out.
Globe artichokes: The price of EUR 2.60 became EUR 2.40 when the short stock was cut off.
Mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Excluding stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and, without the stock, 80 cents.
The end result: If you pluck leaves and strains, you can save a few tens of cents on one vegetable at best.
When considered in percentages, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 percent.
This would have saved $1.20!
Neymar bought out by Barcelona after signing five-year deal with PSG
Brazil star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, AFP reports.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who play football in the Spanish league, a buy-out price of 222 million euros.
The $222 million transfer is the largest in football history.
Previously the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
The Spanish league put the brakes on the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first attempt to pay Neymar's representatives.
Under league rules, the buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In effect, PSG have paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who provided the money via the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home crowd at PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa to investigate details
In a statement, Barcelona also said it would provide details of the payment to European football's governing body Uefa so the federation can determine any disciplinary action arising from the incident.
Spanish league president Javier Tebas, among others, has suspected PSG of violating Uefa's financial fair play rules with their spending.
Uefa can sanction a club that makes more than €30m in losses over three years.
Uefa says Neymar's move does not automatically breach its financial regulations.
Neymar's move to PSG will have an impact on the club's finances for a number of years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell a number of players for substantial sums, a statement from Uefa said.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former professional tennis player, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Ten shirts for Neymar
Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike - flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing his usual work procedures for a plane at Lunch Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a lightning bolt from a rainy sky struck the plane.
The force of lightning threw Dunn, who was near the plane's wing, to the ground.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My dad called me and said my brother got electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I asked if she was still alive, Austin’s sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the infirmary.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You don't expect that.
It's traumatizing for everyone, Autumn tells me.
An airport spokesman said the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself would decide whether to comply.
Pearson to cut 3,000 jobs and revive business with dividend cut
Pearson, the British education group, announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and slash the dividend by 72 per cent as it embarked on a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019. The company already cut 4,000 jobs in connection with previous restructurings.
Pearson announced that it would cut expenses again by £300m in May as part of its third austerity programme to revive a business weakened as a result of rapid digitisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House publishing to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced it would keep its current year outlook unchanged. Its revenue grew 1 per cent in the first half of the year to £2.05bn.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Officials said a NATO soldier was killed and several others were wounded in the attack.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
Unconfirmed local reports said three civilians were also killed in the attack in Kabul's Qarabagh district.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's blast occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol came under attack with a "person-carrying homemade explosive device."
The statement said all of the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are significant concerns for Nato forces near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 percent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area predominantly populated by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in central Kabul in a bomb attack that was the country's deadliest attack by a militant faction since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the volatile situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether to send more U.S. troops to the country to help the local army and police.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's trust in the government, in the policies it pursues, and in particular in President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay implementation of smog provisions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay implementation of decisions made during the Obama administration to reduce smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone specifications" late Wednesday. The agency says the decision is a testament to its commitment to working with states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to meet the needs of the states," Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement issued by the agency.
Pruitt announced in June the agency's intention to delay implementation of ozone specifications for one year to October 2018. According to the specifications, smog pollution will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with even more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency was sued by 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia. They said it was illegal to delay implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to relax environmental regulations under Barack Obama. Trump says the measures are part of a broader agenda aimed at economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of rising emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing air containing ozone "can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of the Islamic State group had also sent bomb components to Sydney.
It is suspected the bomb was due to be taken on to a plane on 15 July, but the attempt was aborted before security checks were carried out.
Police would not elaborate on why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist scheme was one of the most professional schemes ever undertaken in Australia.
Suspected terrorist plots led to four men being taken into custody in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but questioning of him is also continuing.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes fell, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to President and CEO Matti Lievonen, the company performed well in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products reached record levels and the Marketing & Services segment’s operating profit developed in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year due to higher sales volumes and more favorable markets, even though the tax reduction ended.
Implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and will complete the previously announced strategic investments in 2017," Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss possible fight in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course toward the most interesting boxing match of the under-66.7-pound series in the near future, faced each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel's offices in Los Angeles until WBC undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won on Showtime on Saturday by unanimous decision over former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been in the top five on a list comparing boxers from different weight classes.
Garcia held out his right hand and asked, "How you doing, champ?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7 a.m. on Saturday.
As the two posed for photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that a match between the two men would be "perfect in terms of sizes."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up a set [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 pounds.
I want to get back to lightweight.
He has to step up to lightweight [61.2-pound]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans are hoping for.
Let's fulfill their wishes.'
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be held on a pay-per-view channel. It is part of a strategy he devised for Lomachenko, who will debut at lightweight later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight at lightweight at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight could be on a pay-per-view channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later announcing he was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
“I’ll do it as soon as I get an agreement.”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and might plan to go watch Saturday's fight.
Lomachenko stopped short of praising Garcia's flowy and said this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing punch power and then on boxing.
The two men said they felt there was an increasing desire for the fight between them to take place.
"This is the match we are looking forward to.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely on this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he had been looking forward to fighting the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match.'
Average salary 5,300 euros, education what happens - the investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been much talked about recently.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat reported on Ritva, 68, to whom a banker’s investment advisor spoke nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules governing investment advisers and various sales of investment products will be tightened early next year.
The strictures are based on the new MiFID, which will be applied from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the competence of investment advisers and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Services Authority (FA) itself recommends that those working in investment services take its own APV1 or APV2 exam.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of degrees for a company called APV-Investment Degrees Ltd, which has experts from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and operators in the field in its working group.
The exams are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Ltd, a provider of business management development services.
Its website says that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements."
The study material of the degrees includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, says that the passing rate of the exams is roughly 70 per cent.
Of the personnel of the largest banks, almost all investment service providers have completed either the APV1 or APV2 examinations, as they are mandatory under the companies’ own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers, without mentioning names, whose staff seem to have shunned taking degrees, Savikko says.
He said there were "a few" such bankers.
According to Saviko, between 13,000 and 14,000 people have completed the APV1 degree since 2000 and about 3,000 people have completed the more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors.
Some bankers consider taking a degree to be an advantage.
More than one other industry has significantly stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Industry requires that APV examinations be completed, because then it is the expertise related to the investment sector that is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisers earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of monthly wage earners are approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men earn more than 5,900 euros a month and women more than 4,500 euros.
The top 10 earners earn on average about €8,100.
A tenth of the highest-earning men earn more than €9,000 a month or more, a tenth of the highest-earning women earn €6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the employee and task level, there has so far been a reliance on self-regulation.
Fiva said the audit it carried out came up against individual cases where the investment adviser's professionalism and qualifications were not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's activities.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your skills and qualifications are at a low level.
First of all, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter skills requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, this will be tightened from the beginning of next year with the new MiFID II directive.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are adequately skilled.
The Financial Supervisory Authority will have the power to decide what to do.
Marko Hovi, market supervisor at FIN-FSA, explains that one of the clear changes to the current regulation is the requirements concerning the expertise and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both investment firms’ own staff and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the power to determine competence and experience.
Exactly what they are will be decided in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company must also ensure the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has a duty to prove that this is also the case.
The Court specifies that, in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel’s job descriptions on an individual level.
There will certainly be different standards for this, depending on whether it's investment advice or selling products.
According to the Court, it is also a new requirement to work for a certain period of time with someone more experienced if the skills or experience are not at an adequate level.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work for a certain amount of time with the person who meets the criteria.
According to Hovi, the change will make the rules stricter and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Photo: 787 Dreamliner passenger jet 'draws' giant plane over U.S.
The route flown by the aircraft was plotted over the United States by Flightradar24 service.
The flight was carried out Thursday on the 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines in long-haul flight.
The plane, which departed Seattle in 18 hours and 1 minute, flew 15,700 kilometers, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within U.S. borders throughout the trip.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra’s tenacious beach school children are not bothered by the rain or the sun - Iines Kaikkonen persistently polski with the help of a swimming pötkylä
Everything was moving at a good pace, and it was followed by it.
Imatra’s beach swimming schools run in Liette and Lempukka this week and next.
Even though it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers are not that bad, says Taina Itkonen, who runs swimming schools.
A total of 13 children will gain swimming skills at this week's swimming schools, up from a dozen next week.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that school and education will begin at that time, Itkonen estimates.
Imatra Beach Swimming School is organised in cooperation by the Sports Unite project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at the Slurry Beach.
The sun was shining and the young swim school students were working on staying afloat with swimming pools, someone already without.
Smaller siblings also thrived in the water.
He was 5 years old when he went deeper into the water.
However, he was encouraged by Taina Itkonen to walk towards the shore.
You're doing great!
He said he had been swimming a lot this summer.
Sludge beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen practiced swimming persistently with a swimming pole.
You should be happy with today’s results, too.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted to go to the water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who watched her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swim from the beach, sees the beach swimming school as a good start to learning how to swim.
No matter what the weather is like, Anna has loved coming here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
Swim school students packed into the dock.
The boys were busy with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked on fruit and basked in the day.
In the water, teaching continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
One that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier is selling toilet brushes - "Here's a sort of unifying story"
You see all sorts of things.
A couple of days ago, the cleaning products manufacturer Sinituote launched the Unknown Soldier product range.
I mean, dish brushes and laundry racks... and a "toilet brush with edge brush."
The Unknown Soldier refers to the film and the film’s marketing, which will premiere in the autumn.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been mooted on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are the film’s partner.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
He says there will be a special presentation for the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something funny about this - often when you think that products and the stories attached to them have something in common?
Yes, there is such a common story here that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his core Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not alien to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other corporate partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall’s Vichys, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been introduced to the market.
Unknown products were already gutted by Suomen Kuvalehti blogger Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time for a follow-up.
The unknown partners have not yet disclosed their war products, for example, Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
Results of Swedish asylum seeker age tests published
The latest results of the Swedish medical age tests for asylum seekers have been published. The results of the tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 per cent of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone regards the tests as reliable.
Sweden's national forensics agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of applicants claiming to be minors.
The Immigration Department has commissioned 6,880 tests so far, and the Bureau of Forensic Science has now released the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were conducted between mid-March and late July in 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, or 2002 asylum seekers, were determined to be over 18. In addition, the Bureau of Forensic Medicine determined in 25 cases that the person being tested was "possibly 18 or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18."
Tests were only carried out in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Bureau of Forensic Science says the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"The numbers are pretty consistent. There are no big differences from the statistics from previous months," he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over 18, it does not necessarily mean that applicants lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and reported that there were "indications that the subject is 18 or older" in 442 cases.
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it emerged that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people's biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it and I don't think the method used is the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't definitely determine the age, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Göransson, of the Bureau of Forensic Science, excused the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is highest in a situation where the test subject turns 18 years of age. The risk is then about 10 per cent."
Ilonen plummets 30 places in Scotland
A five-over-par score in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen 30 notches down the leaderboard in golf's European Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left Saturday in 11th place but was found to share 41st at the end of the round.
In the difficult weather, Ilonen was accompanied by one double bogie.
Others had a tough time, too.
Englishman Ian Poulter stepped up to share top spot with a one-under-par round, despite reporting that there was enough work to do in the umbrella-holdings.
It was brutal, but I hung in there and in the end it was a good day, Poulter thought.
He shares top spot with compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia governor switches parties
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he was switching parties.
"The Democrats simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflection...Today I am telling West Virginians that I can no longer help you as a Democratic governor."
The audience erupted in raucous applause.
"Tomorrow, a registered member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say to you, "It's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised a major announcement would be made at a campaign event in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining business from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that builds barriers rather than a better America."
"Democrats have just 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that lacks leadership of any kind and is unable to find a positive, people-unifying message," RNC Rep. Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
Flashes have sown damage - Thursday becoming even the toughest thundery day of the summer
By the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
During the past week there have been thunderstorms especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes sparked several fires.
A meteorologist said Thursday could become the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland.
The past week has seen lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
At Pöytyä, lightning struck the electrical centre of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
Emergency services received a report of a fire at around quarter past midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located at the end of the terraced house.
Emergency services dismantled the roof and wall to find firebreaks and quickly extinguished the blaze.
A total of eleven homes were left without power, but personal injury was avoided.
Once again, lightning set the outbuilding ablaze on Harjulantie before midnight.
By the time emergency services came to the scene, the building was in full fire stage and all the emergency services could do was prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding of about fifty square feet burned to the ground.
Once again, a lightning bolt struck the house.
Residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flare-up of lightning.
Emergency services visited the scene to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, a thunderstorm caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Reports of the fault were received between eight and nine on Thursday morning, after which trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem wasn't fixed until just before 5 p.m.
Since then, the train service has been able to continue normally also on the thunder-ravaged railway line.
Lightning has wreaked havoc across Finland.
But lightning has been comparatively low this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been absolutely miserable! estimates Meteorologist Jari Tuovinen, who is on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have mainly been moderate in intensity, but thanks to the small amount of lightning in the summer, it also feels even strong to many.
This might seem like a really hard thunderstorm, but that’s what it’s been compared to this summer’s thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, ground lightning blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had the potential for even the loudest thunderstorm of the summer: By about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 ground lightning flashes in the plackar.
If the lightning continues into the early evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm year was in 2015, when the year’s lightning total was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's lightning total had soared to 18,386 lightning.
So there's still more catching up to do to make sure this year doesn't break the "record" of two years ago.
But the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a favourable environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to shift southwards from the northern parts of the country for Saturday, where around 2,000 lightning days can be had on both Saturday and Sunday.
A more uniform rain front is in store for the central parts of the country.
According to these people, it is only infrequent.
Coe hails Russia's 'open-minded' apology over doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an open-minded apology by Russia over the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian Athletics Director Dmitry Shlyahtin said at the IAAF congress on Thursday on the eve of the World Championships that the ban received by Russia is appropriate and that he will fight doping with determination.
He said he felt sorry "for all the athletes who were deprived of a gold or silver medal in the competitions."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to extend the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report showed evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think his response today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country had gone through a difficult time and indicated that it would do everything possible to reorganize its activities."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the terms of ending the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendation that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete under neutral athlete status at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday. They have met the IAAF's strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet many requirements before its status could be restored.
"Testing remains inadequate, and coaches banned from operating continue to operate freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF council in London.
Production company disappointed by Tom of Finland film's lacklustre success
"Tom of Finland" was not the success the filmmakers had hoped for, Yle reports.
If I’m honest, I’m disappointed, admits the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was worried that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like that's what it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached more than 100,000 viewers, which is small compared to the film's budget of around five million euros.
We didn't win any lottery on this, but now it's important that investors get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful domestically, they would have already got their money's worth.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign distributions," Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is directed by Dome Karukoski.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
Restrictions on spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France. It is the most expensive player transfer ever in football.
Its possible sanctions on Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from taking part in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced the Fair Play Financial Rules in 2011, which state that PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros to end the Brazilian's contract, and Neymar's annual salary at the new club moves in the tens of millions of dollars.
There are a wide range of financial considerations surrounding Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer fee and adding him to their star roster, as the club is funded by the Qatari oil-rich dynasty.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums to acquire players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of revenue so that football-related business is not loss-making.
Fair play financial rules were drawn up at the initiative of Michel Platini, the Frenchman who was elected UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that pursuing success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play financial rules shifted from clubs" debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that implementation of the business model first used by Roman Abramovich at Chelsea in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year assessment period for Fairplay's financial rules runs until 2018. During that period, clubs are allowed to make a maximum of €30m in losses.
Although Platini was forced to step down as UEFA president in a scandalous 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of fair play financial rules at UEFA, told The Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract in a lump sum, it can amortise the amount in the accounts for the full duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual cost of €44.4 million for the next five years.
The first sanctions were handed out on the basis of fair play financial rules in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which is financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros, which was later reduced to 20 million euros. The club was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
For example, if a Qatari company subsidises PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above normal market levels, UEFA will not calculate the aid as actual revenue.
That was the case when UEFA ruled in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's support for PSG was overdone.
Reports have also emerged that some of Neymar's earnings at PSG might be funded by payments from Qatar's 2022 football World Cup organising committee.
But PSG and the organising committee have denied that Neymar is being made an ambassador for the World Cup. It would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Given PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA will be watching even more closely than usual attempts to skirt the rules.
Sources with knowledge of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA were not in talks with PSG over a move for Neymar.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identities not be disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
Last season's financial statements have not yet been released.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and boost sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent with the Neymar deal.
A clearly irritated by the departure of one of the world's best players, the Spanish league tried to make it difficult for Neymar to make the move. It was alleged to breach the financial rules of fair play.
"This is a clear financial doping case both for the club and the state," Spanish league president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS. At the state, he was referring to PSG's Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the environment in which football operates over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the government owns a football team.
Complying with the financial rules of fair play becomes very difficult. There are so many different interests involved in having a famous player representing the state."
Now we're in a hurry: Finland's World Cup athletes' coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching at the World Athletics Championships in London.
You may have to compete without your coach’s advice.
Pajulahti will compete in the long jump qualifier tomorrow and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump qualifier.
But the duo's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not been able to get a visa to the UK.
Mr Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in a major British broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from World Cup organisers as a document, but even that has not qualified for a visa.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or what," coaching director Jorma Kemppainen said.
He has always handled visa issues himself successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for many years.
It doesn't make that much of a difference.
As long as someone looks at the step markers in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible omission.
World Cup medal for FinlandLondon takes a miracle
The World Athletics Championships begin in London today, Friday, and run for just over a week, ending on Sunday, August 13.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are among the sports that Finnish athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of the athletes on the bench, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one championship to the next, where experience is gained to mature an athlete’s performance to the level where an adult World Championship medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup squad, nor, admittedly, any old-timers.
A World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising thing about sports is that miracles can happen.
It draws bench athletes to the television screen and glues them to watch the Games, although London's medals will not be decided until late at night due to the time difference.
At the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was a long-winded, long-winded ride.
The daredevils are expecting a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although another indication is his and other throwers' recent results and Pitkämäki's failure to qualify in last summer's standings.
No matter what happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes, getting to the finals or setting their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for the coming years of Finnish athletics will give a good success in the international youth championships this summer as well.
Breeding young talent and supporting its work financially is more important than maintaining a small elite pool of representative athletes.
Success doesn't come instantly but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from coaching and bench athletes alike.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will go down in history as the Usain Bolt and Mo Farah Games, and not because of things like terrorism deterrence or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The runner-up spot at Copper Mountain is the best in Ruka Lake's big air world cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
He tried caballerial 1080 for the first time at the Games on his final jump, and it came very close to succeeding.
I feel good and feel good now, but I’m sorry that the last jump didn’t go well.
I will try again from now on, Rukajärvi.
In snowboarding's big air, a contestant jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line’s new express ship left in port in Helsinki
Viking’s new FSTR is running far behind schedule.
The express ship was supposed to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was about eight months in the process of being loaded.
The boat arrived late in Helsinki.
For at least an hour and a half I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the queue of cars is moving a bit, Johannes Rebane from Estonia, who is waiting to board at the Port of Helsinki, told me at 7.30 p.m.
Mr Rebane thought there had been a technical fault with the new vessel.
Mr Rebane said the shipping company had brought bottles of water for those waiting to get on board in their cars.
Viking’s Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from the return trip to Tallinn by a couple of hours.
The ship was supposed to depart from Tallinn back to Helsinki at 8.15pm.

Small-circuit nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story spans both the glory days of the 80s and the grunge of the 90s (in those days, David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing a great sketch show for MTV) and their own time – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the show moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it's both a parody and a description of the constant reminiscence we're stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels out of date.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not only because of its absurd humor (it told, among other things, the backstory of a vegetable can speaking in the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
The gist of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teenagers approaching adulthood. Highlighting it makes the impossibility of reaching for the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotion-based, and its parody is more disjointed: it parodies 90s stalker flicks, for example, such as the horror film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
At one point, one of the characters unearths an Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
The kind-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but is still not over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one wacky plot involves Ronald Reagan (as well as Michael Showalter) as his partner in crime, George H.W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It's particularly fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd with a beard tuft under his lower lip, aka Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from Singles. Played by Rudd, Andy, the camp kingpin, is getting old geezer.
Moments of random madness may put this series on the air as a kind of recursive Seven Up! until it reaches its apparent conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's "Comrade Detective" series, on the other hand, invokes a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of "The Americans," "Atomic Blonde" and even the wrestling imagery of the GLOW series, where East meets West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy series is directed by Rhys Thomas. It's made into a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a pair of Bukarestian cops fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring as tough-guy Gregor and idealistic Iosef are Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (the show's lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But much else it is not.
The show has some good visual jokes (cops spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Commodore Detective gets too caught up in imitating clumsy socialist drama – there’s a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, for example. That’s why the show often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
The six long episodes are too long, and the show's humor is neither fast nor plentiful enough.
In summary, the show might work better as an agitprop satire, say, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US embassy and there are always two fat men gorging on burgers in the lobby.
The message to an imagined communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The show's fictional Romanian creators weren't wrong: we were numbly devouring our own recent history and theirs, too.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru will take to the ring in Macau on Saturday - facing the former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru will have a tough bone to pick in Macau as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting in the UFC organisation last year.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsu black belt and the sport's world championship.
For once, I'm fighting myself older.
It's a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru tells me.
Kouvolalainen was supposed to take to the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was called off due to logistical problems, but the three struggles were caught on a fast-track schedule to China's autonomous region of Macau.
Taurus has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my fight was cancelled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
But the fighter is pleased that a new date for the struggle has been set.
Waiting a week doesn't make much of a difference to your preparation.
The move doesn't affect fitness, as it doesn't improve in a week.
It can get worse if you exercise too much.
Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in fighting in the past few battles.
This time the situation is different.
Issa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
My guess is he'll come on hard in the first round and try to take to the mat.
He's won the World Jujutsu Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
Kouvola’s previous match did not go according to plan.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, leaving the victory to the Philippines.
I've never fought that well especially up front: he didn't get any hits.
When I left to pour, he hit the corner of my eye.
It really upset me for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the MMA fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more densely.
For example, Issa, a future opponent, last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
We are now facing another struggle this year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten heavy.
I have been training over the last few years and have been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for the sake of fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a while.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy back.
We got some really good training sessions with one guy from Sweden as well.
Training was a big help, because on Saturday the Kouvola resident will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've had the opportunity to train against opponents of similar stature and practice vertical.
Fighting upright is the 32-year-old's main tactic.
You've got to bat sensibly.
If I get the chance, I will go to the park myself.
Downpours should not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who has fought in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think it's going to be a big, great night.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25 percent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged after a lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation has ended speculation about rate hikes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow. The Bank moved rate hikes because of increased pressure on families" income levels.
The decision-makers of the central bank’s monetary policy committee voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%. This month the increase received even less support due to the lack of economic growth.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and its 2018 forecast to 1.6%. It also warned that household incomes will come under even more pressure as inflation is still expected to pick up to close to 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank said that interest rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit. In addition, the Bank indicated that borrowing costs may have to be increased by more than expected in financial markets.
In addition, members of the commission decided to cancel part of a massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide £15m more, or £115m in total, to banks through the programme.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate decision state: "The Monetary Policy Commission's forecast suggests that the slow pace of gross domestic product will continue over the next few years as lower real household incomes reduce consumption."
On interest rates, the Bank reiterated that a "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" was needed to curb inflation "a little more broadly" than market expectations.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases will be "gradual" and "limited."
In May, the bank forecast growth of 1.9 percent for this year and 1.7 percent for next year.
It now kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and euro following the news.
Against the dollar, the pound weakened 0.5 per cent to $1.31. Against the euro, it weakened 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker-than-expected growth figures dampened increased expectations for rate hikes. GDP grew 0.3 percent in the second quarter and 0.2 percent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 percent in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and meagre pay rises. The Bank says the situation will get even worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" incomes from falling over the next few years. However, it expects that wage growth will recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be bolstered by strong growth in demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound. It will reverse some of the impact of falling private consumption.
The decision was taken a year after interest rates were cut to 0.25 per cent following a shock EU referendum result that plunged the pound.
The bank reckons that the overall impact of the decision is not likely to start to show up in prices and the economy until four years from now.
Ahead of the central bank's latest decision, calls for rate hikes had become increasingly loud as inflation ratcheted up pressure on households. Three policymakers called for a 0.5 percent rate hike in July.
Inflation eased to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June. However, the Bank said it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
The bank said its 2 per cent overshoot of the target level was "entirely due" to the weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market would appear to be intensifying further as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The market is looking particularly good for those whose current loan deal is coming to an end. Renewal deals are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no-expense options available."
NHS to prescribe 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
From September, patients can be prescribed a "turnaround" anti-HIV drug. A dispute over the drug's funding in England's public health system (NHS) was concluded in the Supreme Court.
The NHS announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) will be prescribed to around 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. A drug taken before intercourse has been found to reduce the risk of transmission by around 86 per cent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld last year's judgment by the High Court. It says the NHS will be able to pay for the PrEP drug, despite arguing that it should be funded by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday a "significant new intervention," and the national AIDS charity described it as a "decisively important moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to start accepting enrolments for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine taken before intercourse that reduces the risk of transmission.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in high-risk groups.
The drug taken before intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with an HIV-positive partner who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics will select eligible applicants from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to be receiving antiretroviral therapy for their disease.
People living in England and registered with a GP can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10m, and the NHS in England this week signed a procurement contract for the drugs after an international tender.
The trial is designed to assess the potential of the PrEP drug by gathering extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, taking and treatment implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the diverse and increasingly effective means already in place to prevent HIV," said Stevens.
"It's yet another remarkable achievement in a battle that has been going on for more than 30 years to tackle one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is correctly targeted at those who need it and those at risk, it could have an epochal impact on England's HIV epidemic.
From September, those at risk will receive a drug, through an NHS-funded trial, that they can decide on independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
That was welcome news.”
"The priority now is to ensure that the trial is launched quickly across the country and no one at risk is excluded," said Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug being used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that was prolonged in vain by several months due to government slowing down," says Sharon Hodgson, the shadow cabinet secretary for health.
"We have evidence that the drug can have an epochal impact on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The trial will help us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
Quality of life: the mezzanine floor and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker enthusiastic about property renovations, moved from a residential area of Knightsbridge to a smaller flat in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a Queen Anna-style house. The success of the renovation is evidenced by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed up her things and moved in.
"Before this, my ex and I lived in a considerably larger flat in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went to an apartment display here and found that the rooms were as high as they were in my apartment at the time.
I loved it and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, the roughly 90-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete makeover.
It was a two-room apartment where the bedroom could only be accessed from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space as well as a mezzanine floor to make the most of the room height.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from Duck & Shed, a design agency in Notting Hill. Erfan was tasked with making the most of the space in the nearly four-metre-high rooms and creating an apartment that would not just be a subject for renovation and sale but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build a mezzanine floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking on Erfan's part.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The spaces had to be arranged on top of each other so that there was no need to cower in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both on top of them and underneath."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space with fascinating details.
On the mezzanine floor, a Retrouvius copper-crusted window opens to a sleek lounge.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a signature style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than the real thing.
A mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window overlooking another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Adding to the elegance is the fact that you can hide the kitchen when you're not using it.
Folding-door kitchens are not a new solution,
but what's unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as a garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan tells me of the steel-reinforced veneer-surfaced MDF door.
"It's balanced, meaning it slides very easily into place when lifted."
With sensible use of space and planning for storage, Joanne got 16 extra square metres, a second bedroom and an even better layout.
"When selling a home, it's the acreage that counts – or the valuation of the property," says Erfan.
"Basically, an estate agent walks into an apartment and calculates the price based on surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly created based on them," Erfan says.
"No one's getting attached to the electrical wires that go through the walls.
They're important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's flat is an example of how good design and extra square metres can make a basic flat exceptionally fine.
It may also mean that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia beamed in her summer look
Princess Sofia's outfit choice hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before giving birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had opted for a delicate pale blue dress.
Sofia was smiling on the occasion.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
During the day on Wednesday, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow at the seminar in a stunning blue body-con outfit that put on a gorgeously-pregnant princess at her last.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue ensemble.
This is the last representation event Sofia will represent before giving birth.
His due date is in September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen to wear a beautiful pastel blue dress, which landed magnificently.
The style was topped off with large earrings and a sleek little bag.
The pastel blue dressed the princess nicely.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia completed her outfit with a little bag.
Sofia just beamed in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even went to the event to talk to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," Sofia stated, laughing, referring to her final pregnancy.
He's raising us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a stall selling Thai food appeared in the Lahti market.
They didn’t dare to taste it, they just walked by.
In the stall, food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttila, among acquaintances Panja.
He didn’t know much Finnish, and Finns didn’t know Thai at that time.
Because people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the bayers to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste the lands, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more often, in the end, every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his Thai diner in Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats for customers.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and have limited seats, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at a plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by on the market hall side, but then the restaurant had to move because I was told the self-made spice pastes smelled too much in the hall.
At the end of the market, a new location was vacant.
There's room.
Now we yobs get to sit at our own tables again, only at the most congested times do we have to shyly ask guests if there's space next to us.
Panja knows his customers.
He'll be briefed on where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how the customers’ life stages vary and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went with to eat my first spring rolls.
She remembers me being thin and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit next to my kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans against the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened our minds and our hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he has had a hard time, he is always kind.
He's a hard worker.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes mushroom and blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated two decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention went this momentous day, at work.
Discovery of Underground Base Reveals 173 Isis Terrorists Poised to Strike in Europe
Early this year, security officials got their hands on a major list for counterterrorism work.
The list includes the details of more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 individuals and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the place where the list was found and the information it contained have become more detailed.
The newspaper said Iraqi army special forces discovered the list containing the terrorists' personal details and pictures while searching the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the papers' authenticity and sent them on to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
There was an underlying fear that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the individuals, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also details the specialties of terrorists.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list says Abu Assid al-Almani, or German, as the battle name.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later, via Turkey, to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
A suicide bomber is written next to his picture as a specialty.
The fate of the man is not known.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have left Europe for ISIL, whose fate is uncertain.
Man sinks below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on interviews with the rescue service, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person was rescued from the water in Tokoinranta, Helsinki on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the on-call fire marshal of the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the report.
An emergency services diver found him below the surface, Estlander says.
Emergency services received a report after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of emergency medical services.
Estlander says it was a man in his mid-50s.
According to interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a border patrol operation.
Those present also provided excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with Border Force and police.
Two passenger cars collide in Eura - nine people in the cars, three seriously injured
A total of nine people were in the cars, with the rest suffering minor injuries, according to the fire marshal on duty.
Both men and women are among the injured.
The accident happened at the intersection of three roads around 4 a.m.
The crash occurred when another car flipped from behind a warning triangle in front of another car, according to the fire marshal on duty.
Emergency services said there was an 80km/h speed limit at the junction.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate assets
The two brothers are in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest property empires, worth more than $500 million. The dispute relates to the family business their Italian family founded 40 years ago.
Former Carlton Football Club chairman and property developer Colin De Lutis lives in Toorak's value district just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court the dispute over the division of property and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the split is the subject of bitter controversy.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began accumulating fortune when they bought the store on Collingwood's Smith Street in 1973.
The family set up a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The store chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on property, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento and apartments in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
Under an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul owns about a third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as "the driving force and central figure in the family."
According to court documents, the asset-sharing ratio means Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns properties worth about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of the properties and the money.
"In my opinion, Colin left the best properties to himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard in the Supreme Court last Friday for the first time after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of the business.
Colin says this claim is untrue, that he blames Paul for the mismanagement of some properties.
In one of his first affidavits, Colin writes that he would like to reach a resolution in the case.
"In keeping with our Italian traditions, family is most important to me," Colin states in a statement.
The costs of the case keep mounting. There are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports. There are consulting firms like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer working on the case, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, like Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a shop in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin set up the family's first denim shop.
Colin says he set up the store "in the last years of high school when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna writes in a statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
Paul said Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial terms of his departure."
Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former Australian Football League club board member and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and in his text message, he said he couldn't really comment on the matter because it was being dealt with in court.
"It is with great sadness that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family's name into the legal battle," she wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way," Colin continued, saying he still hoped a resolution could be reached.
On Friday, hope appeared to have been extinguished.
"Our case will be decided in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the new White House chief of staff plans to limit President Trump's media use and news monitoring to keep the boss from getting into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day on the job, he brought up a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House staffers that all information, whether printed or heard in briefings, must go through him because the president makes better decisions when he is well informed."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have also tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If President-elect Trump became nervous about unfair coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media outlets were handling things more equitably," Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to Trump's campaign, told Politico magazine in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign staffers say it's essential in managing Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media flow include a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it's ludicrous to suggest that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't - maybe without their efforts, Trump's tweets would have been even wilder.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff have even been able to stop him from causing trouble a few times, their work has not been in vain.
But no one has been able to consistently stop Trump from causing a stir.
The problem stems in part from the fact that there are competing factions in the White House trying to push their case by providing Trump with information that supports their point of view. That information may or may not be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote that advisers deliberately provide questionable information to the president.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on one case:
"Trump's current and former staffers say that he can be hugely infuriated by newspaper clippings criticising him – especially if they report harmful leaks of information. Then he is absolutely obliged to know where the information came from.
That's what happened in late February, when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of a news story on GotNews.com, a Web site founded by the online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Katie Walsh, the deputy chief of staff, of multiple White House leaks of information.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and had previously spread false accusations and later retracted them. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had started asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "had tried to put in place a document management system that goes to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his aides are still pursuing their own issues.
These immutable facts make Kelly's task very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazil star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, AFP reports.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid FC Barcelona, who play football in the Spanish league, a buy-out price of 222 million euros.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated, and he was free to move to Paris club PSG.
The $222 million transfer is the largest in football history.
Previously the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros for Frenchman Paul Pogba last summer.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former professional tennis player, Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the shape of my life"
Raija Oranen, the best-selling author known for her TV series Ruusu's Time and Pure White Sheets, just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
The five grandchildren keep such a hold on grandma along with writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left a rental apartment.
In the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raija was once taken by depression and alcoholism, from which she has survived.
The exterior is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went off when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-depressants.
I was helped with alcoholism by hypnosis, which also helped me overcome my fear of flying.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, a beaming writer says candidly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been travelling together for over 45 years.
I'm better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the travel industry, have been travelling together for over 40 years.
I asked her to marry me in two weeks, and she laughed.
She’s always been the queen of drama, she’s always stopped living that life, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made an extensive career as a writer, only remembers the 44-part Pure White Sheets TV series that touched and moved Depression-era Finland.
I finally decided on the clothing industry as the business of the Fresh Family when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th-anniversary interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed Finns’ attitude towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives an active life as a writer, she has many scripts in the pipeline - hundreds of ideas.
Circulators back across ditch in 'millionaires' alley'
Homeowners in some of the wealthiest parts of the West Midlands are once again getting their hair licked by dogged itinerants who managed to cross a ditch needed by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
Circulators parked their two dozen caravans near a street called Millionaire's Alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May but managed to cross a moat the municipality needed as a barrier. They brought children, horses and an army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the access barrier at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Outraged residents have accused the municipality of Solihull of a "complete inability to solve the problem."
The resident, who remains anonymous, says the orbiters came from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they had been pelting passers-by with stones.
"The local authority has to be toughed up to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The orbiters were here in May, then they went away but came back again.
There were more of them tonight and probably even more today."
A resident said the Birmingham municipality had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating paying council tax when the local authority is unable to do anything about it."
Another resident, who remains anonymous, said it was ridiculous that the orbiters returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before. They've even landed a horse in a grazing park."
A spokesman for Solihull council said the local authority was aware of illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are in the process of taking the necessary legal action with Solihull police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
It is very important for evidence gathering that as many local people as possible report disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It will help to build a complete picture of the situation for judicial review."
Enraged people surround Portugal crash plane
The men who crash-landed on a beach full of people in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people died as a result of the crash yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could face manslaughter charges.
The maximum sentence for this is 16 years in prison in Portugal.
The small plane the men were flying had to make an emergency landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica, near Lisbon, yesterday because of a technical fault.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom were running from the descending plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl when it landed, killing them instantly.
The plane hit a man with his back to the plane first.
Immediately afterward, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, Filipe Janeira, who was on the beach, told the newspaper Jornal de Noticias.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
People on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash in anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and began beating the back of it, said Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, in the newspaper Correio da Manha.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle more people didn't die.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash landing.
Finnish star who tragically lost his leg wins another World Cup gold: "Without the accident I wouldn't be world champion"
Early on Wednesday morning Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated World Championship gold in a banked slalom in Big White, Canada.
Greater Hamari also won the World Cross Championship gold earlier in the Games.
In all, three World Cup titles have already been won.
It's a pretty incredible World Cup!
Twice we took care of the gold, a pretty good heart rate is drawn, Suur-Hamari, reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and his very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is growing all the time.
The whole thing has been growing and developing a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's going to be a black horse behind you.
Every race seems to have a different winner.
Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
Since he was young, he had counted eagerly with his friends, and the accident did not make him want to get on the slope.
Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like without this accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's pointless ifs and buts.
The cards that have been dealt will be played, Greater Hamari stresses.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and Greater Hamari does not.
But he turned a gruesome hardship to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned a profit.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion if it wasn't for the accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Greater Hamar's greatest boarding zeal was already waning.
It was only after the accident that the work towards the summit really took off.
I trained with friends when I was young, and we were always excited about X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dimmed somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there at the start of X-Games.
I could not have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought it was going to be a really long life if I stayed here feeling bitter and sad.
I decided to pull on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased with the selection of wheelchair reeler Leo-Pekka Tähti as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympian received his award at a sports gala in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal for the parasports crowd.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
I'm sure this will also open eyes to the parasport world.
When is it time to launch two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar’s athlete of the year campaign?
We will see in due course.
I'm trying to do my best to be successful.
As yet, Greater Hamari has not conquered all the peaks it covets.
Next year will be a big goal.
A year from now, the Paralympics will take place in South Korea.
Let's go get a medal!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
They say the end of the war in Syria and ISIS leaving the country are the most important things that should happen for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing change to the conflict in Syria.
The communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international survey.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
A total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18 to 24 responded to the survey in February-March 2017, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents may think they will return to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, the decision of young people to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) see the end of the war as the factor most affecting permanent homecoming, while a quarter think it would be most important for ISIS to leave the country.
Fewer than one-tenth put the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the main factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked what factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that an end to the war is more important than President Bashar al-Assad’s relinquishment of power.
Just over a quarter see al-Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter believe in resolving the conflict by military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see ISIS's power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feel its power has been strengthened.
Respondents say the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is for the media to pass on information to people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many raised military measures as well as education reform as the primary means.
One-tenth said the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change under the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four think the conflict in Syria will get worse under Trump.
Opinions are split on whether the involvement of Russia as well as Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the web organized - a database he developed is used by people such as Wikipedia and Google
MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs absolutely nothing to users and can be developed online by any eminent programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With databases, vast masses of data remain organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and the images are also linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is MariaDB's chief technology officer, spends about half his time coding.
The man who works remotely from Kauniainen makes sure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, together with David Axmark of Sweden.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later software giant Oracle gobbled up Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal happened, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to do a job for Oracle that didn't make a definite promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this point, which began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired two dozen of the best developers from Sun to ensure that the continuity of the code is secured with the help of the same guys who created it.
Because MySQL is an open-source database, MariaDB was able to develop it into its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was set up to oversee the development of MariaDB's code.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius frets.
Although many people have heard of Widenius and MySQL, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50 percent a year," said Kenneth Paqvalén, MariaDB's chief financial officer.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is scant on the company's key figures.
He reveals that in the current financial year MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can take more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among others, Spanish operator Telefónica and DBS, Southeast Asia's largest bank, are among MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections with the biggest players.
"Among our customers are some of the world's largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
Even for Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared with the company's traditional closed database.
While research firm Gartner says the biggest database companies have been losing market share in recent years, in terms of revenue, gamblers like MariaDB are still negligible, if fast-growing, Sints.
In the roughly $50 billion database market, open source databases don't reach even a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, because the majority of users pay nothing for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018, companies will be developing more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open databases at that time or the transition would have been at least started.
Big companies won't get new customers because most will choose open source next.
This has led to licence fees for commercial databases jumping to the clouds.
The companies want to make as much money as they have in the past with a smaller number of customers," Widenius reflects.
Because of the hassle of changing a closed database, the majority of client companies have obediently swallowed the price rises.
"There are a lot of customers for whom the transition is really difficult because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
Still, he believes the measure of customers is coming full circle.
As license fees rise every year, the customer sooner or later moves to an open-source database.
The price is 10 to 20 percent of what it used to be, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Many companies are also facing major system changes as they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received 25 million euros in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest EIB growth financing ever granted to the Nordic countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and now plans to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The firm has public sector clients in countries such as Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
"Many countries want to move to open-source solutions and so use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius regrets how Finland spends money on, for example, closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some people say open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to do code.
The community is helping and doing what they can't think of or can't do themselves.
Along with another Finn, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, the 55-year-old Widenius is among the most well-known promoters of open source.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give four to five speeches a year around the world on this subject.
Italy toughens stance on NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees on its ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue operating unless they commit to complying with new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGOs do not commit to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German aid group Jugend Rettet. Its crew is suspected of working with people smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has been operating for just a year, declined to comment on the detailed charges laid by prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will continue to be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in a statement posted on social media.
"We will only be able to assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's Iuventa vessel since Oct.
The crew is suspected of taking on board boatloads of refugees directly from people smugglers who were able to re-use the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a couple of kilometres off the Libyan coast, according to a prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of defying the Italian coast guard, which is overseeing rescue efforts in the area. The motive is thought to be a zeal to help.
According to the code of conduct, vessels such as the Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who will oversee the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue effort have so far agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS, and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they will not cause "significant changes or barriers" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those refusing to comply with the code of conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, meanwhile, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of the rescue effort has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as an indication that efforts to strengthen Libya's coast guard and work with local mayors are beginning to yield results.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to resume talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing common-law husband on Enontekiö, suspect found off-road - case for prosecutor
The alleged crime took place last December in Kuttanen, Enontekiö.
Police say a 36-year-old man from the Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish common-law husband.
It has previously been reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said the suspect fled with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the grounds and did not resist when apprehended.
Charges in the case must be filed within less than a week.
The case may still be heard in the District Court of Lapland in August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-Hairy Friends, has died
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in theatre.
During his long career, he also acted in films and television.
Hardy will be particularly remembered for playing the Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffees in the Harry Potter films, as well as his veterinary role in the All-Hairy Friends television series based on James Herriot's book.
The popular BBC series was filmed for seven seasons in all.
Michelle Carter jailed for text messages inciting suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for text messages and phone calls she was deemed to have used to incite her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on parole.
Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in June. Her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is devastated," Conrad's father said at Thursday's hearing.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter filed an appeal against the conviction and was allowed to wait for the application to be heard at liberty.
He was facing a 20-year sentence, but his lawyers say both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured jumper, Carter listened to his verdict with his arms crossed with a weepy look created on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not accepted responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's attorney said the case stemmed from "shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Moniz ruled that neither Carter's "age or level of maturity, nor even mental health problems, had a significant impact on what he did."
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, who told him that "not a day goes by that I don't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want her to be able to be proud of me and how I am coping with all of this. I will try my best to comfort her sisters in this pain we will always carry."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court she was "persecuted" by the thought of never seeing her brother's wedding and not being an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never let up," Camdyn said.
The case appears to set a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that makes it a crime to incite suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case drew national attention when it emerged that Carter had incited her boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in the many messages he had sent to Roy in the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You've got to do it, Conrad" and "You've just got to turn on the generator, and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death. The judge ordered that Carter not profit from the incident by giving interviews.
The case has divided experts.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion piece by Knox in which she states, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail."
NATO Secretary-General: Relations with Russia worst since Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped to pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Stoltenberg said NATO was still committed to keeping tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid an escalation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump has thanked Congress for its poor relations with Russia, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi to make changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to setback experienced by carmakers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The BMW executive said the company believes "there are more sensible options than driving restrictions." He pointed to European cities, including BMW's home city of Munich, that are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it would make changes to more than 3 million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies talked about the recall.
European carmakers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet carbon emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The cost of installing equipment that neutralises emissions is rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German carmakers are under intense scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of pandering to big car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions to meet regulations in tests. In regular driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but the executives' actions are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he could be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation involving Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could evade European emissions requirements. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car maker's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately large.
Venezuelan vote sparks fraud investigation, big rallies to follow
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least 1 million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion by a firm that has no role in the election result," National Electoral Commission chairman Tibisay Lucenan told reporters.
Maduro assures crisis will end
Venezuela on Sunday elected a representative body in a controversial vote that is supposed to amend the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own rallies so that they would be under way at the time of the appointment.
El Pais newspaper said the country's national security forces began taking control of the country's parliament building on Wednesday evening local time.
The troops are supposed to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change. With them, spring and especially autumn rainfall has decreased markedly," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, an agricultural research institute in Provence.
"This shortens the life of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area, which spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought-after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of long cobs and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer essential oil-containing parts."
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a protective mix of clay and water. In addition, more drought-resistant varieties are being developed.
Murder of Journalist Embodies Growing Threat in Mexico
The editorial board of the once-weekly Riodoce newspaper usually meets Wednesday to discuss how the paper handles the latest cases involving organized crime, corrupt authorities and the interminable drug war in Sinaloa state.
Today, however, safety is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been told to change their daily routines.
Two seasoned reporters discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them with them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters for names for each group. No evidence is required, observations and sensations are sufficient.
Names of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels are written on the board. They are criminals who make news coverage of the chaos in Mexico life-threatening.
Violence is incessant, increasingly targeting journalists. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
Among the latest victims is Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and inspiration for Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, though he is omnipresent. The facade of the building in Riodoce is covered by a huge picture showing Valdez with a middle finger. The image reads: "Justice." Journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, in their 30s, are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez wears glasses and a trademark panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death. Reporters will discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears that have escalated into paranoia.
A federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 specifically to handle journalists' cases, but only two charges have been filed so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Murderers of journalists are rarely tried, as are thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and the situation is even more dangerous.
Ibarra said the security meeting is of limited use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left Riodocé in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven only a couple of blocks in his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50.
He is survived by a wife and two adult children.
Rumours are moving fast and running freely in Culiacan.
Valdez's death, however, is being muzzled.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlegrounds since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the U.S. in January. Rival factions want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and the cemetery houses the ornate two-story burial buildings of drug barons, larger than the homes of many.
In a coastal state, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
While Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his job, Riodoce's founder and director, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of a rival faction waging war against Guzman's sons.
The story may have angered Guzman's sons: Customers suspected of being gang members bought every issue of the paper as soon as the paper hit the outlets.
Another mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country after another paper with the same story came under attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had had a long career at Noroeste when, in 2003, he and five colleagues decided to set up Riodoce. The paper's shares were selling for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem," Bojorquez tells me.
In time, the magazine became known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the paper that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in relentlessly following the story of Mexico's drug trade.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said as he received an award from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“A journalist must accept a task that falls to him – or act stupid.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
The staff at Riodoce miss Valdez – a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to cope.
They relied on his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routine was his downfall.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best to do their jobs and stay alive.
"Criminals won't like it if we cover their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trafficking runways in our cases.
They were excluded from the cases," says Bojorquez.
It meant, at best, strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Trust your own instincts.
If you feel like everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "the impression can fail, and that's what happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, reports had emerged that only spyware sold to governments had tracked activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had taken shelter in the shade of a tree from the 40-degree heat.
They had been ordered by the state government to guard Riodoce's premises, which are housed in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Some of the reporters half-jokingly guessed whether it was these two police officers who were among the 50 percent who the state governor didn't think were trustworthy.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's editorial team envisaged three main stories.
The brother of boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also planned to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just blocks from the prosecutor's office, a group of people were kidnapped.
There was no official word on who had been kidnapped and how, so tread carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug traffickers and authorities.
A journalist discovered from public records that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). The PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for nearly a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in much-publicised cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents at the same location. In one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they were getting reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez's column.
"In the past, we would have already known what had happened," says Villarreal, 46, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco," Thinner, because of his slim physique.
"Now all communications with our sources of information are down."
Valdez's study has been turned into a warehouse to store signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The paper's employees have been given a new, unexpected task: They have become activists advocating press freedom.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her as she headed to a rally outside the local prosecutor's office the next morning, prompted by yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests conducted by authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest louder across the country. In demonstrations, "SOS Press" texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, leader Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to win international support for an investigation into the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with Sinaloa's governor and accused authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from cases dealing with the government out of concern that he is unable to be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly noted that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organized crime, crime-permitting authorities and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
Articulo 19, a watchdog group, said more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were the work of police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
The murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a note signed by the Zetas cartel: "I am here for my writings."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to shut down, such as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, like Nuevo Laredo's El Manana, even though its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on its front page to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the country as a whole.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on your guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals will seek out a journalist, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexico City apartment in 2015 three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra – who was once going to be a poet – admits that writing about drug dealing scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he tells me.
Not long ago, Riodoce reporters sat in front of a delivery on Friday at midnight on the sidewalk with a beer as the latest issue of the magazine was completed. Suddenly, their phones began vibrating to signal the message.
A shootout between rival gangs and security forces in the beach resort of Mazatlan had left 19 people dead.
The war escalated, as promised in cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on Riodoce's Web site from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be redone the next day.
Sirens wailed nearby – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it up very well.
Riodoce's editorial team continued the tradition of the magazine's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger to all of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down operations. "How could I shut down a magazine when our intern asked to go out on the street and still do a story the same day Javier had been murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Tough place"
The celebrations of Hannu Manninen, who turned 39 in April, were short-lived, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
But the training season began disastrously when Manninen contracted the flu.
That was the start of a long period of illness that stretched for nearly five weeks.
In May, I was almost completely sick.
First it was the flu and finally it was a pediatric disease like an ear infection that I had to take a course of antibiotics for.
I was only able to do ten per cent of the planned exercises.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick for that long.
It was hard when I couldn’t take advantage of the training passion, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapses
The 2007 world champion didn't get a training permit until the second week of June, which was evident in the roll mat test conducted by the Center for Racing and Excellence Research (KIHU) on June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis on roller skis on a mat whose speed is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester uses a needle from the athlete's fingertip to take a lactic acid sample.
Last fall, I did 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
It hit the wall, Manny said.
For the better
After the initial difficulties, Manninen says he remained healthy.
I have been doing a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to try to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period behind us.
There was also a week-and-a-half of flight time.
I also had time with my family to go to the cottage.
Last season, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening race when Manninen moved up to 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn up
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We're looking for a different rhythm to training now compared to last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have three World Cups this weekend.
In December, the plan would be to be involved in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
In late January, plans would still be in place for Seefeld.
“Hopefully, after that, the name will be on the Olympic roster,” Manninen said.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Manninen's sixth career Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela-based underscorer who celebrated gold in the team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Dinosaur Protects Its Enemies by Disguising Itself
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts are calling it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had been so well preserved that scientists were even able to define that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had had a "problematic past."
According to the journal Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur of all time and among the best of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the mid-Cretaceous period 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable find.
According to National Geographic magazine, the armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
There, the beast was excavated for six years from a 1,100-pound boulder.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you squint your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep," says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It will go down in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Studies of the skin revealed that meat-eating dinosaurs likely posed a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter coloration on the top, which is still found in many animals.
Experts say this allowed it to better mix with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaurus made headlines in May, and is now on display at the Royal Paleontological Museum in Tyrrell.
Scientists have named it the Borealope markmitchelli, after museum technician Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to excavate the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has been so amazingly preserved that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by the colouring common in the animal world, where the body is darker on top and lighter underneath.
Still, the sighting was a surprise because the Borealope is significantly larger than today's animals, which have a similar coloration.
It suggests that meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favoured hiding as a means of survival over fighting.
Among modern animals, for example, deer, zebras and armadillos have a similar coloration. They are significantly smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that the nodosaur was also seriously threatened.
"The predation of a large, heavily armoured dinosaur tells you how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaurs were," says Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions about its life, including examining the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died it fell into a river and drifted out to sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was as warm then as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas likely extended much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly skin has been preserved and it has also been preserved in three dimensions in its original form," notes Brown.
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous
It doesn't take much imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little at the eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The Cretaceous was the age of theropods, huge bipedal, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before the Borealopeltah, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armoured dinosaur.
Tyrannosaurus rex's predecessors, for example, included Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 meters long.
The latest findings from the Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe the Borealope was washed out to sea after his death and mummified in mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
The museum says it is the world's best preserved armoured dinosaur with skins and armour from snout to hip.
The nodosaurs averaged five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two six-foot spikes rose from their pallets.
Scientists believe this armored vegetarian passed through what is now Western Canada until a flooded river carried it offshore.
Its armor is preserved in minute detail in an undersea tomb.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the pitted plates of armor along its skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic, such preservation is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The closer you look at it, the more astounding it feels.
The bumpy plates of its skull armour still contain fossilised leather.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes up.
I can count the scales on its sole, too.'
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on August 9, 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment, scrolling through Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a note from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old youth. His body is still in the street."
Confused, she noted that no one else had posted the same information on her feed. That's why she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Her timeline featured numerous retweets from user @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a St. Louis-based rapper who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown. Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old Black man, had been shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body in the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away. When he returned to Twitter later that night, there were reports of people gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police cordons and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, with a sign carrying the words: "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed real-time video footage showing police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video of another officer cocking his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers stating.
"It was not the kind of murder we are already used to and could be said to be typical.
That's when I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 o'clock in the evening. Ferrell stopped by his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson within the next nearly three years has been made into a documentary, "Whose Streets?". It premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, and strength and resilience from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with her daughter, who was dressed in a floral dress and matching crown, they had a renewed conversation about "what it's like to live as a Black person and under what conditions." They had spoken about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how Black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We are going to Ferguson because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy and that is not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell later told me.
"Today's events are... the culmination of events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know that and to grow into it.
She needs to be equipped for activism and organizing, but she also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a Black person. And she needs to know what we need to do to be liberated, to liberate ourselves.
While I've been fortunate enough to be able to protect her from blatant racism, she's still just like every other Black girl.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality.'
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is opposite the police station. It became a campground for activists as they waited for information about the handling of the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the officer.
From there, Ferrell and her daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and handed them out to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism completely changed after Aug. 9," she tells me. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of an organization of minority nursing students. At the time, she focused on food justice and health disparities in Black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
Weeks later, Ferrell met at an evening rally with Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director.
Folayan said he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "simply wanted to tell" what was happening.
A suspicion crept into Ferrell's mind. He asked: "Do you really want to tell me what's happening, or do you want a story you can exploit?"
At the root of the suspicion were the countless times people, usually white, had turned up in the local community wanting only to profit from its hardships and resilience.
"We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a common voice," Folayan told me in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already reached out to assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with death row inmates.
Davis' involvement prompted Ferrell to join the effort, along with six other locals. A film crew followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, we speak," Davis says.
"The most important thing for me was how the local people are portrayed in the film because I'm portrayed in the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences because of the desire to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader but about the community." Ferrell, however, proved to be the most open of those described.
That's why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as he recounts what it felt like to see the film for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the human portrayal of Black people requires a certain vulnerability."
Additionally, Ferrell's story recaps and re-introduces the role of Black queer women into the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement emerged on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the shooting of Black teenage boy Trayvon Martin by police in 2012. Two of the movement's three founders identify as queer.
"The leadership of Black queer women has sustained the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we keep having to fight on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to put up with it all.'
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed sustained by Black women, with many queer women among them."
But he stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary "on his own" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy going," Folayan says.
"However, it's no coincidence that she was on the frontline. Black queer women are living at the intersection of a lot of things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
News crews have long since left Ferguson, but relations between the community and police remain strained.
Ferrell still has two-and-a-half years of probation remaining. He was convicted of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
His description of the sociopolitical climate in his home neighborhood is short and succinct: "A shambles."
Yet he still relies on a slogan he learned by heart on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our shackles."
Fitting resemblance: artist creates portraits from Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York has hung faces in the middle of the exhibition space – white, black and brown faces, between which, on closer inspection, you can see a resemblance.
These 30 works are portraits made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent the samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he was serving his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on 2 August 2017.
Underpinning it is two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in her work. Manning is a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third last day of her tenure.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, if somewhat theoretical, statement of the malleability, ambiguity and cause-and-effect relationships behind the interpretations, as well as identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly said she has identified with women since puberty. She was found guilty in 2013 of 20 offences, including a breach of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one image of Manning, who was sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie of an ailing Manning sitting in the driver's seat in the car. He's wearing the platinum-blond wig that became his signature.
Dewey-Hagborg was behind the hugely successful Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He obtained DNA data from items such as cigarette butts and chewing gum and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their case," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference for the new show.
Unable to visit Manning and unable to be photographed in prison, the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became pen pals, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even made a Suppressed Images comic book together, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and she would get to see the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published. It was a lucky coincidence after seven rough years in a Kansas military prison.
It's also impressive that the exhibit is opening right now as Donald Trump is waging his own war against leakers and transgender soldiers and coming up with ever-new ways on Twitter to reinforce the powerful divides he was supposed to actually mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
On the gallery wall is an artist's statement and underneath is Manning's large autograph, with the last name i's dotted on the heart. In the statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been based."
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of letters C, G and A written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist uses a scientific definition – Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in terms of our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features her Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories. There are 30 of them on display here."
The last work in the exhibition is in its own room: a page from a comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can silence you, they've won," the photo reads.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," the Philadelphia-based artist says.
"It's so impressive, I still get chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has yet to see the exhibit. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic information like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibit space.
It's intentional, as is everything else in this exhibition: Manning's DNA sequence, for example, is written in pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a sense of a crowd to them," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement Chelsea generated, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought as murder suspects
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show arrest warrants were issued Monday for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, who are suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of release on bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.
According to a local release issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Officers alerted to the Grand Plaza condo building found the victim with multiple slash wounds to his body.
Authorities said Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as murder. Police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
In an emailed statement, Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president for public relations, noted that Lathem is now on administrative leave and barred from Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal matter that authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is assisting in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial management assistant at the University of Oxford.
An emailed statement from a spokesperson for the university and Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with police in the UK and stand ready to assist authorities investigating the incident in the US in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said, Warren's colleagues are distraught and hope she will turn herself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, chief information officer for the Chicago Police Department, said he is seriously urging the suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and we are constantly refining our searches," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for the suspects.
He said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in Apartment 1008.
Police described the sight at the scene as horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team issued the following statement to residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic abuse."
Man threatened to blow up Islamic bookshop and 'kill Muslims' in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convict told police.
Moffatt must complete 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookshop in London and "kill all Muslims."
The Independent said David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, aggravated harassment.
Police said staff at the bookstore alerted them to the incident on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threatened to blow up a bookshop and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after making threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called police about the threat.
The threats had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities noticed that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore incidents, a police spokesman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police officers during questioning.
As punishment, the man must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay legal fees of £620, or about €690, and compensation of £85, or about €95, to the victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesman said a number of hate crimes were being left unreported.
"We will conclude the actions according to the WADA road map in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said Russia will soon complete steps under the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission (RUSADA).
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in collaboration with the UK Anti-Doping Commission (UKAD).
WADA's road map has been updated in these respects," Mutko stated on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA's road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was recently posted on the organisation's website.
He said there was nothing of concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the findings of an investigation ordered by WADA, into Canadian jurist Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state's alleged role in doping in Russian sport.
To that, Mutko said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs and we can't admit what didn't exist.'
Mutko's words had echoes of a statement by Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of Russia's independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian sports media RSport earlier that day, Smirnov acknowledged that there have been problems with Russia's anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and provisions in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added, however.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping controls in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal was revealed.
But it was given the go-ahead last June to plan and co-ordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
Olivier Niggli, the head of WADA, visited RUSADA's headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he noted that the organisation was "on the right track" towards regaining powers.
UK body skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: Health benefits of maternity packages 'lack evidence'
The British organization doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The Lullaby Trust, which fights SIDS, says it will ban the use of its own leaflets on maternity kits distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is distributed in some areas.
The Lullaby Trust says there is no evidence that maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
SIDS marks the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert in safe sleep for children.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them, as this would imply that we are recommending this product," the association said in a statement.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, the good reading in Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
The fact that every family there is given a box might be one factor.
But you can't say that for sure," Lullaby Trust chief executive Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity packaging is being marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and cot deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The kit contains a variety of accessories, including children's clothing.
This year, there are 53 products in the pack.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
The Scottish Government says the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, meanwhile, says there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no crib or cot available.
The organization recommends using the kit only for naps and to stop using it when the child is able to turn.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and making sure it doesn't get wet or dirty.
Fast-moving villain escapes from Japanese zoo for second time
Staff at a Japanese zoo search for an escaped tortoise.
The giant tortoise has surprised staff with its speed and escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama in western Japan on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It's not going to die right away because it's eating the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, told me.
The escaped 35-year-old villain is female, 55 pounds and about 3 feet tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to roam freely in the farm area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of the turtle.
The villain's last escape happened the other week.
Yamane found the fugitive walking along a road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help your business avoid Uber’s mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, unhelpful or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the surveys are anonymous, some employees viewed them with suspicion.
"The questions were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett tells me. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on e-commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups has increasingly entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and populations, as well as provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct access past senior executives to the board.
"You can monitor your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the corporate Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years. He says he has gained an even deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program allows you to quickly poll and vote for specific teams. It also allows you to create a map that shows at a glance which departments have the most dissatisfied employees and which managers have received the lowest ratings. This has allowed Errett to drill down to the root of the problems.
Companies have realised they need to follow workplace culture so they don't become the next Uber. There has been turmoil around the transport company ever since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry whose value could reach more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, based in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company surged earlier this year when Uber's reputation took a battering.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed a deal with Uber.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to conduct customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to suspect a manager of improprieties, complaints go directly to the company's board of directors.
"Public opinion has sidelined the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and chief executive.
He reminds that if a company mistreats its employees or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting a company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to make sure employees are aware of policies and procedures and can easily connect to headquarters.
Previously, the policy was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out a phone number or email address to file a report with head office. Then they had to file a formal complaint and hope it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel. He said complaints made by employees were hard to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from managers working in another city or state. Now, problems like discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of an employee's reality," says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we will protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
Quinlan said companies were becoming more serious about ethics, values and employee engagement after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed in the wake of unethical activity in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realised they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly cleared.
"Hope was used as a strategy, before technology came into ethics enforcement," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
It's a business model and opportunity that's accepted by venture capitalists. Both Glint and Convercent have the backing of venture capitalists.
Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February. It has raised capital totaling $47 million.
Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
The investments are no surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good salaries, and interesting projects, are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to a company's success if they are comfortable in the company and feel that they are listened to and that their work is rewarding," said Nina McQueen, LinkedIn president for employee compensation and well-being.
Investors get returns when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder they're of interest to investors.
Workplace culture experts say information about employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be willing to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, director general of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, which has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company doesn't take action, employees will start to wonder if they were consulted
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?'
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts monthly staff surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve staff retention over the long term in an industry known for high employee turnover.
"If a company doesn't commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it loses customers as well.
Without customers, there are no businesses.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly photographing his naked female neighbour, according to news agency TT.
The woman, who lives in Gothenburg, had come away from the shower at home after she noticed a mobile hanging on the end of a string outside her window.
The woman said the cell phone camera was filming into the apartment.
The woman who was startled by the incident had run to another room to get dressed.
When the woman had arrived to check on the situation, the cellphone had been pulled up first but lowered into the window again soon after.
A 20-year-old man arrested on suspicion of filming undercover has admitted filming the woman.
But he claimed he was only filming her face.
The video, shot on a cell phone, had been deleted and police had failed to return it as evidence.
Under questioning, the man has admitted the act but denied committing the offence.
The man said he loved his neighbor “crazy.”
The TT news agency said the man would be charged over the incident.
Teachers urged to pay more in fall talks
Wage growth cannot be lower than in the export industry, for example, but the gap should be narrowed, Olli Luukkainen, president of OAJ, said on Thursday.
A temporary cut in public sector furlough payments highlights the difference, he points out.
We are not in a position to enter into agreements where the review does not in some way include the furlough money cuts that have been made.
Agreements in the local government sector are likely to emerge only after private sector papers are signed and the increase rates are clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions will have been agreed in January.
The percentage target has not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of the public sector negotiation organisation Yuko.
Lukukkainen: Holiday allowance cut increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is weakening, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is growing.
According to Luukkainen, the fixed-term holiday allowance cut will further widen the earnings development gap.
In Finland, the number of students per teacher should be defined.
The OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the lowest performers are growing all the time.
The organisation says learning outcomes are deteriorating, with disparities between pupils and regions continuing to widen.
Bruins players' day lengthened as NCAA reduced daily workouts from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening. A group of UCLA American football players have been left chatting on the other side of the campus's new practice fields.
Some have taken off their jerseys, their backs shiny with sweat after the drudgery of the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this is a mid-afternoon conversation.
After three hours of practice, players studying at the university's summer courses return to the dormitory to read for final exams. The next morning, they gather at 6:30 a.m. at the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday changed to Tuesday.
The college sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one. The change was intended to lighten the players' workload, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That's why UCLA's first three practices started at a quarter past 7 p.m. It was hard to find room in the players" already full schedules.
Restricting training sessions to one a day means there are more training days than before. Camp began almost a week earlier this year than last, and this is the first time in Mora's six-season tenure as Westwood's coach that workouts are held to coincide with summer courses.
There are scheduled to be 18 practices before Aug. 20, when actual preparation for the season opener begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made players' schedules even tighter.
"We really load them up for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work. They are great guys.
I think it's going to get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes practices to outsiders after camp. That's not easy, given the direct view from the practice fields to the parking lot next door and the Luskin Center, a classy hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flown over the protective net behind the goalposts.
Bruins players are scheduled to move into the hotel this coming weekend, but Mora admits problems could arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements in place," Mora tells me.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film rehearsals from there on video. It's not an exaggerated concern.
You pay quite a lot for a video of the rehearsals.
But we have guards there and in the car park.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in central African Rwanda on Friday, with the winner already considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has contributed to running the country since 1994.
That's when the rebel group RPF put an end to the genocide orchestrated by the extremist Hutu.
Kagame was an RPF commander.
Kagame has been criticized for, among other things, crushing the opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because the constitution that limited the presidency to two terms was amended.
But in Rwanda, Kagame is also a genuinely well-liked leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have taken place and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask whether liberal multiparty democracy is the right model for African states.
But Kagame, too, has promised his people more freedom after the country is brought to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact-checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to independent fact-checkers with increasing frequency, as well as presenting the results under the original article. The world's largest social network announced the move on Thursday.
The company posted a statement on its website saying it will begin using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest purveyors of fake news. Many people think that fake news influenced the outcome of the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
The topic has come up in political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of a presidential election in May and Germany, which is preparing for elections in September, is backing a plan to fine social media networks if they do not promptly remove hateful content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement posted in Germany that fact-checking was being trialled in the US, France, Holland and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass the independent inspectors' sieve. They also want more background information so they can decide more enlightenedly what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook's News Feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook is continuing to test the Related Articles function and is making other changes to its News Feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The tiny Scotney Castle in County Kent is now known for Squeeze's music video as well as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
But it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now, this castle, in a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, is the subject of a comic book by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer with a penchant for old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by someone who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says longingly.
"I feel a personal connection as I hold the letter in my hand."
Rhodes's book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families who lived in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by documents from Britain's National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint on the letter. The letter had been written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 18th century," says Rhodes.
"It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he or she is on the spot himself or herself.
I love the archives!"
The author, attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits he couldn't wait to stay in the castle a little longer than would have been hoped.
He spent days researching the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles in a moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and chatted with rangers, gardeners and sometimes artists illustrating the book.
In the evenings, he "took whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's closer history is fairly unknown, as the castle was not passed entirely to the National Trust until the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about a dozen years later, the foundation's staff was just beginning to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years using the same method: taking any excess to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the days of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. "You'd imagine land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, though, families even fought over one birch.
I thought we should let it be.”
Some of the stories in the book progress from the castle to English history, such as The Labourer. It's about a man who joins shortly after the castle's completion in England's Peasants' Revolt in 1381.
"The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex book mentions that there was a riot at the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
"The English peasant rebellion began in the same area, and it occurred to me that rebellion can start with a riot.
Maybe these events are connected?”
Other stories in the book are closely linked to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, the story of a priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite the chap. They kept getting into debt and buying things they couldn't have afford.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old ladies, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court heiresses."
Now Rhodes is seeking new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life Hill, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, of which only a lush plot remains.
Scotney Castle holds a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave there," he tells me.
"I didn't want to go back to this damn thing."
Russia's worst relations since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukraine conflict.
I think you can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped to pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the Eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
Stoltenberg said NATO was still committed to keeping tensions from escalating.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia to avoid an escalation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg’s remarks, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump has thanked Congress for its poor relations with Russia, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko calls it quits - rematch against Anthony Joshua fails to materialise
Vladimir Klitschko, the longtime professional heavyweight champion, is ending his career.
Klitschko, 41, of Ukraine, announced his decision Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 times as a professional, winning 64 of them.
He held various World Cup titles between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
He was beaten by Tyson Fury on points in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and, after a ferocious fight, lost by knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
But Klitschko couldn't find motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to distance myself sufficiently for the Wembley game," Klitschko said in a statement.
I achieved everything I dreamed of as an amateur and professional boxer, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
Watch Klitschko's reasoning for his decision in the video.
Bernd Bönte, Klitschko's manager, said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
This is absolutely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been in a relationship with American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, daughter Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitschko's older brother Vitali is also a former world heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of the different federations at the same time.
Finnish weather pulveriser bewitches conditions: 'Takes the vibe'
The pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Nick had a problem with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken a woman’s breath away.
Even the World Cup in London has unsettled conditions.
Nick talks about the weather.
The conditions have been perfect this summer against the pole vaulter Minna Nikka.
I hate to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get the little stakes to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and trained here for God knows how many times and I have never experienced such a changeable wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump when the training has also had such unsteady winds, Nikkanen noted at the Kaleva races.
The weather in London on Thursday.
It's been quite a challenge to get the technology together - whether it's a cold jam or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the vibe away.
There's no point in expending energy in a bad environment.
He made it to the World Cup thanks to his hall jump of 455.
We've gone 445 outside.
The conditions are not the same for everyone in London.
You've got to be composure and wait for better winds.
The goal is to surpass 460 in Friday's qualifier.
Why don’t you go training abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I was able to get the jump together and standardize the technique.
I probably should have done the same now.
Normally you have been able to go to the hall to train, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
It's 25 degrees.
A little wind will do, as long as it's standard.
An ex-officer said: “We have no room for division now and for many years to come.”
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä’s Government must keep its hat on and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there is no room for division.
Yle interviewed Virta, who retired in 2015, on Wednesday morning.
Construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Politicians’ proposals on raising the guarantee pension, calculating car tax and supporting e-bikes, among other things, have recently popped up.
They mainly indicate that the elections are getting close, because with ten per cent of the state budget funded by additional debt, we have no room for division now or for many years.
I even think it’s a betrayal to talk about a pay-as-you-go when you take on debt,” Virtanen told Yle.
He pointed out that all debt is owed to the children.
Mr. Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started at the Treasury Department in 1978 as budget secretary and then worked as deputy chief of the budget department and budget manager.
Most recently, before retiring, he served as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the 3% economic growth now forecast is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike that will start to take a downward turn next year, and Finland faces growth of 1 per cent for decades.
Washington changes permanent residency rules
According to media reports, President Donald Trump announced that the permanent residence permit, or Green Card, rules will be changed with a new immigration plan.
The plan is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighten requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The draft legislation is to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayer money by changing the way permanent residency permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain immigration and replace the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who speak English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said.
Denmark's queen consort doesn't want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margareeta of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, will not be buried side by side, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, monarchs in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not wish to be buried at Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It's no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, head of communications at the court, commented in the paper.
For the Prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the Queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as an equal to his consort.
The court said the Queen has long been aware of the wish for her mate's burial site and understands the decision.
Terrifying moment on the road: Car nearly came on on motorway
Tommi had a live-in partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident happened at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo of the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi from Vantaa says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law husband Riina and the couple’s two young children drove along the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the Ring III exit to Hämeenlinnanväylä, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which nearly drove into the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without it, the car would have crashed into Tom’s car.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car hit a railing at high speed.
The parents and two young children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under three years old, the other is under one year old.
Obviously it was pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one drove by, even though there was heavy traffic.
The accident happened about 5:20 p.m.
Tommi said no one stopped at them, and the family called emergency services.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and emergency services personnel attended, and the family's condition was checked.
The car went into redemption.
Tommi says he and his common-law spouse have a low income, and they received a family allowance to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, Tommi says, the family will not receive the money from the insurance.
That's why the family is hoping for witnesses to the sighting of the car that caused the family to drive into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take the children to kindergarten and work without it, says Tommi.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thinks the beginning of the car's license plate number was SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're going to do financially, we're going to have to count every cent today as well.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen what happened or know anything about it are in contact with the police.
It is confirmed from the East Uusimaa Police Department and Central Uusimaa Rescue Department that they have had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
The headline and story were corrected at 9.15pm: Contrary to what was originally told, the second car did not enter the oncoming lanes, according to Tommi, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with relationships through humour - The Self-Exposed One will be seen at the Which? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first director to the Which? theatre.
The Self-Exposed is a musical theatre show about relationships gone wrong and inadequacy.
According to the director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is dealt with through humor.
There are no hard feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the touring summer theatre performance has been realised with a small budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the show challenges you to consider what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Is he pulling on one role or approaching the other with his jacket undone?
A plotless performance mixes fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He's also in charge of the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that while the performance draws on the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that Self-Exposure does not directly describe his or her own or the team’s relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own set of values will be conveyed by the show.
I don’t think relationships are bad, but I don’t think relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Exposure artist draws a topical picture of young adults living in a hundred-year-old Finland.
She said many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom are divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance features Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is arranged by Jäppinen and Rokka.
Love of theatre ignited in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to become a director of theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences.
Two years later and another one ahead.
His enthusiasm for theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
Raised by music classes, she has worked as an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and acted at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
There is an increasing interest in directing.
The self-revealer premiered last week in Helsinki on the Fool's Stage.
The performance, which lasts about 45 minutes, should also be seen in the future, at least in Jäppinen’s study town of Turku.
Exhibitionist at the Which? theatre in Kouvola on 4.8. at 7 pm and on 5.8. at 2 pm and 7 pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovers from gruesome motocross accident after breaking neck
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of moundbills toured the world for hundreds of days a year for some 20 years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but Lahtela’s movement continued.
He was not only a tireless intern, but also an experimenter in new species.
There aren’t many sports on earth that a chemist hasn’t tried at least once.
It's inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one of my hobbies was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical spine and both arms were broken.
I wasn't working anywhere.
I spent a year licking wounds in my home, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a part in the crash.
Riding a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't push for boundaries.
It's just that it's so hard that a 40-year-old like you shouldn't do too much!
After the accident, Lahtela found herself in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long scab behind him as head coach of Japan's freestyle national team.
Lahtela started in the job immediately after his career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela tells me.
Even during his coaching days, Lahtila often challenged his protégés on the slope and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that even my own thoughts didn't seem to make sense.
Not even among the species.
It was good to be still.
I actually enjoyed it because I really just got to be for once.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he fears he would have burned out.
It's easier to find places that are broken than intact!
If it wasn't for the accident, I wouldn't have realised I needed to rest so much.
Lahtela started as the coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of speed sports.
I switched motocross to disc golf!
It went right off the bat.
At my worst, I was throwing for seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-inspiring trainer herself, she does not insist that her coaches are the same as her.
I'm not forcing everyone into the same mold.
There is room in our culture to be unique and become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with that,” Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we need to worry
It’s here: a report on the evolution of technology in the sex robot industry – just when it was starting to feel like 2017 can’t get any weirder.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
"We need to start getting serious about the proliferation of sex robots," said Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of fingernails.
"There's sniggering at sex robots, but they're already being sold quite a lot, and we're going to see even more of them," Sharkey said at the report's unveiling.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with silicone skin that feels warm as well as AI-generated features that remind you of human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, ranging from the color of their eyes to the shape of their nipples and the type and color of their fingernails.
It's all the more worrying that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the character traits of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, say, shy.
True Companion's Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality aligns as fully as possible with the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in the mood or “in the mood”.
The proliferation of sex robots has many worrying features. They replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies when a user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resisting, for example.
On its website, True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator:
"Women have vibrators. Why shouldn't men have a sex robot?"
But sex robots aren't just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their proliferation and development is indicative of something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, the majority of men don't acquire a sex robot, and their popularity remains marginal, although the FRR report did report their growing popularity.
But marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of the times.
And a lot of people only start acting strangely or offensively when the market gives them permission to do so.
It's no coincidence that sex robots have begun to proliferate at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and a president is sitting in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
What's most unsettling about the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Handmaid) is not its powerful imagery, for example images of hanging bodies and gouged-out eyes. What's most disturbing is how realistic the world of the show feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems a surprisingly short distance away.
Attempts are being made to make sex robots as much like real women (with porn star proportions) as is technically possible.
Robot developers want their skin to feel authentic and their movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
But their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or the situation.
They have no will or history of their own – nothing to suggest independence or to violate the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terror plots were planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The head of the extremist group ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take a bomb aboard an Etihad Airways airliner.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of the Islamic State group had also sent bomb components to Sydney.
It is suspected the bomb was due to be taken on to a plane on 15 July, but the attempt was aborted before security checks were carried out.
Police would not elaborate on why the attempt was interrupted.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colourless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as public transport.
Australian Federal Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist scheme was one of the most professional schemes ever undertaken in Australia.
Suspected terrorist plots led to four men being taken into custody in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but questioning of him is also continuing.
Pros of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a paragon of common sense
During the Trump era, it has already been repeated to the point of saturation that the strong dichotomy among voters has also broken up families at the everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, advice columns in American newspapers were used to guide how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to reunite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me in New York this week, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been at loggerheads with our family Republicans.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin’s acquaintances – including the pro-Republican sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, but more broadly, it comes with significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we are talking about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to be horrified by his antics.
In the long run, there is an even more dire possibility that Trump will normalize right-wing Republicans who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I look back wistfully on Mitt Romney's low-key version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem like very mild transgressions.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential nominee need only be lucid, and that immediately feels like a marked improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park Carousel, the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best thing you can get in New York City for $3 without caffeine.
The horses on the merry-go-round are huge, the figures in the middle – grotesque clowns and animals looking back in terror – are ominous, and the bawling music in the background is strangely enthralling.
Many of New York's signature precincts grow disillusioned over time: the views of tall buildings begin to tire, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar and the city's reality doesn't match the dreams.
And I still, after 35 years, haven't quite got over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't a Swiss cottage after all but a big roundabout in north London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage, admittedly, is a Swiss-inspired pub, but that doesn't count.
The Central Park Carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience – so much so that two two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the merry-go-round a perfect score if anyone had asked for my review, but thankfully no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked at a department store this week to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars, before putting my credit card into a reader.
It's the same in a coffee shop in my neighborhood, but there I'm also given the opportunity to combine an estimate with a 15 percent service allowance when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service representative to put their personality on the line in a situation where it is not needed.
The saleswoman of the department store smiled with regret when I gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi sacked by Inter after 'lacking management confidence'
FC Inter have today relieved Shefki Kuqi of his duties as coach of the club's representative team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, previously an assistant coach, will take over the coaching responsibilities.
The rest of the coaching staff will continue in their current roles.
Piccareta, an Italian, has been an assistant coach in the past at English club Sunderland, among others.
Piccareta, 51, who joined Inter's coaching staff in January, has completed a UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, is sorry for the incident.
Changing coaches is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the confidence of the club's management, so there was now no other option," Håkans commented in a club statement.
Piccareta's contract is up until the end of the season.
He, along with the rest of the coaching staff, will be in charge as early as tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to reports, the team is in turmoil on Thursday.
Kuqi told players on Thursday morning that club assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been relegated.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed strongly in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin master Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hashtags have been added to the image, which can be used to determine that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
The young woman looks seriously at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he signals.
If you don’t see the picture, you can see it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
Just over a year ago, she posted a pair of pictures of herself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as a mother of two.
In her caption, Lampenius reflects on her own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders she suffered from when she was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is I've learned to like myself and how I look," Lampenius wrote.
After the text, she had added the English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders in previous years.
By the time she was 14 she was in hospital with anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also contracted bulimia, which was not finally discovered until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered from prison to hospital with chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cuts on his wrists, which prison officials say he suffered when he fell in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing several shots through a toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the lavatory.
Prosecutors have said they plan to appeal again as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence to be too lenient.
The Prosecutor General plans to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, with an appeal possibly to be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians who were camping illegally were arrested in Greece, the foreign ministry announced, according to bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1. Two Bulgarians were among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Foreign Ministry later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already issuing substantial fines to anyone camping outside designated areas.
The inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The ministry indicated that the court might impose a fine.
Liquidity sinks - already sinking -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's stock has sunk 7.7 percent at about 11 a.m.

Stock market trading has started today with a slight frosty start both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock market opened, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had slumped 0.2 percent.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki Stock Exchange's general index OMXH had fallen 0.3 per cent to 9509.48 points and the OMXH25 of the most traded companies had slumped 0.3 per cent.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was EUR 41 million, of which EUR nine million was Neste, the morning's result publisher.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like digestive system nightmares.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable condition that affects around 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes stomach cramps, bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Irritable bowel syndrome sufferers are generally advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen gut tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, the head of the study, immune cells guard the marsh and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, the result can be irritable bowel syndrome.
Tests found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with a specific bacteria in their guts.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan for immune cells to start showing up. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote resilience. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome," explains Professor Colonna.
"The more tryptophan in the diet of mice, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen gut tolerance and reduce inflammatory sensitivity.
Studying immune cells that strengthen resilience, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that while one group of mice had such cells, they were not present in mice of the same mouse species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gut microbiomes of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.
When the gut DNA of the mice was examined, six species of bacteria were detected in those mice that had immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were given to mice that grew in a sterile environment and had no gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to show up with immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without the bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen resilience.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of cells that could strengthen tolerance rose by about 50 percent. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half from earlier.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan, Lactobacillus reuteri, cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as they do in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High levels of tryptophan combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their proliferation".
Jose Mourinho feels Manchester United got 'genius' in their ranks after signing Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United were given a "genius" in their ranks after signing Nemanja Matic. The midfielder will debut for Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Matic, who transferred from Chelsea for £40m, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup tournament match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic, however, was not yet in the best shape because he was not on the pre-season tour of Asia with the Blue Shirts. He managed only 45 minutes on the pitch – something Mourinho says needs to change before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius – he has a natural football thinking ability," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
As well as Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting a game at the Aviva stadium as Mourinho began to file through his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club have already done a "great job" by acquiring three of the four players he has prioritised.
"Three out of four – you have to give the club credit for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualifying tournament to Germany in straight sets 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's routine level of play is high.
Their game was consistent in every sector," Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept their opponents tight, but in the third round Germany were clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to play along,” Kangasniemi said.
The most effective in Finland was Piia Korhonen, who scored 14 points.
Finland, which has lost three games out of four, will still face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury already sent subpoenas in connection with Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting
A grand jury in the United States has sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by special counsel Robert Mueller has already sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, who is known for her Kremlin connections.
That's according to the Reuters news agency, which at the same time confirms information revealed by the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday about the grand jury convening.
According to Reuters, a grand jury has sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, who is known for her Kremlin ties, that took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Paul Manafort, then campaign manager for Donald Trump Sr., as well as his son-in-law, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington marks an escalation in the pace of the Russia investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted the grand jury's help in an investigation that seeks to determine Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or those close to him cooperated with Russia in the matter.
The grand jury is expanding Mueller's rights to gather evidence, send subpoenas and compel people to testify under oath.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
A grand jury is weighing the evidence the prosecution has unraveled in its investigation and will decide whether charges should be filed in the case.
British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a flick of his hand
A British inventor has become the first in the country to microchipped himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a flick of his hand.
The microchip is sandwiched between 33-year-old Steven Northam's thumb and index finger. Now he offers the service to businesses and individuals looking to make their lives easier with technology from Northam's company BioTeq.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses technology similar to that used in cat and dog microchips, and takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company will also convert the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with a microchip. It costs £300 to process one of the locks.
Northam is married, with one child. He has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which kicks in when he puts his hand down on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a Navy helicopter to the White House's South Lawn for an event featuring American production came at a cost to taxpayers of $24,000. The information appears in military documents obtained by TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the president is aboard. It was the attraction at an event at the White House on July 17, 2017, to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a number of White House officials took a look at the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the Connecticut-made helicopter, exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter on a mission-specific order only about 36 hours before it landed in the southern grass field for the "extraordinary" event. This is clear from documents from the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter fleet.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of the issue because this is an extraordinary event that is getting a lot of coverage," the commander of the HMX-1 unit wrote in an e-mail message to his supervisor, who is an assistant commandant in the Navy's Joint Chiefs of Staff, the day before the incident.
The message said the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field around 7 a.m. on July 17 and the event would begin at 3 in the afternoon. The helicopter would only leave the scene after the grass field was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. in the evening.
The note also mentioned that if the helicopter's departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew would be needed because of restrictions on service hours.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the duration of the incident, and security personnel from the unit were by the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents obtained by TIME whether another crew was ultimately needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the event violates the law.
"One of our questions was whether there was a violation of the Hatch Act here. We were told there would be no violation," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commandant replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke in favor of health care reform, which was under consideration in the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must wear them on their travels,
but their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the backdrop of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor's use of the presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which showcased products made from American materials by American workers from all 50 states," stated White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
Crews from the HMX-1 unit regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice on the southern grass field to bring the president to the White House with centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
One official said the flights to Made in America were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters that day also flew 11 hours in "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said the event did not incur any other costs for taxpayers.
A spokeswoman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in organizing the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no accounting for flights related to presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the event's expenses.
According to the Department of Defense's 2017 hourly allowances, the replacement level for a VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from the Quantico base in Virginia state to and from the White House took a total of one hour.
The White House says the cost of operating the helicopter will be markedly lower.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated compensation level includes staffing, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are factored into the annual allocation."
According to a 2015 study by research firm RAND, compensation levels do not include staff costs but do take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Around the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer excused the use of a helicopter at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and employing probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that a lot of Americans have worked hard for.
It's perfectly appropriate to bring that up.'
It's not certain if Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat down in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Salama hit the Vaasa track - trains will have to be replaced by buses
Passenger train services between Seinäjoki and Vaasa have been discontinued due to a technical fault, the Rail Traffic Centre announces.

A fault in the traffic control system was caused by a thunderstorm.
As of mid-morning, there was no estimate of the duration of the repair.
Venezuela's state prosecutor urges court to block appointment of country's new assembly
Venezuela's state prosecutor has sought a court ruling that would block the appointment of the country's new representative body.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the elected assembly in last Sunday's vote is to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative council was elected for the country, which can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
Chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the blocking decision had been requested because of suspicions of election fraud.
Ortega has also launched an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the position after the British company that organised the representative vote said the results had been manipulated.
The company said the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about 1 million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated, and Maduro's son and wife are included in the 545-member body.
In addition to changing the constitution, the council can dissolve the opposition-led congress and change laws.
Maduro described as dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees tweaking the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro, calling him a dictator.
For their part, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have said they will not recognize the new representative body.
Maduro insists the new body of representatives is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
Numerous people have been wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela descended into economic crisis after oil prices tumbled.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new assembly is due to start.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in U.S. prison
On Thursday, a Minneapolis court sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the U.S. demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been vacationing in Finland.
He was detained by Finnish border authorities as he was returning home.
Finland handed over the Senah to U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, according to the AFP news agency.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud for profiting by millions of dollars.
Senah received 46 months in prison.
The U.S. Justice Department says Senah will be deported from the country after serving a prison sentence.
Russia's Foreign Ministry issued a harsh rebuke of Finland after his arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement slammed Finland and the United States for making the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
Prosecutors said Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish out usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further redirect internet traffic to perform click-and-collect scams and spread spam.
Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Justice Department's criminal division, said the case shows the U.S. is also capable of pursuing cybercriminals operating in others.
We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 8:58 p.m.: Corrected the transcript of the condemned person's name.
'Narcos' Season 3 trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali cartel will take the lead in Netflix's hit series
While Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that there will be a third and fourth season of the show. A trailer for the third season has been announced, showcasing the new villains in the series.
In season three, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's richest drug trafficking organisation.
The organization, run by four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company," except that there is slightly more bribery and violence by authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brains. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles communications with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a comeback as Javier Peña, who recruits US and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos premieres on September 1.
Kari Kola creates exceptional light art in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will perform an exceptional light art piece to mark the first Day of Light in Paris next year on 16 May.
Kola is making a light artwork for Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe Monument in front of it.
I want to emphasize not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in cities of millions is a significant problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
My art allows me to make things that I feel are important visible in a concrete way, says light artist Kari Kola of his work.
I am very honoured to be part of the first International Day of Light and to bring light art as part of the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola took part in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO Headquarters to mark the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-implement my art at the UNESCO headquarters,” says Kari Kola.
The work may yet expand significantly.
We will announce this later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light to humanity and to increase people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men brawl in shopping centre car park in Espoo
Two men got into an argument in the Iso Omena shopping centre in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute was sparked when one of the parties accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
A driver driving in a prohibited direction swung at the driver of another car, causing his car to take off, crashing into the batter's car.
He then punched the hood of the car that had still crashed.
In a preliminary address, the man has admitted causing the damage and doing the wrong thing.
From a question mark headlined by Timo Soini: "After that came the deluge"
On Thursday, Foreign Minister Timo Soini published a blog post headlined with a question mark.
The article is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to a government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
There are references to 18th century France in the text of Soini.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour are known to have used the parable of the deluge.
Depending on the interpretation, the statements "the deluge after us" or "the deluge after me" have remained in the history books.
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
Elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the U.N. aid mission, noted that hundreds of women are running in provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if they involve women fully and involve them in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban have made threats about the election at the same time that international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election marks the first time that power is transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said women's contributions will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
Of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women, according to Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission.

An influx of certain types of tourists a threat to the region's culture
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local outrage is directed particularly at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
Italy's culture minister calls it "eat and flee" tourism: you're on target for just a few hours and rush through the sights in big numbers.
Venice is choked with tourists taking quick day trips to the city.
The narrow streets are difficult to navigate and the fine squares are so crowded with visitors that Venice's residents can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic centre while hotels have taken the place of homes.
The problems brought about by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you're given two or three hours.
Follow the flag-holding guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark’s Square and turn back, says Dario Franceschini, Italy’s Minister of Culture.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in the architecture, but also in the operation of the place, the shops and the workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the identity of cities.
St. Mark’s Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice’s historic centre.
St. Mark's Church is located on the edge of the square.
The anger of locals is also mostly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in Venice's historic centre.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
They say tourism has degraded their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving residents away.
About 2,000 residents leave every year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster," says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the vessels bring much-needed income to Venice and create a need for jobs in a wide range of sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is planned that cruisers will go further away from the historic centre.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, thinks the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Veneto, where Venice is also located, were given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.

Bad miles-long traffic jams on motorway
The northbound lane of the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi has been jammed for miles during the return traffic on Thursday afternoon.
The area is undergoing resurfacing work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For roadworks, there is a 50km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120km/h.
Even in the 50km restricted area, however, traffic had been moving at a virtually walking pace in some places by Thursday afternoon.
The road work proceeded on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi at the Apocalypse statue, or golden deer.
I get along just fine without that kind of attention
The 23-year-old runner has had to pick up on the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has posted stunning photos of herself in settings such as the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current native Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400m in March by lapping the track lap in 51.81.
A month later, he improved the Norwegian record for the 400m hurdles to 55.38.
Iuel, who uses social media assiduously, found out soon after his record that fame and publicity have a downside.
Men around the world began sending Iuel pictures of their genitals, apparently in the hope that the young runner would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of 'stubborn photos' from people I didn't know, so I was forced to change my account to private," Iuel told VG magazine.
In his interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of images he received.
You can probably guess, I laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I get on well without that kind of other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2.
When Amalie was 12, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, for her father's job.
After that, it was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a college athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, returning to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three trainers: Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, a coach has a lot more time to personally engage with an athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in the 400m and 400m hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korve's entire career on the line - now with the World Cup: "It's nice when nothing hurts"
It's been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has really enjoyed his beloved sport again this season.
As recently as last summer, career resumes were at stake.
An injury to the foot had forced Korve to the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to heal.
Even the hand had taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I had no idea what I was going to do, whether or not I would continue to board.
The sponsorship deals were on hold and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things have a way of working out.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw again to the slope.
The follow-up decision was easy after that.
I knew it the first time I was in the snow.
I was like, damn, yeah this is so much fun again, let's pull a couple more seasons.
Korpi didn’t get to count properly until September-October, but after a long break from counting, just working out pain-free has been a big deal.
There have only been a few races around Korpi.
I don't mind.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years in a single race, and then you're in for a fever that week.
I can’t think like that, the dog says.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Championships in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don't keep him from boarding, from racing in tough company, he always lights up.
According to Korve, the prestige of the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, even though some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is big.
In my opinion, though, appreciation always depends on what the conditions are and what the level of the games are.
Korpi is the oldest athlete on the 12-member Finnish team in Sierra Nevada.
Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, 17-year-olds, are 14 years younger than Korpe.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point too, everything was new and I was so sickly excited about everything.
It brings a new flow to you, Korpi thinks.
I can still keep up on the slope, but otherwise I don't, that's how much the guys have got going on!
Behind the rafting career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director legend Pekka Korve is addicted to race sports: the boarder has his own racehorses, for which he does the training programs.
When I travel all the time, there is no more time to be in the mess hall.
But I watch at least the race results every day and usually something like the departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, horse grooming and race coaching are a potential career plan when the board career comes to an end.
I don’t plan that far ahead, but at least it’s a viable option.
I feel like I'm studying it here, along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to keep up with the times and improve, I'm maybe driving some departures in the summer as well.
If it is my future career, then it is not difficult to start when you are already inside the sport.
The rave stuff also includes an Elitloppet ravi cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship heading to Stockholm for the Elitloppet race in late May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to resurrect the old tradition.
The cruise has been selling well, and people have been excited.
We are now at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months to go, let’s hope to fill the ship,” Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's care home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-bed care home for older people to be built at Kitee.
The 1,700-square-metre building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre’s neighbouring Terveystie road.
At Kitee, a common source of wonder is where the new care unit will have enough customers, as many private care homes suffer from a lack of customers during the Siun sote period.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, commented that Kitee will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better too, says Flink.
Attendo bought private care homes Kanervikkola and Eerikka from Kitee last year.
The deal was for business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on the properties.
Flink says there is no acute need for Attendo to move operations out of these facilities.
More on this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand Scottish factory
The trade union is seeking confirmation from executives at McVitie's biscuit maker of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB, the UK's general trade union, said the company had not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The plant, which makes Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, which owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives will "certainly be the first to be told" if there are any changes to operations.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns about the lack of funding allocated for the modernisation of production lines."
Drew Duffy, of the GMB trade union, finds it extremely worrying that the plant manager is not providing clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is highly concentrated in the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area. The factory is a major employer in an area of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, the rising cost of living and the continued curtailment of production, east Glasgow desperately needs a successful McVitie's."
A Pladis spokesman said the factory manager had only received the trade union letter the day before and the company is responding to the letter directly because it appreciates the ongoing interaction with workers and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
Among other things, we discussed with employees the fact that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we continuously evaluate all our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
A spokesman said the company had invested more than £5m in the Tollcross plant in recent years, most notably in its production lines and operational improvements.
"We are aware of Tollcross' long history as a manufacturing facility and will certainly be the first to let employees and union representatives know if we intend to make any changes to the plant's operations."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's transfer three years ago?
LaLiga may regret interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up pursuit of Neymar after paying a £189m transfer fee to close the deal. But did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked about incident of the summer. The team in France's Ligue 1 football league are poised to break the world record for transfer totals. The previous record was less than half as low: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in an £89m transfer.
Following the transfer, Neymar will become the world's most expensive footballer and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him a salary of more than £500,000 a week after tax.
Barcelona are known to be furious with PSG's performance and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source close to Barcelona says the club have taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived at Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG chairman warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs seeking PSG's best players.
"I am not worried, as they know that if they are after our players, we will become their opponent and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they're after our players, they're going to have to face the consequences.'
Barcelona appear guilty of doing just that: expressing an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear it would not let the Italian leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar as a result.
Neste held back the rise of the stock market - Stock exchange news - Ilta-Sanomat
Metsä Board, the day's other major earnings publicist, was left with a gentler decline.
The broad European general index Stoxx 600 was up 0.1 per cent at the close in Helsinki.
The Helsinki Stock Exchange's general index OMXH rose 0.1 percent to 9542.08 points.
The OMXH25 of the most traded companies advanced by the same amount.

NYT: Trump's glowering phone calls were made up - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two phone calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never took place, according to the New York Times.
Trump's incensed phone calls with both Mexico's president and the leader of the Boy Scouts of America have proved contrived.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed there had been no calls.
But he said Trump wasn't lying.
Sanders said many of the scouts' leading figures spoke to Trump personally, and that Trump had spoken with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, that's a pretty tough accusation to make.
Those conversations happened, they didn't just happen on the phone but face to face," Sanders argued.
Speech to scouts sparked outcry
On Monday, Trump said the Mexican president had called him and praised Trump's success in rooting out illegal migration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few people come across the southern border of Mexico because they know that the trip will stop at the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement Wednesday saying that no such call has taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico published a full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump enthused about his speech at a major meeting of the National Boy Scouts of America in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the Boy Scouts, he said it was the finest speech ever given to them.
“They were very grateful,” Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Boy Scouts of America said it was not aware of a call from any of its executives to Trump.
According to the statement, an earlier statement by Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organization, in which he had apologized to the Boy Scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for itself.
Trump’s speech at the Boy Scouts of America meeting caused a lot of puzzlement, as it was exceptionally political given the nature of the event.
Among other things, he raved about the results of last fall's presidential election.
