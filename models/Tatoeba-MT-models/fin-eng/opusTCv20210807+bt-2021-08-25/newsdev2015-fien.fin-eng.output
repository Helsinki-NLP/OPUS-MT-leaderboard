Changes to business support practices - Provincial - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will be concentrated in four ely centres as of mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the Etelä-Savo ely centre is responsible for the operations in Mikkeli.
Under the new Enterprise Aid Act, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU structural funds may no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is a whole new activity.
The subsidiaries of municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants are also classified as large municipalities.
On the other hand, EU support can continue to be granted for investments that improve the conditions of municipalities’ business life.
In Eastern Finland, the unit managing EU and national subsidies will have the strength of approximately 30 people.
At least for the time being, they will all continue to work in their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölönen, head of the Structural Funds Unit of the Etelä-Savo Ely Centre, has a job in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine
Russia is consistent, even if it doesn’t always look like it.
Head of the Department of Strategy at the National Defence College, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by Monday morning's conflicting Ukraine news.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine reports that its paratroopers are currently fighting with the Russian tank division near the Luhansk Airport, and that the tank division has received reinforcements (read more here).
Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire without conditions in the Minsk negotiations.
Russia denies being involved and must immediately achieve the outcome of the negotiations so that they can consolidate their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That’s the whole story, Siren says.
This is the big picture: quickly we need to start negotiating, and precisely so that Russia gets its own grip on the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair outsources cabin services to Norwegian company, layoffs people
Finnair begins to purchase cabin services by subcontracting to Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will first cover Finnair's Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but it is expected to be extended later.
Outsourcing of two routes leads to a total reduction of approximately 100 person-years in Finland, which will be implemented at the first stage with lay-offs, the company said in a statement.
In addition, the work of about 80 Asian temporary workers will end when the routes are outsourced.
Finnair announced in June that it plans to outsource cabin services on approximately 20 routes over the next two years.
Outsourcing ended when there was no agreement on savings with the personnel.
Outsourcing is expected to begin in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also be continued with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve-related back pain, i.e. sciatica, in those who do heavy shift work.
A study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to sciatica trees is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance condition of firefighters, which are regularly tested, do not seem to protect against pain, says the research director, Docent Sirpa Lusa, in a statement from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.
The work of firefighters is irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Are you familiar with the new causes of water damage?
It can easily cause damage to other homes.
Water damage is by no means always caused by a leaking pipe or faucet, says an expert at the hosting association.
We have been contacted when the breaking of the aquarium has caused water damage in the housing company that it is possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert at the hosting association.
Furuhedhjelm points out that not only pipes and sewers are a common cause of water damage, but now more and more new machines such as ice-burning machines have caused water leaks in homes.
Many people do not know that machines such as a washing machine or a washing machine should not be left unattended.
The tap must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the pipes can lead to a water leak.
The resident may be deemed to have committed negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case liability for damages lies with the resident.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the conditions of the insurance and the case.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused damage by negligence, the resident has liability.
If the resident has passed out in the shower over the floor well, the omission can often be proven, because in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the maintenance worker comes to the apartment, where the extinguished resident is found.
Furuhedhjelm says that due to the generalization of the overturning of floor wells, two floor wells have now been installed in shower rooms in many student apartments.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although not as much as before when they were more popular.
Even a dog’s cup of water and the fall of a home wine bowl can become a real water damage.
I also know of a case where there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage,” Furuhedhjelm says.
The principle of liability for repairs always goes the same way if the company’s Articles of Association do not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material, and the housing company for damage to the structure and damage to other dwellings.
Water damage easily causes damage to other apartments, because concrete in the structure absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuhjelm, radiator leaks in apartments are particularly difficult because the radiators easily leak insidiously into the structures.
Water damage can be caused by today’s widespread air heat pumps that produce condensate water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or rainwater network, not just a container.
The shareholder is also responsible for removing water, snow, ice and debris from the balcony, the legal expert advises.
Furuhjelm advises that even if the housing company’s rules do not require, for example, a fixed exhaust hose for a washing machine, there may be a condition in the insurance that means that compensation will not be received for this reason.
You should be careful with your home insurance policies.
However, I consider the dewatering pipes in the bathtub, for example, loose from washing machines to be a big risk, which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the drains should always be fixed in the sewer system.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Monitoring of washing machine, washing machine, etc., when they are on.
Closure of taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well is visible twice in half a year.
The recommendation is to connect the drainage water to the sewers firmly.
Check taps and their possible leaks
Regular freezer defrosting

FC Honka lost again and became a serial jumbo
At Tapiola Sports Park on Sunday night, the two weakest teams of the football Veikkausliiga fitness puntar at the moment met.
FC Honka, the last to celebrate a win in June, hosted the Vaasan Ball Club, which sailed in a winning streak of seven games.
The VPS just received its previous victory against Honka in July.
Sunday’s encounter with the Espoon team came to a good seam, as the VPS returned to the winning position from a long time, reading 2-1.
Before the game, Vaasan head coach Olli Huttunen complained about the inefficiencies of his team, but the confused Honka defense eased VPS scoring problems.
Very nervous execution.
We didn’t get any longer attacks at all, we couldn’t keep the ball — Huttunen assessed his own performance.
In the first half, Honga's top-up duo Milovic - Kosta Manev played very uncertainly.
Both goals were created as a result of the loose play of the tops.
The opening goal of the match was seen only after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed Walter Viitala, the Honka goalkeeper, who had missed Sebastian Strandvall's shot.
Sorry about the first half.
By the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game — Honga head coach Shefki Kuqi manasi.
After the initial shock, the Espoons got their games together and ran the ball on the offensive head.
In particular, midfielder Carlos Portela and winger Roni Porokara were eager to search for fake spots, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest to scoring was Honga midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot however was slightly past the VPS goal.
The VPS struck effectively using its wicket attackers and Honga's crazy top pair.
Within half an hour, the Vaasans scored a 2-0 hit when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through alone.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good game head during the opening season and repeatedly created situations from his left side.
Stewart's speed throughout the game seemed to be too much for the Espoon defence.
“I screamed at halftime that if we lose, then we lose with honor,” Kuqi said.
During the second period, Honka furiously sought a narrowing goal.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt was successful.
The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to level the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, which allowed the VPS to face dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were able to get a soot with Viitala once, but the horrendous rejections of the Honka goalkeeper kept the home team involved in the game.
At the end of the day, Honka got a little bit out of shape and couldn’t get any extra goals.
With the loss, Honka cast the Veikkausliiga last while there are still seven matches left in the series.
Putin Says He Could Take Kiev in Two Weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was rather harsh in a telephone conversation with the President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, according to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his indignation at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
\"If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks,\" La Repubblica said.
Putin’s message to Barroso was this: “It is not worth irritating Russia with new sanctions.”
Putin gave Russia's first television channel an interview on the crisis in Ukraine on Sunday night.
Putin said in an interview that he considered the conflict to be entirely internal to Ukraine and urged the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev strongly about the firing of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
\"Russia -- you can't stand by -- if people are shot at death at close range,\" Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The actor's work destroyed the family
A co-star and a theatre family grew up to acknowledge how the acting profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine turns 70 next Friday, but I think the saying is that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year ago or two years or ten years ago.
Mental puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but still works for many men.
It was sometimes joked that not many plays would be made in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roinee has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre play How to Succeed Easily in Business, the Tampere Workers’ Theatre’s Dememorator and the Quartet of Tampere Comedy Theatre.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Rapper movie.
Photo by Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career did not start promisingly.
I wasn't good enough for a roadboy picture at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said that I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the field that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army just to get to the theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has made about 200 theatrical roles and 300 TV shows a little, depending on how you calculate.
If you count things like Englishmen that every part of a TV show is their own show, then there are over 600 TV stories.
I was three years in a new day, three episodes a week.
Last year, I was killed when I didn’t have time to do it.
Commitment to Autumn 2016
Esko’s big sisters Eila, 83, and Alice, 76, are in full swing and make the Tampere Workers’ Theatre still has a chance to play wild roles as anarchist grandmothers.
The little brother will be on the stage for years to come.
Well, that's what it looks like, but you don't know about this age.
I always have to make a reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
The years have also left a mark on the man.
Age does not come alone.
The knees are operated, the hip whistles and the osteoarthritis troubles, but when you don’t let it too much disturb you, you’ll get rid of it,” says Esko Roine.
Roine became familiar to the TV audience, among other things.
From pirate radio and a quiz where Antti Einio and I shared hundreds, 100 markka notes.
It was Antti Einiö who shared the crops.
I was trying to keep telling you that they're hundreds, not crops.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was an overly important Lieutenant Iron Rock.
He became a favorite of the Tampere policemen, at the station when he happened to be working as a lieutenant of the same kind.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open, and shouted to me that the Iron Rock was brilliant.
The working group succeeded
The theatre works in Roine's mind have been e.g.
The Helsinki City Theatre Producer and Master Class, the death of the Tampere Workers’ Theatre’s Commercial Traveler and Tampere Theatre’s Long Day trip to the night.
It all comes down to the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not because of me, it's because of the team.
There are also rhymes.
Pekka Puupää’s role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the end result isn't me and the viewers are not satisfied.
As an actor, you can’t choose your own work.
It's just nice doing what you've been told to do.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 1980s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was an educational experience.
It didn’t work out at all when I tried to be the executive director, actor and then restaurant manager of Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year it became clear that they could not be reconciled.
What was typical was that when the show was coming to an end or in the middle of the day and I was wondering if I was going to put the sauna on, there was a phone call from the restaurant, that there are your friends here who are hoping to see you after the show.
Memories for a Birthday
On his birthday, memoirs from Esko Roine appear, ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've created some kind of lump from the memories of the face-wrestler.
You know, when I was in Zoom, they used to call me a face-wrestling.
I didn't know them by name.
The book has been made for years.
At one time, Roine told me that there is no newsbomb, because he hasn't done anything so flimsy, or if there is, he won't tell.
I made a small initial statement in the book.
I say that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There is a lot of work there, both as an actor and as a theatre director.
The publisher says there’s also a lot of excitement about theater school time.
It was a pretty normal student life, but when I was a kid, I did all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as wild as it was in Turka's time.
It was very different.
I don’t know how much I got from there except for the confidence that once the school has been done, I know that it won’t matter if the actions don’t get better.
I didn’t have to think how good I would have been if I had gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen and got to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Halttunen.
With Pia Hattara, we had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him at school.
Martti, the middle son of the fire, was in the same class with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttunen.
As a sad thing, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to the mother and the son to me.
I didn’t see it as a good solution, and I think the children are pretty much in agreement now as adults.
In theater circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In my case, I did a lot of work then.
I was in the theater on almost every case.
Then there was the TV and the radio.
I spent a long time and my family life suffered.
Maybe a free night on the holiday.
Esko Roine will be celebrating at the Tampere Workers’ Theatre on September 7.
The celebration will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
There's a mind-wracker there, too.
I was 50 and 60 at work.
When such an easy-to-move play took place, I thought that we should now have the 70s, so we can get them off with one beat.
According to Raine, there are no celebrations on the actual birthday.
I think it's a night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I might have booked a gig for that day.
Or maybe it’s a weird night off that I’m going to have on a night off,” Roine says.
Aviation companies concerned about the supply chain
Some smaller aircraft manufacturers in the UK are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may derail ambitious plans by large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing chain are currently enjoying an unexpectedly large number of aircraft and engine development plans being implemented at the same time.
Aviation and Defence
While some are enjoying the order sum, warnings have been given about the capacity problems and price pressure at hand in the supply chain.
“It is quite true that there is price pressure, especially now that production is challenging,” said Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, one of the major suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, which represents approximately 240 aircraft production suppliers in the north-west of England, more capacity is needed.
Do strategies and investment plans match these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production equipment and machinery needed to implement these production volumes,” Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the proliferation of aircraft construction are part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chrurchill, which produces the wings of gas turbines, the company is behind it - a challenging time - when several new construction plans began to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very low production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and we had to try to push forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans,” Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several operators in the sector believe that further investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if the UK wishes to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation industry after the United States.
Geoff Ford, chairman of Ford Aerospace and engineer at Tyneside, says that the order sum should increase producers’ confidence and willingness to expand and increase production capacity, as work will be sufficient.
“If this doesn’t happen, we’ll lose in competition with other countries,” Ford said.
A few major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, a company manufacturing aircraft and engine parts in the FTSE 250 index, purchased UPECA, a Malaysian aircraft parts manufacturer, for £75 million.
Last year, MB Aerospace acquired companies in North America and Poland.
“It’s possible to buy start-up companies that create new operations, but in reality the most slow down in production is the limited design and the number of engineers,” says Gallagher MB of Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has passed to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the operators in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of the GKN aircraft manufacturing unit, who is also a UK aircraft trade representative, is of the opinion that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
“More important than the volume is the introduction of new technology and advanced processes,” Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are now more cautious in order not to increase building volumes too quickly.
As Boeing attempted to increase its production in 1997, it faced great difficulties when the company made losses and factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of Rolls Royce's aircraft manufacturing unit, says the company has not yet encountered problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18,000 parts needed to manufacture the jet engine.
“The road will certainly be bumpy, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare to increase their operations,” Wood says.
According to Boeing CEO James McNerney, the company’s production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good sense of the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus’ passenger jet manufacturing unit, says the company will do everything it can to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 by 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
“Perhaps one of the suppliers will not succeed, and our job is to try to prevent this situation, as well as support journalists and look for alternatives, but have to wait for big problems,” Brégier said.
Bregiér says Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: “The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is my job and that's Airbus's.
Hong Kong protest groups launch — an era of civil disobedience — with Beijing banning open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Pro-democracy activists spread out on the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their demands for open elections.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups stress that demonstrations can flare up and swear to ensure that the city begins -- an era of civil disobedience -- in opposition to the reforms of the elections proposed by the Chinese government.
Thousands of protesters flogged the coming rain against Hong Kong's shimmering horizon as they wandered to a demonstration organized by the democracy-supporting Occupy Central group in front of the council's facilities for law enforcement on Sunday night. There, protesters urged people to take part in a large sitting demonstration to paralyze the city's financial quarter.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it was denying voters the right to publicly propose candidates in the 2017 mayor's election, thus defying months of protests that further increase the city's division.
Protesters take part in the start of the Occupy Central Movement protest in front of key government buildings in Hong Kong.
“We want fair and proper elections,” said Dion Tse, a 24-year-old website administrator who took part in a Sunday protest with her 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
The Chinese People's Congress approved plans for election changes, allowing only two to three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the nomination is subject to the approval of a nomination committee of 1200 people, and the opposition politicians believe that this effectively prevents the dissenting political views from being cast on the ballots.
Protesters take part in a demonstration organised in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
Police estimate that more than 2,600 people were currently participating in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed when around 100 protesters led by a Scholarism student group gathered late Sunday at Grand Hyatt, where Communist Party member Li Fein was scheduled to stay overnight in Beijing after his arrival.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he did not say the exact date of the road block, but urged the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation — over the next couple of weeks — adding that the city is officially moving — into the era of civil disobedience —
Benny Tai answers questions from the press.
“Look at the person next to you,” he said in a Sunday protest, standing in front of a billboard of two figures in China representing disobedience.
That person is taking over the center with you!
Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old rallyer representing Scholarism, said earlier that preparations for high school students' demonstrations are underway and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to protest by refusing to teach.
“In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility,” Wong said.
In Beijing, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the People's Congress Committee, told reporters that defending universal suffrage -- international demands -- is a waste of time -- and originates from some Hong Kong politicians who seek -- to confuse society and mislead it --
“Unpractical proposals such as the nomination of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time,” Li says, demanding that the electoral method should be created in such a way as to fit the real situation and legal framework of each society.
The bill on universal suffrage can only be passed as a law if a large majority, or two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-member legislature, supports it, which means that the 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong could be drawn into a protracted political debate if the reform proposal was rejected by veto.
“It would hinder business and the development of the city,” he said.
Almost 800,000 people voted in an informal poll organised by the Occupy Central Movement in June to resist China's demands, and the demands are that the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
As many as 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, at the same time as a march in favour of Beijing and against the Occupy Central movement on 17 August attracted about 88,000 participants, estimates of the figures coming from the University of Hong Kong, though estimates by police and organizers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured in lightning strike at New York beach
In a lightning strike at a beach in New York City, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on the Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx on Sunday night as heavy storms crossed the area.
The injured men are hospitalized.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when heavy thunderstorms swept over the city.
Storm rains, thunder and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebration and U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Dozens of commercial flights to the city's airports were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not to please
This is the latest guidance for network users for employees and managers, and is shared by the author of Monday Morning Manager, Harvey Schachter.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea is to recognize such comments as — I don’t like it — or — I don’t understand —
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident — that is, boring and mundane — or the benefits it brings are so limited that it is not worth pursuing.
While a historian, Harvard's Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as the rector of the university, he repeats the same thing several times to get the message across widely.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman believes that TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news online does not mean that the internet is a good medium for advertising, just as the first phone was a popular medium for communication, but a bad alternative for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that one word is enough to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they solved the problem as a collaboration, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not told about the collaboration at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between the two units, performance expert Dave Paradi advises to forget Microsoft’s SmartArt and instead use Diagrammer.com, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital’s cataract surgery banned due to safety risk
A specialist has been suspended from office, and the UK National Health System (NHS) stopped directing patients to cataract surgery in that private hospital after problems with the hospital emerged.
Two people went to Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon said it had been in contact with 19 patients treated on July 26, and invited them to an urgent clinical trial.
Mount Stuart Hospital apologized and said that the matter has been investigated since the doctor was dismissed.
The case came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients treated at Mount Stuart sought its emergency room due to eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all of whom were examined on the same day, have required a repair operation.
The Torbay Hospital and the Southern Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not directed patients to treatment in Mount Stuart since problems arose.
David Sinclair, a temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, which runs Torbay Hospital, said that “we have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to a care provider, we conduct quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, Head of Patient Safety at South Devon and Torbay Hospital District, patient safety is always at the top of the list, so it is important that these cataract surgeries are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe.
Ramsay Health Care UK, which administers Mount Stuart Hospital, sincerely apologized to all patients who experienced complications.
The company was informed that, as soon as we learned of the potential problem, we and later Torbay Hospital called all the patients in question.
This specialist has had a Ramsay Health Care license since 2005, and has been a registered physician since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract surgeries in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of his surgeries have been excellent, with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been suspended from office until the matter has been investigated.
What is -4chan -
Infamous anonymous messaging site first published leaked nude photos of celebrities
What exactly is -4chan - and why was it the hacker's first option when he posted the stolen images?
4chan was founded in 2003 and is a conversation-provoking messaging site that is being barked at as much as praised.
The site is divided into several sections, so-called bulletin boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create a single, continuously used profile and their publications are not retained.
On the most popular bulletin boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute, as newer releases override them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere in the 4chan.
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known memes on the network (such as —rickrolling — and —lolcats), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questionable or downright criminal content on the site.
The most popular message board on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed conversations and regularly displays NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This can include tame porn, but also brutal and shocking images. An anonymous hacker posted stolen photos of celebrities specifically on this bulletin board this weekend.
American CytRx invests in research and development of cancer drugs
CytRx’s goal is to cure cancer, or at least slow it down.
A biopharmaceutical company based in Los Angeles, recently affected by a surge in stock sales, specializes in research and development of cancer drugs.
The most promising drug is aldosterone, which is a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials in the treatment of aldosterone soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma and recurrent glioblastoma or brain tumors.
It’s like a guided missile that goes directly into the tumor and not into the rest of the body,” said Steven Kriegsma, president of CytRx, a cancer medicine from the aldosterone.
Aldoxorubicin contains so-called compound technology that acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly in the blood to a protein that also accumulates in tumors, allowing the drug to pass directly into cancer cells.
The drug is given out only in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
With this technology, more and more doses of the anticancer medicine can be given to the patient.
“It’s like a missile that goes directly into the tumor and not into the rest of the body,” said Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on drug development, CytRx does not make a profit.
The company sold shares this year and thus raised $86 million to maintain its operations and research.
CytRx is currently looking at 400 patients worldwide for a pivotal 3-stage clinical trial of alternative treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and adipose tissue.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when the initial treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to seek authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, says Kriegsman.
The drug could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data released by CytRx from a previous clinical trial in December showed that aldosterone is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
“For a long time, the question was — we haven’t seen clinical data on how much it differs from the drug itself — says Andrew Fein, analyst at H.C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
There are a lot of things that need to be done right, he says.
Fein compares the development of pharmaceuticals to the mining industry.
“First, a lot of money is invested to find that single gold vein, and the investment will continue until that gold vein is found,” he said.
The money will be spent on research and development for so long that the drug can be commercialized.
Several shareholders have sued CytRx because they felt it gave a better picture of the reality of its success.
In the lawsuits, the company is accused of hiring the investment management DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotechnology company for articles published on pages like Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool, and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the lawsuits, it was not clear from the articles that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that they had removed articles that were unpractical.
Several company-related articles were also removed from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the lawsuits.
“I don’t have the time or the energy to focus on this,” Kriegsman said.
The real challenge for CytRx is to find talented employees who tend to find employment in biotechnology centers such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
In many ways, this is a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry, he says.
Views of Analyst
The price of shares in CytRx rose to $8.08 on January 10, and then fell to less than $3 in April, when allegations of promoting shares became public.
According to Analyst, lawsuits and negative publicity have lowered the price of shares below their actual value.
It's unfortunate — Fein says, — but I'm not sure there's any easy way to bypass this matter as long as the perception is in effect —
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed while filming
The photographer of the real-life series, The Law in Finland, died on Tuesday night when she was shot in the middle of a shooting.
The cameraman filmed a shooting between an Omaha police patrol and a suspect in an armed robbery at a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly of his injuries.
Police said a suspect in the shooting, in addition to a cameraman, was killed in an armed robbery.
The first series of reality TV shows in the name of the Law has been aired in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been aired on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of the outside factor arises in the court of appeal proceedings that began today with the killing of Ulvila.
Anneli Auer is accused of murdering her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal is now handling the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court with new evidence.
The purpose of the court of appeal is that the sentence will be issued this year.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal released Auer in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an outside party sufficiently probable.
In his opening speech, the Honorary Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala spoke about the prosecutor’s view of the night of the murder and about the facts that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether an outside factor has entered the house, which has killed Jukka Lahti in the way and time Anneli Auer told us.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's story - Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, the homicide began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he was leaving home and seeking a divorce.
At some point we moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to prevent him from leaving.
One took a kitchen knife —Kulmala described the events of the night of the killing on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several facts prove that there was no external agent present.
For example, there are no sounds from the emergency call recording of an external author.
Auer's oldest child, the daughter, said during the interrogation that she saw the man when he left the door of the fireplace room.
The judgment of the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011 was partly based on the daughter’s report.
Prosecutors say the daughter's observation cannot be true.
“My daughter didn’t see an outsider in her parents’ bedroom, even though she went there twice to see him,” Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness is directly linked to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti’s sister has told about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the daughter told the hospital that she only saw Lahti's body while visiting the killing site in the fireplace room.
Auer's defense intends to present the court with investigation lines, the police said the defense had not sufficiently investigated.
When the Vaasa Court of Appeal acquitted Auer three years ago, the court considered the DNA of a foreign man found in the halo as one of the references of an outsider.
The sample later proved to be the DNA of a researcher working in the Central Criminal Police Laboratory
It was then taken as a mass sample from 700 people DNA sample.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigation lines were excluded — defence attorney Juha Manner said.
One of the new witnesses in the defense speaks of a potential outsider.
A woman from Ulvila told police about a porilaisme, who had reportedly confessed to the act.
Police questioned the man this summer.
The prosecutor made the decision that the porilaism has nothing to do with a homicide.
The prosecutor asked for an investigation because the prosecutor suspected the woman had lied in her report.
One of the new witnesses in the defense is a nurse who was working at the Satakunta Central Hospital on the night of his death.
The Satakunta District Court sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the judgment of the District Court, the possibility of an outsider was contested by Auer’s children’s stories, the emergency centre recording lacks the sounds referring to the outside author, and the time required for the events to take place.
The verdict came by a 2-1 vote.
A minor judge wrote that in the criminal case, conflicting evidence must be interpreted in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter’s report must be interpreted in such a way that, despite the contradictions in the report, she had found an outsider leaving the door of the fireplace room.
Auer's two oldest children have been called to be heard by the Court of Appeal.
The daughter was first heard personally in the Satakunta District Court last year.
When heard in court, he no longer remembered the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named his mother a killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told us in front of a closed door about the night of the murder.
He also said that Auer was planning to kill him for six months.
As a plaintiff, the boy has no obligation to state anything in the court of appeal.
The trial will continue today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the hearing will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin's participation in the G20 be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him one of the first enemies.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is fiercely discussing whether or not to allow him to enter.
Punkrock activist group Pussy Riot called on Australia this weekend to ban Putin from attending a summit attended by more than 4,000 delegates from the world’s most influential states.
“This person, in our opinion, has nothing to do with the G20 meeting,” Maria Alyokhina told the audience at Sydney’s full-packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the verge of a complete war, and Putin calls parts of Ukraine, Novorossia, or the new Russia, does that mean that we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said he's weighing the decision.
Mike Callaghan, head of the G20 at the Lowy Institute Research Center, said Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
“Australia can decide who to let in, but it’s an international meeting,” he said.
Just as New York hosts UN meetings or Washington hosts IMF meetings, it is not up to the host to forbid someone invited to come, Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said — weighing on the decision — after Russia’s reprehensible actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
As Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on it alone.
“However, this is an important issue that I will be weighing a lot on, and I believe other countries will be doing it in the next few weeks,” he said.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The event lasts two days and is attended by a wide range of representatives from the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies, with a total population of about two thirds of the world’s population, making up 85% of the world’s GDP and 75% of international trade.
The members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few specially invited guests from countries outside the G20, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given the questionable task of balancing different interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister's best way of doing this is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
“The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will require President Putin to make an account of his actions.
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to report on his actions,” Callaghan said.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk airport for an attack on Ukrainian military bases in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Putin will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says this may not be known until a few days in advance.
This is the last thing in Putin’s mind.
He hardly states that — I have to change my attitude toward Ukraine, because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November —
Opposition leader Bill Shorten feels that Putin's arrival in Australia - with great reservations - but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the main and foreign ministers to discuss with other states and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events that followed the Malaysian Airlines crash, and in the absence of pity, sense of responsibility and proper cooperation in relation to the plane crash, I think that most Australians are very reservations about welcoming Putin to Australia.
Germany’s business world criticizes Berlin for its self-discrimination
Some of Germany’s top business leaders warn that Germany has become — overly confident — and self-sufficient — as government policies threaten the country’s hard-hitting competitiveness.
Criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government occurs at the same time as Europe's largest economy shows signs of slowing down, causing concern as to whether it will be able to sustain economic growth in a stagnant euro area.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of policy decisions strongly opposed by the German business sector, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the lowering of the retirement age of certain long-serving workers to 63 years.
“I think the biggest threat right now is too much trust in Germany, which inevitably leads to a sense of self-sufficiency,” Kurt Bock, CEO of the world’s largest chemical manufacturer BASF, said in a statement.
The EU economy
This is what he thinks: “In general, there is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to spend and unemployment at a relatively low level.
I think there is a great danger here.
The policy of the German Government shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather that we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German industrial organization BDI, the situation in Germany is now good.
However, over the next ten years, every developed economy will have to change. ...[Germany] The reform agenda will not make as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce (DIHK) has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even the consumption that has slowed down once again is on the rise.
However, the decline in GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% in the previous three months compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to move from public consumption back to public investment, for example by focusing future consumption increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
In Kerber's view, the Merkel government destroys the fruits of his social democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder's strict policy in the early 2000s.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familyunternehmen Foundation, established for family businesses, Germany is still in a good position compared to other countries.
That is thanks to companies, not to government policy. . . .
The example of the neighbouring French country has shown that spending money on social assistance and restricting the freedom to run a business is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more directly, saying that the government's recent decisions are -- a disaster --
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard for, just to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment, the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy that have cost industry competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher to handshake at music festival after security guards block access to fan's
Actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, California, where he is reported to have had a fight with a tight security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
A Kutcher fan tried to approach him at a backstage Stagecoach country music festival in California, after which the situation got out of hand, TMZ said.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to greet and shake hands with him.
When the Star of the Half-Man series went to greet the fan, an overzealous security guard intervened and caused a sleet.
The actor and the security guard got into a handshake, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to hold Kutcher, TMZ says.
After breaking up with his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher dates Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is stars of the former 1970s show.
The stub took place shortly after Angus T. Jones was virtually removed from the regular cast of the hit series after he released a video in which he calls the series — a piece of crap — and urges fans not to watch it.

Angus T. Jones, “Jake” calls the show “junk” and urges people not to look.
Bacteria in the Baltic Sea Killed a Vacationer
Six people have been sickened by a bacteria from the Caribbean, located in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria spread most effectively in brackish waters over 20 degrees.
“Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right — Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Health and Safety Agency of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (LAGuS), told The Local.
The bacteria are found equally in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to LAGuS, the sick person had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks now, and it is possible that his leg must be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound on his leg.
The sick man went to the hospital when he found out on the way home that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus on the leg.
“My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of the danger,” Sonja Bruehl, a sick wife, told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage to the patient and his family could have been avoided if the information had been better available.
LAGuS told the DPA news agency that doctors have been advised to follow the infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official announcement was given.
Cool temperatures have made it possible to reduce the risk of bacterial disease.
“[Monday] test results showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly,” Dr. Will says.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of cholera-causing bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response, such as in HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
Men have a higher risk of developing the disease than women because estrogen has been found to protect against the pathogen.
If a bacterium becomes ill, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
When the bacteria are injured, the probability of death from the disease is about 25%.
V. vulnificus can also be infected by eating the seafood it pollutes, although Dr. Will says that in these cases this is not the case.
Pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died of it.
Vieno Kekkonen: Breast removed due to cancer suspicion
The 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen performs and exercises hard, but has also had to fear for her health.
It’s amazing that Vieno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He is amazed at how many years he can have all of a sudden.
I didn't realize I was this old.
80 years sounds like a lot of fun.
Her birthday is spent with her family.
At the end of August, he was given a birthday party by the Folk Music and Retirement Association in Karttula, where he lived during his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was completely overwhelmed by the party, the birthday hero tells of an event where a stage sized for three hundred was full of congratulations.
A few days later, Muhos met to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers when he was young.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are only a few aspects of Vieno Kekkonen that have not been seen in public.
There is one thing he has never said publicly before: in 2006 he was removed from the other breast.
There was an unclear finding in my chest at a point where it was decided to completely remove it.
It wasn’t cancer, which I was happy about.
A new breast was performed in the same operation, so it was a very big operation.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast in a way that would have been useless, as the knowledge of an unclear finding would have been a heavy strain, and one cannot be left untreated.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that for younger people, losing their breasts is certainly more difficult.

Making a Farmer Guilty of the Sea
The discussion about the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing at the level.
The voice of experts has been drowned in politically purposeful opinions.
In particular, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle have continued the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea during the summer.
In the same breath, rapid action has been required to control emissions.
The average farmer affects a few environmental researchers and with their help, compared to the experienced suppliers, from a superior nutrient expert.
The farmer knows that nutrient leaching cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients have been sown in the field as harvested from there with the harvest.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilizers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
The authorities monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been washed into water bodies after fertilization restrictions, but a clear reduction in emissions has been seen here for years.
Farmers are willing and prepared to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that it is impossible to get to zero.
“If you want us to have roughly the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, you just have to accept that this is the case,” says Jyrki Aakkkula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8).
The past summer brought large blue-green algae deposits to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers were quite unanimous that algae gained its growth power from the ocean’s own phosphorus reserves.
Phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly a drawback of the agriculture of coastal states in the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The wastewater treatment of the growing cities on the Baltic Sea shores remained on the back burner until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned large-scale Helsinki wastewater, and they were not seen as a problem as regards the contamination of their own shores.
The pollution of the beaches was prevented by building a sewage pipeline into the open sea in the 1980s.
Over the years, the quality of the water managed there has improved.
At one time, the nutrients that ended up in the sea will not be removed even if agriculture is completely abolished in Finland.
Yet every summer the blue-green algae debate and the accusations made always concern today’s agriculture.
The public debate marks the farmer as guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
The Greens, led by their chairman, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, are pushing for major changes in the environmental standards of agriculture.
As a springboard, Niinistö has used the summer rest discussion.
Niinistö has accused the producer lobby of old-fashionedness and considered it to be the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be a line of political rhetoric.
Most specific projects in water protection are based on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental management.
The attacking genre of Niinistö serves more fishing for urban green sounds than water conservation.
That's probably the point.
The Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, MTK’s task is to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult for farmers to trade expensive changes unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only money he has offered was cuts from other agricultural funds.
Overturning the mining tax does not go through: Palmer
Abbott's government's latest attempt to throw mining tax into the trash appears doomed to destruction, as Clive Palmer has declared that it will be rejected by his senators without modification.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included a rule in the new initiative that could limit employers' contributions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday to rush through the repeal process in the face of general confusion and the clear indignation of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original annulment initiative, to which the Senate had previously made significant changes, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described as being primarily related to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at abolishing the — unsuccessful — mining tax, as well as other decisions such as the low-income pension contribution ($3.6 billion savings), the income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, the leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP), did not approve the transfer of the government.
“A poorly planned mining tax cancellation initiative will not be approved in the Senate without a pension contribution for low-income people, a bonus for income support and a bonus for school-age children,” he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Shadow Finance Minister Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory guarantee of pension contributions, giving the Finance Minister all the decision-making power.
“This is unprecedented,” he told reporters in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay other increases, with the target of 12% of the Labour Party's pension contributions being transferred up to 2034.
“It is in no way acceptable, and of course the Labour Party will oppose it by all means,” Bowen said.
The guarantee amount is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the finance minister the power to decide to stop future increases.
Man's body found at Brighton Beach
Sussex police picked up the body of an unidentified man before the high tide of the afternoon two, and the police closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
The police and the coroner are working to determine the circumstances under which the body was put on the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
The researchers go through a list of missing persons to find out if the missing persons are connected to the body.
Police were not yet able to confirm whether the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
Mexico police say one person killed by accidental explosion at border
According to Piedras Negras police, an accidental explosion in a customs building on the Mexican-American border caused the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational director of the local police of the city on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in an explosion on Sunday suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning in the overnight stays of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently under investigation, but authorities believe the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect the border guard.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
Male customer plays at Showboat casino to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., July 29, 2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neon-lighted, money machine-clinking metropolis can no longer count on gaming revenue.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed as Showboat and Revel casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press news agency said.
There will be more unemployed as Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
The anticipated closure of three casinos, one of which had only been in operation for two years, is the city’s latest disaster after the Atlantic Club Center’s story ended just eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25 percent of the city’s casino workers, 8,000 people, will be unemployed.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, which suffered from a poor economy.
However, the local gambling industry has gained a lot more rivals as casinos in New York, Delaware, and Pennsylvania cut off much of Atlantic City's once huge casino earnings.
Even Massachusetts, who has previously opposed gambling, is looking at its own portion of the money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule difficult to accept
According to Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), it is difficult to accept Areva’s new assessment that Olkiluoto’s third reactor will not be commercially operational until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction works are already largely completed and the number of work in progress is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
In a statement, Silvennoinen says that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to Areva, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the approval of reactor automation systems, which was received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally scheduled for completion in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is settled in an arbitral tribunal, where Areva has claimed compensation of as much as EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, in turn, considers Areva’s claims unfounded and demands about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders gathered in Stockholm today in the framework of the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time, to ensure adequate water and energy production for an ever-growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are often interdependent.
Energy is needed to pump, store, transport and clean water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two assets are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, who organized the Water Week, said in the opening of the Water Week that the challenges are huge.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water actors to find solutions that will enable all nations of the world to flourish.
This year’s water prize winner, Professor John Briscoe, described water as a potential foundation for growth that is needed by both society as a whole and other sectors.
They need to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that — there is no permanent solution to the [water crisis] anywhere —
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water actors during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI of Sweden at a ceremony in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make decisions that make sense for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami crashed, and 14 people were reported dead.
The same thing has happened to hundreds of people before, and this is certainly not the last of its kind.
Every year, more than 1,000 migrants from Central America die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.
The first city is ready to die.
However, it is ironic that after entering the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either a refuge, an effort board upwards, or a place to spend time waiting for a better opportunity.
Few imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
There is a disproportionately large number of foreign-born and temporary residents living in the preferred cities of immigrants, and death and return to their home countries continue to work in them.
It is estimated that 20 percent of the bodies of those killed in South Florida are being flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of professional slang words human remains) are flown home from Miami International Airport.
As of 1964, according to Pierson, the largest company in the industry, about 80 percent of this traffic goes abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in Central and South America as well as to several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they will die there.
Even after death, homecoming has its cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures in the table describe the human remains flown back home by the airline in 2013.
Returning bodies to your home country is not cheap: prices can range from five to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and general health requirements for the flight and delivery of human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in the cities favored by immigrants sometimes organize funeral communities to help with costs, because the return of corpses is expensive, the government does not help in the process, and the dead are often young people without insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance programs were once created by such communities, founded by Italians, Jews, and Greeks living in New York City — the first immigrant groups in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino and Bangladeshi immigrants are now doing the same in many of their preferred cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few people who have moved abroad plan to make the city their last resting place.
For example, for foreigners who die without a will in Dubai, Sharia law is followed, even if the laws on the inheritance of the deceased home country are different.
The entire property of the deceased is frozen and then distributed in accordance with the Sharia court ruling.
Aer Lingus, Dublin's main hub, is a network of human remnants (
2013) the extent reflects the multicultural demographic structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline suspended the service but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present as a person travels through a town favored by immigrants or while he lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to an immigrant city is an open declaration about the immigrant’s way of looking at life, not death.
Death in an immigrant city abroad, however, means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for an immigrant — decisions about whether to belong to a local or global community, the universe or the country, short-term or eternal.
The Centre Party and the Left Alliance make the Intermediate Issue of Inequality
The opposition parties centre and the Left Alliance intend to make the government an intermediate question about the livelihood of low-income people and the growth of inequality.
The parties want to raise discussion about people's livelihood problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
The growing inequality is also visible between different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out in their statement.
According to the parties, cuts and tax increases in the government’s budget for next year will affect low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family members and ordinary working people, while food, medicines and housing, among other things, continue to increase.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties said in a statement.
The livelihood problems of working people have also worsened.
Parliamentary groups from the Centre Party and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the Finns Party of Finland, has already announced that it will leave an intermediate question on the resources of police and internal security.
The autumn session of the Parliament starts tomorrow Tuesday.
New York City's West Indian Day parade begins soon
Caribbean culture once again reaches the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and where politicians also see each other and become seen.
The annual parade will be held Monday in Brooklyn.
It exudes the celebrations of traditional carnivals prior to the fast period, and part of it are dancers who wear complex, often feathered outfits.
President of the Brooklyn region Eric Adams is this year's festival champion, but there are also many other faces known for politics.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to greet the public a week before the primary elections.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also included violence in previous years.
Police have said they are trying to keep the event safe through additional measures, including monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Are rhetorical questions worth asking?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, right?
There's no point in answering that question.
This figure of speech, that is, a question that is not expected to be answered, but which hints at a particular response, tastes both high-flying speeches and a more mundane exchange of words.
The opening words of Ciceron's famous accusation of Catilina are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is -- How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience --
The same goes for my wife’s questions: “Why shouldn’t I warm a five-day-old chicken to the children?”
Why are you so tense?
The difference theme is a finer word for rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open, and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
The insidious rhetorical question suggests that no sane person could agree with it.
David Williams, author of a 19th-century material writing guide, described the rhetorical question — as words addressed to someone admirably designed to produce a strong sense of truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they pose is an impossibility to disagree —
The art of bending
Rhetorical questions can be asked in succession if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several rhetorical questions that have been asked in succession, designed to express sadness or indignation, are called epiplex.
Job, for example, uses them to appeal to the Almighty: “What benefit do you benefit from oppressing me?”
Do you have the same eyes as us?
Do you see the way a person sees it?
Rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife’s comments: “Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is also a so-called hypophora, which is what is at stake when the question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: “Who is the black private egg that is a sex monster for all women?”
Parru!
That's right, Moses!
Who would sacrifice their lives for their brother?
More examples from my wife: “What is the only food that the children have eaten and from which they may have become sick?”
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely enough, the rhetorical question usually does not seek to persuade, although rhetoric means the art of persuasion.
If you’re trying to talk someone around instead of trying to preach to the already converted or get upset about someone’s stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept one's own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument — and it’s not nice when it’s so sunny out there — the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of what he’s saying, which better ties the speaker and the audience together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no dissenting opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached, rather than seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, complacent.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weak point of argumentation.
In the headlines of the papers, the rhetorical question is all too often the strongest argument possible in a very weak case: “Did aliens build pyramids?”
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the implied answer.
“Do you think what we think?” was the British Conservative Party’s risky campaign statement in the general election in 2005.
The party lost.
For some, the discovery of such cases has become a hobby, and the so-called QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, which is made known by British journalist John Rentoul) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition looking for the best examples.
The contest was clearly won by the song “Do You Wanna Be In My Gang” sung by pop star Gary Glitter before he was revealed to be a child sexual abuser.
The author has also written a book titled “You Talkin’ to Me”
Researcher: Time for a federal compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal government could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian canal that achieving peace in eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
According to Saare, Ukraine’s transformation into a federal state is a priority for Russia’s ambitions in a certain way.
Ukraine certainly rightly suspects that Russia would thereby seek to influence Ukraine’s domestic policy,” he said.
If a federal solution is not reached, the second option could be some kind of frozen conflict from Russia’s point of view, where Russia would effectively control Luhansk and Donetsk.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the allegations, even though, for example, pro-Russian rebels themselves have told us that their troops have been fighting -- on holiday, voluntary Russian soldiers --
Director of Upi: Katainen planned for an influential role
It reminds me that the job is new and still taking shape.
According to him, the idea is that Katainen would somehow coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's new programme for the new period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how the Commission’s power is at its core, says Tiilikainen.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen’s background, financial expertise and role during the economic crisis give him a good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be portfolio-free, meaning that Katainen would not have its own Directorate General under his authority.
Instead, Katainen would become a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment, allowing him to have other portfolios in the field to coordinate in addition to the financial commissioner's portfolio.
In practice, team management could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Mothers of soldiers: 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers, 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine over the past two months, and more than 7,000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights groups, at least 200 Russian soldiers have been killed.
According to the organization, the hospital in Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is crowded with wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of the soldiers gather their information from the relatives of the soldiers.
NATO estimates that there are more than 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
B.B.-Andte on his alcohol use: A little after a drink comes a story...
Big Brother Jussi and Andte were driven Monday night to reflect on the life of the BB house.
On Monday night, Jussi on the basement side pedaled a fitness bike with Andte, a resident of Manor.
The duo wondered what their actions looked like to the viewers of the show.
“Not until you’ve seen it,” Andte said.
According to Jussi, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible celebrations or tasks make up only a fraction of the life of the BB house.
They wait and wonder and talk and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the manor spent the evening in wet weather on Wednesday, and the alcohol got especially on Andte's talkative side.
Jussi asked Andte if the party had made the man’s life more meaningful in the house now that he had been able to talk about them with other residents.
A little drink, and then there'll be a story, Andte admitted.
Watch Andte's interview on ISTV's video!
Let Abreu reveal his body ideals in Me in Women
Anna Abreu says she decided to lose weight two years ago when she was on a break.
At the time, Anna, tired of gigging, thought she would gain more energy with weight loss.
Fred Montana / Splash News
A couple of years ago, Anna dreamed of a body of Victoria's Secret models.
My body was in the Victoria's Secret style.
“I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight,” Anna told the newspaper.
Anna, who presents her body with gigs and music videos, says that she is not a passion trainer, even though she has been named one.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, in Timmi condition, is training in the gym and doing boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can lift a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to eat.
If I do, I really do.
Sometimes I do unhealthy things, and I don't wonder if there's any more kilos.
I wonder what my body thinks.
It makes me sick if I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Shared profits please shareholders but do not increase growth
Are Australian listed companies today simply trying to please a large crowd by agreeing to shareholders' wishes for a larger distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate boards to shareholders served by the Board of Directors?
The distribution of profits is the most important, it was revealed last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programs and distributed more profit have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that capital consumption is declining faster than analysts have predicted. This fact prompts many to ask whether short-term popularity is over-emphasized and whether there is sufficient focus on near-term and long-term growth.
Some companies, of course, return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is acquired, for example, from low-cost stock markets.
From a company’s point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
However, even if the funds raised on the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that the generosity towards shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of this wave of purchase programs (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period — the period of capital decline — during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares small.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrealised capital procurement programmes was $1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it considers spending capital a curse word in one of its headlines.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, unofficial evidence has existed for months.
Glenn Stevens, the head of the Australian Central Bank, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more — a fighting spirit — to increase investment.
Stevens is not worried about the future prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, because slow capital consumption usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
It is said from Credit Suisse that the reporting companies’ own estimates of their capital consumption have fallen by an average of 4% over the past two years.
Estimates of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick glance seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and stock markets, but it is also some kind of proof of corporate obedience.
If I could get a coin every time the CEO has said that the short-term price of a stock is not important, I would... Well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
This claim is, of course, not true.
The CEOs monitor the prices of the shares very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of CEOs are determined by the value of the shares, and the position of the CEOs depends on it.
CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are acquisitions, increased investment in an organization or profit distribution) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for a medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach to investment markets.
Therefore, the current gust of conservatism seems to be in line with short-term goals.
In the opinion of those who assessed cheap stock markets and supported capital saving, this concern does not exist. However, during the reporting period just ended, it was too clear that the weight was in reducing the consumption of future capital, and the most sparing companies were praised.
Large mining companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto held first place in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also did the same — part of the compulsion and part because they were afraid of shareholder reaction.
Why do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse strategist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other, more traditional fixed-profit investment products have decreased, as suddenly central banks have lowered interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors are forced into the capital markets to look for profits, and they in turn pressure companies to share more profit.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose distribution of profits is uncertain.
Investors would rather have the money right away as more and more investors approach retirement age.
Statistics from the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits was largely affected by corporate cost cuts and not by revenue growth.
Leakage of celebrity nude images looks like a data scan or breaking into an email account
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources say the unknown hacker who leaked videos to the internet amazes information security experts and Apple.
While the hacker has published lists of female public figures in a chatroom and said he has more images of women, some of the images have reported that their images are fake while others have said that they were long-runned images.
There are a lot of pictures, including Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton, and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is how did the attack take place.
And were the photos and videos real and where were they downloaded from?
The source that appeared most in the news for the photos — a shameless and in-depth attack on Apple’s iCloud service — is the most unlikely option.
Big companies like Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house to try to infiltrate the company’s own systems on a regular basis.
“A large-scale hack into Apple’s iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim is correct — points out Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hacks associated with public figures (as well as the hacking of less famous people every day) is the leaking of the email address and password, either by guessing or fishing for information, i.e. by tricking a person into logging in to a genuine looking site with their data, and then using this information against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhones to save settings and, above all, to backup images when they are transferred to a cloud server.
The user’s account can be logged into iCloud by entering their email address and password, after which their photos and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has enabled two-factor authentication (2FA), i.e. an additional protection against account intrusion, whereby the owner’s mobile phone will be sent a code before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few use the 2FA feature, either because it is not known, or because it is considered troublesome.
Apple is still investigating whether all the data originated from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely users’ accounts were infiltrated.
The Company has not given an opinion on the matter at the time of the publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson believes it is possible that the hacker has used a “Forgot password” link on Apple’s iCloud service by first collecting the email addresses of public figures, for example from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in several services, when passwords were hijacked through them.
Lawrence's photo publisher claims that the images are genuine, but does not tell when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These pictures were deleted a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took to make a creepy effort.
I have compassion for everyone else who has been hacked — he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought he had removed photos from his mobile phone, but removing the image from a modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in the cloud service because they often do not have room for a large number of photos taken by the user.
The standard setting for Apple’s iPhone is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones save images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, provide automatic image and data storage services.
“People take and delete photos, but don’t realize they’re downloading photos from an account,” Cluley told The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: “Removed doesn’t always mean deleted,” he says.
Photos and videos can be stored for years.
If someone has access to the user’s email address and password, they can redownload all the photos and videos sent by email.
From Apple, images can be downloaded to Mac, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot allegedly showing videos and images taken from Windows PC, which were not yet released.
Two-step authentication protects against such hacking because it requires anyone trying to copy an existing account to another device to give the original user a code sent to the device, usually a mobile phone.
Without code, access to the account will be blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo provide two-step authentication to the account, but it is not yet known whether or how many of them used the service.
Some have said that the pictures they claim to be in are not genuine.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures where Grande is alleged to be are -- completely fake --
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: “The nude pictures supposedly taken from me are FALSE, don’t you understand?”
Let me break the roots of rumors at the very beginning.
Cluley brings up another option.
Because the target of the hack was public figures, their accounts may have been hacked by someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their emails.
“I’d like to know if the actors’ agencies or a representative has any part in the matter — he’s wondering.
However, these public figures do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of a security attack victim or helped configure it, and secretly changed the system so that all data can be recovered.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney, a Florida-based hacker who distributed photos of Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012, and was ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of entering email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry secretly between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera, in the name of this stylist, for pictures of the star as low-cost, and then released the images online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions — certainly one of the worst violations of privacy one can imagine — were
Chaney was also accused of spying on two people online for more than ten years.
According to Cluley, in the case of Chaney, the star e-mail accounts were broken into, and changed so that someone sent their information forward even after the password was changed.
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts -- reminiscent of the collection of butterflies --
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had encountered a list of information and login details in these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
Hackers have also been able to attempt intrusion for a long time.
or they had access to data from an email account, such as an address book, and then fished for other people's data.
I don't think it would be a simple security gap for iCloud.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists linked to al-Qaeda in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to hold 44 Fijian peacekeepers in custody, which captured the crossing site in the Golan Heights last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and their whereabouts are unknown.
At Samoa, ministers attending the UN Conference on Small Emerging Island States, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are deeply concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit, and has offered Australian assistance to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
“I have assured that Australia will help the UN in whatever it can do by providing intelligence assistance, for example,” he told AAP News on Monday.
We keep in very close contact with all the intelligence network partners and friends -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position on the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, a Filipino peacekeeper group held captive in their army barracks was reported to have escaped in a different part of the same disputed area.
The United Nations has been monitoring the Golan Heights since the 1974 ceasefire in Syria and Israel.
Scammers are trying to steal your money through carbon tax repeal initiative, Australian Competition Authority ACCC warns
The scammers are using the carbon tax repeal initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority’s SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses against relying on supposedly government agencies for too good-sounding offers that offer thousands of dollars in credit.
The fraudsters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save on the purchase of commodities after the carbon tax is abolished and offering him up to $7,000, the warning says.
The scammers may sound very convincing because they have cleared the victim’s personal information that they use to try to get hold of bank information or to try to get the victim to pay the fee.
They discuss current issues to trick the victim.
The scammers are using more than just a carbon tax scam to get their hands on money. Their stories are even more sophisticated, and they are taking advantage of current issues to build a scam around them.
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired fraudsters.
ACCC advises to contact the company by using self-explanatory contact information instead of the contact information provided by the caller, if there is the slightest doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation due to the cancellation of the carbon tax, be wary.
If you believe you have been scammed and provided personal information or transferred money to a scammer’s account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money distributed by the government — it probably is.
Economic message: Lipponen accuses EU of sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises EU sanctions against Russia in an interview with the Economic Messages.
Russia’s focus in politics is to pursue its own interests.
The sanctions do not necessarily work, Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started work as an investigator in the business of the Arctic regions of the Confederation of Finnish Industries.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
“This means, for example, that environmental projects in the Northern Dimension, with clear prospects, go on ice,” Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funding now hampers cooperation, which Lipponen says can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic Sea region will continue to be as high as before.
He is currently conducting an assessment of Finland’s Arctic policy and the opportunities of companies in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or by the situation in Russia.
The report looks far ahead, we’re talking about ten years, he says.
It is rare that the norppa comes in shallow water or near settlements, says nature pedagogue Vesa Heinonen from the Ostrobothnian Museum’s lecture centre.
On Sunday, a Norwegian was seen swimming near the beach.
Heinonen says that the Norppa has probably come to Suvilahti for food.
It's not messed up.
This means that there are fish in the area, Heinonen tip.
For example, the Sundom Bridge sees seals, especially in the spring and autumn, which arrive specifically after the fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vaasa sea area.
In the paying country, we see the norm in the villas, he continues.
Norppi lives in the Bothnian Sea and the Archipelago Sea.
The South Australian Court ruled that Robert Vallelonga, the murdered pizzeria owner, acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
Murdered South Australian pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga.
It has been found in court hearings that pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively towards both his partner and security officer for just minutes before being killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers charged with the murder of Vallelonga asked in the lower court of Adelaide for the release of their client against bail, because it was, obviously, a matter of self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been released, behind bars until the trial.
According to evidence, the dead man acted so aggressively that he had to be removed from the club, he said.
Then began the sleet, which resulted in the 40-year-old drunk man -- tearing up the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, the death was caused by one stroke, which clearly refers to self-defense or the defense of another.
A 25-year-old man has just been charged with murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at about 2:25 a.m. on May 4, with serious head injuries.
He died of his injuries at the Royal Hospital of Adelaide early the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers stayed to mourn the local legend of One Tree Hill.
Prosecutors said there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver — that he had put someone to sleep for a few days —
However, the video footage from the security camera now proves something else, Shaw says.
\"It confirms that the dead man acted aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his share of the hard and violent behavior himself,\" he said.
Our client's side has both the assumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
Prosecutors objected to the man's release because only one of the three security men who were present on the night of the crash had intervened in Vallelonga's conduct.
They said other security officers didn't see him as threatening because — he was short — he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that the taxi driver who saw the incident clearly would also prove that Vallelonga was hit — intensely — and had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the following week, when he would declare his decision.
The disputed dolphin yacht began in Japan - justified as a tradition - News from abroad - Evening-Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to put off the start of a widely resented hunt in the world.
The Japanese city of Taiji resumed its annual dolphin hunting season on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A lot of opposition to yachts around the world is reported by the British newspaper Guardian, among others.
In the yachts, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote bay, where mammals are slaughtered after selecting the most suitable individuals to be transported to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also ends up being food.
According to local authorities, however, the start of hunting was expected to be delayed due to poor weather.
Knowledge of the practice spread to the world in 2009 with a documentary film called The Cove on the subject.
During the previous hunting seasons, the yachts have been criticized not only by animal protectors but also by diplomats.
According to opponents, dolphin meat in any case has a limited market due to its high mercury content.
According to those who defend hunting, including the Japanese government, this is a tradition.
Defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
During the weekend, the dolphin hunt was protested by protests in several countries.
In Tokyo, protesters say the yacht is damaging Japan's reputation around the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Part of NATO member states uncertain about the deployment of new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, the views are divided as to whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the Ukraine crisis, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked for a military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
“Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian politics and threatens to overthrow European security,” Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times.
NATO member states will be gathered in the week to begin, and the military alliance is due to announce its new contingency plan.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the 1990 TAE Convention on Conventional Weapons.
In it, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed on how they will deploy armed forces in the area between the Atlantic and Ural Mountains.
In practice, the agreement will prevent new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself suspended its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually opt out of the agreement.
Due to the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO is still asking whether the terms of the agreement need to be complied with.
“Nato’s resources must be available in all NATO countries that need them,” said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Chairman of the Security Committee of the British Parliament, to the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller is the youngest man to fly around the world.
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
The 19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest person to fly around the world — and even alone, according to CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young man in the state of South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries across five continents.
During his journey, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star thanks to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
“Too risky — and —some spoiled, rich puppy just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun”
Guthmiller had little to say to the commentators.
Of course I had a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record I will inspire other people to go out and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight enthusiasm started at a young age, and first he asked his parents to have dinner at the airport cafes.
He later demanded to take flight lessons.
My parents let me on a short, $20-paying, 20-minute tour flight, but I think they thought at the time that my enthusiasm would stop there.
It didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon afterwards made a deal with his parents to give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of getting my own car.
In exchange, I could fly planes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a pilot's license and two years later he chartered a single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT took care of the aircraft himself and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours in the air also meant that he himself needed additional refueling —
A lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookies entirely during a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both wonderful and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no weather radar to help him navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds reached just a little above the plane and which ones reached 45,000 feet in height and tore the plane apart.
Guthmiller's aircraft was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel on the plane would not have been higher.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane crashed on a flight between Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he finds the take-off phase technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel needed for a 16-hour flight.
However, despite the risks and even the fear of high-place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for computer training through Code.org.
He is a coder himself, and founded his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but let’s see how it goes.
In any case, Guthmiller is going to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchisee is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited when fans queued for her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores across Canada after Canada's W-TV channel began showing The Cupcake Girls reality show in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchise entrepreneur was not suitable for the job.
“My Franchise entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that 100 potential customers are waiting outside the store ready to buy a cupcake and he can’t handle the situation,” Joyce said.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge missed opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process of franchise partners, starting with emphasising the management skills that match the company’s culture rather than baking skills.
\"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear -- he says, adding that he has conducted about a hundred interviews for each of the 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of training, but our employees work in a completely different way in the work environment, so the whole process is quite difficult. This is why our training emphasises, above all, the suitability of the company culture.
Finding the right franchisee is vital to the development of any small business.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow an organization, while a poorly suited manager can cause costly damage to a company.
“I used to think looking for a franchise entrepreneur was like dating, but that’s not true at all, there’s a lot you can do to get to know someone before getting married,” Joyce said.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a contract is signed, a security deposit is obtained and a new store is built.
Having a partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a significant confidence test.
The symbiotic relationship of the Franchise parties resembles a strong marriage as they share common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
Therefore, McLachlan also believes that a franchisee should be careful in choosing a future franchisee before entering into such a long-term partnership.
“This applies to the same idea as to relationships: if a date is rude on a date, imagine how she is married,” he said.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contractual partner and to pay attention to even the smallest alarm signs on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchise givers like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time being franchise givers need to be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, the new franchise providers must conclude, presumably, on the basis of a successful parent company, what challenges they have had to face and what skills a new franchise entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, franchise providers can also ask franchise advisors to help create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time, there is a lot of help available for franchise lenders and entrepreneurs on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will become easier later, because franchise givers will learn to better assess potential entrepreneurs, but also because the first franchise entrepreneurs will be able to give advice and help with evaluation.
“The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in creating the company and franchise system — says Erik Church, operational director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he could not have created alone, so the first franchise entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church, there are 216 franchise entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a Toronto franchise partner for You Move Me.
Chrouch’s method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
“One of the confidence tests we have is to ask ourselves, ‘Would I invite this person to a weekend barbecue?’” he says.
“If the answer to this question is ‘no’, you probably don’t want to spend much of your work day looking for solutions to big business challenges with them.”
Church further points out that the O2E Brands company is largely grateful for its franchise structure's success.
In a business organization, managers often see their own position as short-term and the relationship to the lower management level as very official, while franchise entrepreneurs engage in a partnership with long-term goals and thus become more committed to the success of the company.
“Franchise partnership has many more advantages compared to traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense,” he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but if well managed, it will produce better results.
Rail delays lower cereal prices in the north of the United States
Delayed train transport has led to a significant fall in cereal prices in the northern central United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to put the transport network under new pressure.
Commercial grain silos in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 from bushel - about a dollar less than control prices - the reason, above all, for the cost of securing the capacity of oncoming rail tracks, merchants and agricultural organizations say.
IN Raw materials
The most acute problems are Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway on BNSF Railways and Canadian Pacific Railways.
The federal railway supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains have to rely on railways to transport agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
Delays in train transport increased as the rich harvest of 2013 was followed by a very cold winter, which caused train slowness and shortening.
Some farmers believe that the increased transportation of crude oil from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale formation has displaced grain transport, which is not true, according to railway companies.
According to a director of an international grain trading firm, the cost of ensuring the use of the train by grain-storage and moving sellers has risen from zero to up to $2,000 to $2,000 per wagon per year.
Someone has to pay the expenses.
“These costs will be paid either by the farmer or by the customer,” says the director of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that North Dakota’s soybean harvest will increase by more than a third and spring grain crop by 16%.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, said: “We are trying to start a new crop from a clean table, that is, enough storage space has been emptied for the crop and the grain has been sold and transferred.
However, we are now starting late due to the service problems of the trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transportation of this year’s crop smoothly.
John Miller, vice-president of BNSF's agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the number of long-distance transports (traincars ordered by customers that have taken more than four days to deliver) from the peak of early April, 16,500, to about two thousand.
“We’ve moved almost everything from the old crop we were supposed to move,” Miller said, referring to the surplus grain from the previous crop.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF grain trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is “uneven” but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all types of transport products, such as grain congestion peaks.
The train speeds of the Canadian Pacific railway company, which suffered from problems, are 11 percent lower than last year, but clearly higher than the low speeds of the early part of the year.
The Canadian Pacific railway company has told the Surface Transportation Board that the changes made to its train wagons ordering system should improve its ability to handle traffic by 15-20% in the coming harvest season.
“The Canadian Pacific railway company’s autumn action plan focuses on continuous improvements in train speed and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more train wagons every week,” said a spokesperson for the railway company.
The Ukraine crisis could solve the NATO identity crisis.
Leaders, diplomats and experts from large countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's mission in Afghanistan will also mean the end of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident at the NATO summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, attended by 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama of the United States.
There is no shortage of global crises on the agenda of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the withdrawal of Afghan troops, which used to be a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
Instead, a union of 28 states is needed after Russia re-invades Ukraine, a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also be moving troops, promising more money for defense spending and re-engaging in defence cooperation.
In some ways, NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
“It (NATO) was in some way looking for its purpose — and it was going through a rather significant identity crisis — says Heather Conley, director of the European program for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to persuade world leaders to establish a common strategy to defeat the militants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the president will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his war-tired collaborators to a military response, especially one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
President Obama, however, is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to defeat extremist Islamists, after directly stating — we have no strategy —
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether Ukraine or the Islamic State will be reached in discussions about breakthroughs.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main punishment for an event called the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
European Union officials discussed the issue over the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
U.S. officials pointed out that the states from which Obama wants the main partners in the Islamist problem are not necessarily NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not be foreseen two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, then-leader Robert M. Gates made his final speech in his position to say that the organization has almost reached a point of common military importance.
U.S. officials constantly complained that other countries were unable to reach their funding targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence spending, but only four Member States - Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States - achieved this goal last year.
White House officials said they noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff promising to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire as the Member States notice potential threats in their actual size.
After Russia invades Ukraine, defense promises are more significant and important than ever since the end of the Cold War,” said Charles Kupchan, president of the National Security Council of the United States.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach consensus among the 28 Member States.
Obama is using much of his journey to strengthen his commitment to defence cooperation for the benefit of Russia’s worried neighbours.
The President starts his three-day trip with a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new contingency plan will be introduced this week.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks on border states, officials say.
The plan includes the addition of air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation signs.
The changes entail a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of kindness to Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it can also be a semantic distinction, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name to be made public during the discussions before the official announcement.
NATO's presence will likely be described as long-term, not permanent,\" the diplomat said.
Putin's effective -- winter -- is he using it for Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve for Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
This is why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine escalates, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia holds the trump card: winter is coming, and the main source of energy in Ukraine is Russia.
According to an American official, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), according to Geysar Gurbanov, who works at Harvard University.
When the winter comes to Ukraine in less than four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country, the Ukrainians freeze into their homes as the supply of gas from Russia stops.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia's energy giant, will help Putin win the war in the end.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine’s debt from gas amounted to USD 5.3 billion (about EUR 4 billion) by August 1.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
“I don’t think anyone is thinking about it (winter) anymore, except Russia,” Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier to solve.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to replenish stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and prepared for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not back down in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman's Japanese holding company, Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks on humanitarian intervention and planning a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will intensify in a few months if Russia can sustain the separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies, unless Kiev begins to pay the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenjuk said Russia was planning to halt gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak later said that the talks were false.
Russia is doing everything it can to supply gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes
The Saudi court has held a ten-year prison sentence for Raif Badaw, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement, in May.
The sentence includes an additional penalty of 1,000 lashes and a fine of one million riyals (approximately EUR 200 000).
The verdict was justified by the fact that he had set up a website that defamed Islam.
Suad al-Shamari, the co-founder of the organization, told AFP on Monday.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
In July 2013, Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but the sentence was appealed and returned to trial.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when its injustice was also pointed out by Amnesty International.
Riku Rantala’s childhood experience in Afghanistan: “It was one of the most revolutionary human encounters”
Madventures today published a new book, The World Explainer - The Adventurer's Explanation of Everything.
We asked Riku Rantala about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells about the most significant human encounter of his life.
Writer, journalist, Riku Rantala, the other side of Madventures, is a busy man.
A new book has been published today, a movie picnic was held yesterday at the Public Square and the second season of Docventures begins on Wednesday.
Since morning he has been running from one place to another.
From the morning TV to the daycare centre and from there to a weekly meeting.
A face-to-face interview must be turned into a telephone interview.
Otherwise, there's no time.
In the midst of all the hassle, he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Miltonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explainer book, which, according to the cover text of the book, is an adventurer's manual for everything.
Everything?
Wow, a lot of promise.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why one culture is doing worse than the other, why we are here and who we really are.
We used the interviews we’ve done over the years.
The book has experts from both professors and artists.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've had a pretty big bite in the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions are worth considering, because that’s when we’ll do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis of the book is to be a good travel read, but its purpose is also to get people to discuss and share ideas at home.
The discussion can even lead to action, Riku says.

One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the world, we have to believe that at some point we will be making decisions to improve our situation.
The world is a kind of alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can there be a change, Riku philosophizes.
According to Riku, some studies have shown that Western humanity has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
From this it can be concluded that when there is enough money and our basic need is satisfied, we are happy.
Money does not increase happiness.
We want to get people to talk about what is enough.
The use of our natural resources will not last long, Riku says.
In your book, you are also thinking about cultural differences.
How is Indian people different from Finnish people?
People don’t differ very much.
Of course, the starting points for education, health care and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the importance of the community is much greater in India, both for good and for bad.
When the West is prosperous, people live more alone.
Isolate yourself from others and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found the right balance between community and being alone, we would be pretty close to happiness.
Riku has met a lot of different people around the world.
Which human encounter is best impressed on his mind?
It takes place in my childhood, when I was with my family on my first major trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was working for the United Nations.
I was seven years old and my two younger siblings were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku starts.
They came home to Finland with a large moving car.
We drove a war-torn Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees at the side of the road.
A girl my age walked along the road carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a large Mercedes bench with a Coke tin in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age understands the situation.
It was one of the most revolutionary human encounters I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Then Rikulla -- went to cabbage -- that other people must be respected, even if they are much poorer or do not have the same conditions for life as we do.
At the time, Riku realized that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adulthood, people in New Guinea rise to the surface.
I couldn’t stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to their advantage in everything, they hardly use money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
Surviving is really hard.
It made me think.
And to think about it, she wants to have her new book readers too.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would make people act from warm-hearted making love to conversation or even a fist fight, Riku throws.
This is reported in the journal Kauhajoki.
The events started when the couple arrived by bus at the station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi started moving, a man in the yard threw something after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as did the man who was the passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed the man’s passenger in the head and in the hand and left the scene.
The knife is a 170-75 centimeter-long stubble, short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blonde ponytailed woman near the scene.
He is expected to contact the police.
The police are also asking for clues from anyone who may have made observations of the events or persons involved.
The shooting took place on Wednesday 27 August at 7:50 p.m.
“Hi,” said the brain to the brain, “the world’s first telepathic message passed through the internet.
The journal PLoS ONE has published an article stating that the international team of researchers was the first to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were —hola — and —ciao — i.e. in Spanish and Italian — moi —
In the experiment, the electric brain curve of the sender was monitored.
The sender was trained using the program to send bits either by thinking of hand or foot movement.
Imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and moving hands to one.
This bit-coded information was sent through the internet to the recipient person.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation to detect a flash of light for each bit encoded as number one.
The receiver was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still a field of research in their children's shoes, but believe that computer-assisted telepathic communication is routine in the near future for mankind.
Sanctions - Punkti - The future of rural areas
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia fought in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, action is followed by reaction, action against action.
Experience shows that all sanctions only bite in the long term.
Iran was not allowed to negotiate its nuclear program until years later.
The South African government of racial oppression sat still for decades, although trade was banned by UN rulings.
Sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export high-end electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world's side.
The last time the wood was frozen was the raw wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the trade does not cause panic.
When the EU wants to ban the import of vodka from Russia, this is mostly a joke.
The Russians like to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The flow of gas from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is not the drop in the import of cheese or the export of vodka.
The biggest disadvantage comes from the constraints of the financial sector.
It will only affect you in the future.
The Russian government cannot operate in the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Even though Russia has huge reserves of currency, they do not last forever.
Russian companies' access to credit is declining and money is rising.
Banks are not able to finance everyone.
More money needs to be paid or companies will have difficulty paying.
Bankruptcy is bankrupt in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernization of Russia will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would return to Russia once again and curl up inward.
An exceptional free wrestling event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international free wrestling matches held in the capital of Pyongyang on Saturday.
The event organized by Japanese lawyer Antonio Inoki took part in wrestlers from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free wrestling matches, Taekwondo matches by local athletes were also seen.
According to Inok, the aim of the event was to bring the countries in conflict closer and to promote world peace through sport.
In their speeches, politicians hoped for a better relationship between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of Japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen investigations into these cases.
The last time North Korea saw international free wrestling was in 1995.
SOK will reduce approximately 110 people from the organisation of the consumer goods trade.
Yt negotiations began in June, when a maximum reduction requirement of 130 was estimated.
According to the company, its organisation has now dismantled overlapping operations and the areas of responsibility have been clarified.
SOK says that its actions seek clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the recession in the economy and the fall in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade, which has shaken trade in consumer goods in particular.
The result of S Group’s consumer goods trade has been at a loss for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all SOK’s employees and management in the operation and grocery trade, i.e. a total of approximately 530 people.
Turun Sanomat: Some self-medication medicines behind the counter
According to the magazine, there are more medicines coming between prescription drugs and self-absorbing medicines that you can get without a prescription, but only after the advice of a pharmacy worker.
According to the Finnish Association of Pharmacies, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be covered by counselling.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and meeting pre-defined criteria, the medicine should be given behind the counter, says Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Association of Pharmacies in Turun Sanomat.
There are already a few medicines available without a prescription in Finland, but they require advice.
One of these is emergency contraception.
Corruption for more precise reasons
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed by the limited amount of bribery and bribery cases in Finland.
By the end of the year, the working group of the Ministry of Justice will consider whether the Sections of the Criminal Code would be needed on the trading and abuse of influence.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the trial of Patria's bribery case in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
Trade in influence brought two years in prison for the former Prime Minister of Slovenia, but Finnish law does not know the same criminal code.
The cooperation network against corruption has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recent survey, there is little research into bribery in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police College on the vulnerability to corruption in various fields.
Messi potee groin injury - Sports - Karelian
Argentina's national football team captain Lionel Messi will miss Wednesday's national game against Germany.
Messi keeps the stand side groin injury, said his club Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona keeps Messi on the sidelines as a precaution.
Messi injured the groin in a Sunday league match against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he can recruit for Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many of Western Sydney Wanderers team players are banned in the first match, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Champions League witch pot in the FC Seoul match.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly matches in Abu Dhabi, so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final match to be held on September 17.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole miss the Korean voyage, but coach Popovic believes in their recruits.
“Of course this is a loss — they’ve been three very important players in ACL for us,” Popovic said.
Tomi Juric was banned in China for this gesture.
After all, it is a setback, none of the players should be absent, but we did not have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, he must have done a lot of work, and I have complete confidence in the entire team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone in the semi-finals.
The Wanderers also have to be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defender of The Socceroos was injured before the season began, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in a return match at Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
“He’s back in his career and he’s recovering well,” Popovic said.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already been practicing outside a couple of times, which is good.
It will take some time before he is completely fine, but he will recover well.
In Dubai, the Wanderers have the world's top facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also feels that the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes at the end of last season.
“We know this will certainly help players create ties,” Popovic said.
We have a lot of new players and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on and off the pitch.

Elite hamburger pays three times the monthly wage of the worker
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the elite of the country.
The Financial Times reports on the economy torn by contrasts.
In North Korea, the informal market is likely to flourish more than ever.
They offer ordinary citizens who are wealthy or frugal a luxury that is not used to being associated with a dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: an entertainment center where a ticket alone costs up to ten months of an ordinary worker's salary.
There's hamburgers out there that cost $76.
It is a 3-5 month salary for the country's regular job.
In the swimming pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
North Korea’s western market began in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even though the prices of supplies may at worst be outrageous.
Yet in the capital, Pyongyang, many have a mobile phone with an ovh of $200.
Part of the cause may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
During his time, the administration has emphasized the importance of technology in the country's flourishing.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council hopeful about sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council purchased a 19th-century building in the eastern parts of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, with the safety and maintenance of the building costing the Council about £400 a day.
The building was sold for £1.25 million.
The building will obviously be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a building classified as category B with historical value for £9 million in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was re-sold at a price of £2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Ulster Unionist party Mike Nesbitt proposed that Ormiston House might fit into the facilities of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is engaged in negotiations on the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner as soon as the paperwork is completed.
Both the council and the real estate agent remain silent about the buyer's identity and the selling price.
Ormiston House’s weekly security and repair costs are around £3,000.
The Council purchased the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
Ormiston House's security costs by the beginning of this year totaled £885,641 and maintenance costs £371,379.
The cost of professional repair and maintenance services was £250,015 and the fees for development and design professionals were £212,466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie. Pirrie later became president of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after the death of Lord Pirrie in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building, selling it in 1928 to Campbell College, who held it until the mid-1970s.
Increasing inequality: Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There is no savings, according to JHL.
A radical reduction in the number of school assistants is being prepared in Helsinki.
The reduction would not apply to the child's personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Education Board ended up presenting a total of approximately 2.7 million reductions in the resources of school assistants.
There are a total of approximately 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the contractions occur, they will take effect during the semester from the beginning of the year.
According to the JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, for austerity reasons, it is unfortunately easy to reduce the number of assistants, because the amount of support for learning is not clearly defined by law.
There will certainly be no savings; on the contrary, the workload of the teaching staff will increase.
The schoolchildren’s savings bring an even greater risk of dropping out of their learning goals, and the ability to cope with teachers is tough, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Director of Sectors at JHL.
The City of Helsinki’s plans differentiate schools, because with future resources, small schools and pupils in need of support will no longer receive assistant resources at all.
The aim of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is done by school assistants.
However, the Agency’s adjustment measures are mostly targeted at this group.
In the future, all parties will suffer.
The final solution of the resources will be made by the Helsinki City Council in the autumn, to which I wish to see the vision and wisdom of looking far into the future and to act in accordance with its objectives,” says Niemi-Laine.
Israel takes over the West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the settlement of Etzion near Bethlehem.
Israel seized nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem on Sunday, a sign of Israel's future major construction in the region, while defiantly defying the Palestinian request not to build more settlements and defy the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli-Peace Now Group, which opposes the expansion of the West Bank settlements, felt that Sunday's events could be the largest single invasion of the West Bank region in decades and could -- dramatically change the situation in the region --
The aim of the Palestinians is to establish their own state in the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to Israeli authorities, the political impetus to assess the situation in the land area came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they hitchhiked in the area.
In July, Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was accused of being the main perpetrator of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the land invasion suggests that it was intended as a form of compensation for the population of settlement and a punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish settlement of Gevaot in the Etzion settlement of southern Jerusalem, the land has now been officially declared — a state country — when it was formerly privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step for Israel to start planning buildings for the area if it wishes.
However, Ahmad Lafi, mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff issued orders early Sunday in which Israel announced that it would take lands containing the plantations of Surif and nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukini, including olive and other trees.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people prompted the Israeli army to carry out a retaliation in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamist group ruling Gaza, which Israel says was behind the abductions.
The ensuing tensions on the Israeli-Gaza border sparked a 50-day war that ended last week with Egypt's ceasefire.
The conquest of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli-controlled West Bank and has revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government, which hamper the broader development of the peace process between Israel and Palestine.
Lapland’s crisis communities are usually multi-problematic
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are facing problems, according to a well-being study prepared by the University of Lapland and the University of Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, reducing municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not enough.
Common features of crisis communities include poor local government finances, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Emeritus Asko Suikkanen of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis communities are coming from the western border and eastern Lapland.
In the survey section, residents assessed the situation in their municipality quite realistically.
In the study, residents of well-performing municipalities were even pessimistic about the prospects.
High expectations affect consumption.
People hope that their current everyday life and well-being will be preserved, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time period, we do not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as the purchase of an apartment, says Suikkanen.
The research group was surprised by the large differences between municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita ranges from a couple of tens to well over a hundred euros.
The tax revenues received by the municipality per capita range from EUR 2 thousand in Ranua to EUR 4400 in Pelkosenniemi.
According to Suikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much government contributions are made, and what is the degree of indebtedness is much different in municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders on returning Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily block the return of Islamist fighters to Iraq and Syria.
That is what the BBC has to say about the sources of government.
The BBC said British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to retain their citizenship.
According to a government source, this is one of many proposals to be considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr welcomes Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor's immediate release from Libyan prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from Libyan prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian attorney Melinda Taylor today.
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that “everything is going well” and an International Criminal Court lawyer will be released from custody of the Australian authorities this evening, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
“We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today,” a spokesperson told AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its assistance and support, the representative said.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before continuing her journey to her home in The Hague.
Taylor and three of her criminal court lawyers were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintani on 7 June while representing Seif al-Islam, son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to Libyan officials, Taylor took documents to Seif, which they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has worked hard to free Taylor, including traveling to the Libyan capital of Tripoli last month to pursue his cause.
Taylor had not been able to talk to her husband or little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to her home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with John and Janelle, Taylor's parents in Brisbane, who were relieved to learn that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya to release her daughter before her baby's third birthday in July.
Three other arrested criminal justice lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of a conversation between a lawyer released in The Hague and Libyan authorities — a lawyer at the criminal court was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding —
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of errors, but has promised to thoroughly investigate the actions of its team after its members return home.
“After the International Criminal Court has closed its investigation, it will ensure that anyone who has acted wrongly will be properly convicted,” the court said in a statement last month.
The International Criminal Court calls for trial of 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May to declare that it would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
A young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took its second win in the early stages of the Spanish Football League, but with ease Villarreal did not fall in his home.
The blue-reds pushed their heads to Villarreal watchman Sergio Asenjo until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
The winning goal was scored by a surprising man: the 19-year-old, who made his first appearance in La Liga, the attacker Sandro Ramirez had entered the field just 12 minutes earlier.
The young man, who received an invitation from Barcelona's second team, finished close by after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Messi's attempt.
Collections of Ferguson police mysteriously ended after $433,000 in crossing
The administrators closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the sites collected more than $400,000 to police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity site open to the general public, two separate pages bearing similar names — Support Officer Darren Wilson — and — Support Officer Wilson — have collected $235,750 and $197,620 for the Fenguson police that shot Michael Brown.
A similar site maintained by Brown's family lawyer had raised $314,099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and demonstration mostly against the nearly white police forces of the black-populated Ferguson, who forced Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations were trying to decide whether he shot Brown for no reason.
Network collection campaigns have sparked some controversy over Wilson's defence, especially after some visitors had posted racist comments on the comment section, which have since been deleted.
Both pages apparently stopped accepting donations at roughly the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators did not give a reason for this.
When a visitor tries to give a donation, he sees a message that says “Donations are no longer accepted!”
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
A spokesman for the GoFundMe website on Sunday issued a statement to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not blocked donations.
“Every GoFundMe campaign organiser decides when they want to stop receiving donations,” Kelsea Little, a spokesperson for GoFundMe, said in a statement.
Organizers can also continue to receive donations later if they wish.
The Support Officer Wilson page, with a return of $197,620, is operated by a charity group of St. Louis police officers, Shield of Hope, a recipient of donations approved by GoFundMe.
Three police officers, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, registered as official representatives of the State Collection Register of the Shield of Hope group, did not respond immediately on Sunday to emails asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official spokesperson for Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of Florissant City Council nearby and a member of the House of Representatives of Roorda Missouri.
Nor did The Times immediately get in touch with the anonymous founder of the Support Officer Darren Wilson page, who uses the name “Stand Up” and has raised $235,750.
However, in a statement to The Times, a spokesman for GoFundMe asserted that an anonymous philanthropist exists.
The anonymous benefactor of the collection campaign has been given little information to donors, unlike administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
An anonymous Wilson-page philanthropist wrote a message to visitors of the site two weeks ago that the site is collaborating with the Shield of Hope group to become officially accepted as a recipient of donations.
Approval has not yet been given.
The philanthropist provided additional information to visitors who wanted to receive a pseudonymized Gmail email address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to a request for further information.
A spokesman for the GoFundMe page said in a statement to The Times that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the main site's search results and added that -the campaign no longer meets the requirements stated by GoFundMe that a working Facebook account should be available -
In GoFundMe’s information security policies, users are advised to donate only to GoFundMe users they know personally and rely on.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on GoFundMe is accurate and honest.
According to Representative Little, GoFundMe has, however, been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to detain any funds collected if it is necessary to initiate investigations in connection with any campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to withhold funds collected by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page, Support Officer Wilson, which has organized campaigns to support Wilson, told the website's followers over the weekend that lawyers are trying to find -- an explanation -- why donors of GoFundMe have been blocked from donating, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page, and these comments have not been verified by an independent source.
Arsenal's top attacker at the end of the year - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
English Premier League Arsenal's French attacker Olivier Giroud is likely to be sidelined until the turn of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut Wednesday and recovery takes months.

Central Finland: Finns rely on the security of online banks
Most Finns rely on the security of online banks, reports Keskisuomalainen.
According to a survey commissioned by the magazine, four out of five consider the security of online banks to be good.
The age of the respondents is clearly shown in the answers.
Most people believe in the security of online banks, the least in pensioners.
The leading lawyer of the Consumer Union, Tuula Sario, is not surprised by the views.
A lot of internet users usually rely on its services the most.
Those who do not use the services, on the other hand, are ignorant and suspicious.
Most of the Finns are a customer of an online bank.
The most common way is to use a computer, but the use of mobile devices is becoming more and more common.
A thousand Finns responded to Tietoykkönen Oy’s survey in August.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and the Screenwriter of the Silta series together to make a crime series
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's best-known crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, the screenwriter of the popular Silta series, are working together on a new TV series.
The 10-part Advokaten series is set to begin next year.
Swedish production company Tre Vänner announced the project on Monday.
The series was purchased by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
Advokaten, based in Stockholm, tells the story of a young lawyer named Frank, who, in one case, finds dark connections between his own family and notorious criminal groups.
Lapidus, a criminal writer who has risen to fame with a novel, is a defense attorney from his civil profession.
