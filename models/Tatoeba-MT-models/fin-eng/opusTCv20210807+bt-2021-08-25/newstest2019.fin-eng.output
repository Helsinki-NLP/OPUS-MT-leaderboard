Eemeli Kouki leads Hurricane home win in opening - Savo Volley second win
As a result, Hurricane Loimaa, who had been in the Men's Volleyball Championship medals seven times in a row, started the 2018-19 season with a home win, when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most powerful hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't come true, and then a call came from Loimana.
It was very quick to get things done, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimus, also supported Kouki by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team hacker Samuli Kaislasalo, who played on a match-specific contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many of the players had experience from the other side, and it brought additional extras to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but the continuation of the medal tube is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volleyball 's
Miro Määttänen was the most effective Savo Volleyball player with 18 points when the team knocked down the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 by the side.
Our game was volatile, especially on the offensive head, but luckily we were able to squeeze the win.
I didn’t have any consciously different downloads when I played against my former team,” Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball in the 3-series 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, with the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
A good feeling left in the home opening.
Miro was the king, Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver at Pielaveden Sammo while Tuovinen was also the head coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was the most powerful of the Ducks by 14 points.
Akaa - Volley 's
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league scoring, has also started this season strongly.
The chipper scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening win after knocking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well for me.
Today we had a close defeat, as we were in the fourth period 17-21.
A win was mined, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most powerful scorer was Edwards Buivids.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
There was not a lot to be said about this guy, Michael said.
Finland ranked number one in the world in comparison of human capital
Finland is one of the world’s leading comparisons of human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands followed Finland.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst in the comparison.
When measuring human capital, we look at the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has pointed out that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched into splendor combat, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian watchman Courtois managed to fight back.
Courtois played three seasons in Atletico while on loan while being a Chelsea player.
In the beginning of the week, the International Football Association FIFA selected him as goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale scored best, but his shot was missed at the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale missed a break because of a femoral injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a goal cannon who moved to Juventus in the match.
In the United States, abortion rights are now being attacked - a powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate appointed by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine Supreme Court members.
In the Republican Party, many people hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice will reverse the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has come to light over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from most of our members of parliament.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only abortion physician in the state of Missouri due to law enforcement.
The clinic's armed security guard says he defends American religious freedom.
The news videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
This is the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
A consortium of Lutheran churchmen then guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even needed, a photo of a woman who died of self-imposed abortion is enough.
There were deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legalization of abortions was defended especially by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967 in California, abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, that began to twist religion into politics in order to attract voters.
His abortion position also revolved around his successor George Bush senior.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document reaches the deepest point of the matter in its search for the root cause of the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When religious organizations that supported racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
At the time of writing this, the U.S. is in a situation where the president, who boasted with his suate harassment but has seized the voices of the religious right with his abortion stance, has elected Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court candidate, now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may gain the power based on the scale language position to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - at border with major protests
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired at protesters in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and aired the border zone when protesters threw Israeli troops with rocks and explosives.
The army says it has begun to use force that protesters will not break down the border fence or seek its way to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
Protesters demanded that Palestinian families have access to the territories from which the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by kites and helium balls from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
He got a penalty shot and couldn’t shoot himself.
Wigan's top-notch Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Santa couldn’t believe his eyes.
I think the situation was plagued by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was overthrown.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic shook a 1-0 win goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish pectoral muscle.
I liked working for Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
Pedophile assistance service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Criminal Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, a flood of emails and appointments were booked very quickly at Sexpo, providing advice and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a shame for many.
The majority of those who consider pedophile emotions in themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus did nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life,” says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist at Yle, who is a specialist in the project.
“I think work is valuable if one child is spared from sexual violence,” Thesleff said.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound sudden, but based on betting odds, Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the award.
Trump’s role in getting North Korea, at least at the level of talks, is to commit to nuclear disarmament.
The biggest favourites of the Nobel Peace Prize winners are South Korean President Moon Jae-i and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace treaty between their countries.
Warming between the Koreas is significant, as last year the relations were still good.
However, rewarding Kim, who has spent years with nuclear weapons and his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Prizes will be announced from Monday onwards, and Friday will be the most noteworthy, the Peace Prize.
If the award is not given to those who participated in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become a leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege’s work has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered to be the UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has announced that there will be 331 candidates for the award this year.
The names of the candidates are not disclosed to the public.
Trump himself would not mind a Nobel prize.
In May, the reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself,” Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
“The prize I want is a victory for the world,” the president continued, referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are things that make Trump’s Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the prize, has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump’s reward would therefore require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in tunnel: Drivers behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos in Lohja on the first row occurred on 8 September.
Due to the announcement, the traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened, because there are motorists on the road who are in shock and they drive how it hurts,” on-call fire chief Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
At that time, the motorway was driven in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, says Tapio Heiskanen, Communications Manager at Liikenneturva.
According to the traffic rules, only for compelling reasons can you stop on motorways and tunnels.
Traffic security reminds us that in exceptional situations, you cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall at all times be provided with the most unhindered movement possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is the making of a u-turn and withdrawal.
The same bans apply in tunnels, where headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
In recent times, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity,” Heiskanen says in a statement.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even if the ship was caught in the lakebed
The Ilves fans transported by the Inland Watership M/S Tampere would have liked to have stayed on board the ship to continue the victory celebration, even if the ship had been caught in the lakebed from its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s chief at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught at the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew aboard the ship were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was injured in the haver.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board the ship until morning, but of course it was more sensible to send them to the port with the fire department and take the bus home,” Syrjä told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3-win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday’s hash was due to the fact that the surface of the water in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than usual.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest bus sign was covered with log residues, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more marked collision
Haveri happened to the west of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ferry route had passed the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater drama in the case, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or imprints on the ship and, in these circumstances, the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver checked the ship's condition before towing the ship off the shallows.
For sure, we will go to the shipyard to check that no damage has been caused, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that M/S Tampere’s next cruise, booked next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The rescue service received an alert about the incident on Saturday night, shortly after half past twelve.
The port of Viiala was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but ambulances were not used.
On-call firefighter Matti Willman told late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather hard wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half past three on the night of Sunday that all passengers on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump judge accused of bullying and drinking may be missing top post
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court as a judge, may well be missing the post he is seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during their studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in the office of someone else.
In the United States, it has been reported from time to time that the presidential candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice has raised a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
The president has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would rain on the Democratic garrison
The U.S. Supreme Court tends to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically highly sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision will probably rain on the Democratic Party's ranks in the upcoming congressional midterms.
It would increase voting enthusiasm among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment does not occur for every term of office, as the Supreme Court judges in the United States are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request between the ages of 70 and 80.
Some Republicans are hesitant about the name.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s judges’ candidates will normally be reviewed, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for the FBI's further clarification, Aaltola says it can still bring up something relevant.
Yes, it might.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inadequacy for office will still be discussed in a lively manner before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate with 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican Senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the nomination would be put to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman told BBC broadcaster that she identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photos, the woman said that it was a military reconnaissance in the GRU working for Anatoly Tshepiga.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported that they had exposed another of the suspected men to Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they found evidence that the men's current identities are covert identities.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the Russian-Chinese border to the Far East, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified the young Tshepiga from pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in British police photos featuring a man now calling himself Russa Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the nerve agent Novitshok in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the title of Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the alleged GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisonings said in an interview with Russian television earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as throwing bags in social welfare reform
A vivid example has now been given of what the most restrictive change in social welfare reform, as defined by the Sipilä Government, means in practice.
My municipality of birth Vaala’s social welfare services are produced by the Oulunkaare Joint Municipal Authority, whose health service director is the former regional director of Attendo.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the council of the change limitation.
If the spending on health and social services increases now, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were startled, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would end the institutional care of the health centre’s bed department and a small unit of memory patients.
Home health care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages will be torn from their roots next to the health centre - at home - to be treated.
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay for it.
The Vaala left did not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, carers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented the slides in the preparation of the health and social services sector, how the municipality of Vaala treats elderly people the most at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighboring councilman Carina Westinen.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it again lifted the Oulunkaari preparers to their hind legs.
Sote engineers do not write on any of the papers that Attendo has built a new care home in Vala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The rapporteurs talk only about service vouchers, but do not tell us what level of care it will receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until the hospice.
Without a nurse?
In other words, the health centre’s facilities are closed because there is no doctor’s night emergency services.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala’s example shows how central officials run delegates with incomplete information and delegates are put against the wall with a change limitation.
In this way, the Centre Party will empty Vaala’s inhabitants, because who stays there as insecure to live voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was there one election in the city centre to keep the whole country inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands of people protested when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened one of Europe’s largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River since morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany as having been successful and estimated to have strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the 2016 Turkish coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between the countries on human rights issues, among others.
Reviews surrounding the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit escalated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to an anti-Erdogan protest in Switzerland.
I want to be the voice of those who cannot go to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish-born.
In Slovakia, three accused of murder of journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
Prosecutors said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée from his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of cattle on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the printing fault, Karjalainen on Sunday will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution to shared boxes is required from memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday newspaper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Posting puts extra newspaper bundles in the province.
Newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will not be sent separately until Monday.
The distribution of these journals will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing directly today in his upcoming discussion programme, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip, which she booked for Virgin Galactic as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky test flight that took place in 2014 and even claimed the death of a man, things are right.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
The number of Vesa's flight is 300, which means that his journey takes place about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and in weightless mode we are 5 minutes at 100 km altitude, a Finnish astronaut tells us about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also backgroundizes his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book magazine called Space Travel and saw Star Trek series on televisions.
Star Wars has been seen, and that's what left the idea.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a very nice host.
Manchester City continued its undefeated course in the Premier League as it knocked out Brighton on its home field on Saturday with goals of 2-0.
The sixth victory of the reigning champion team was guaranteed by the goal sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season at close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute on the rear post of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he sawed with Sterling into pieces of the Brighton defense in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 final readings at the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City, which started the season, leads the Premier League with a catch of 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who has played less than one match, is stalking only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea on Saturday night in their own seventh-round match.
Youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu
At the meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term in 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme was elected as vice-president.
The council elected 40 members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Associations will announce on Sunday.
The youth conference was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year operational goals: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths,” says the Finnish Youth Society.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: “Losing a very important driver”
In an interview with Blick, a Swiss newspaper, Mersu's British driver was asked if he believes that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari services would help Hamilton in the remainder of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver, Sebastian Vettel, with 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen would not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his models.
I don’t know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
“I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy,” Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday with the Russian race.
From the pole position to the race starting at 2 p.m., Mercedes Valtteri Bottas leaves.
The evening newspaper follows the race moment by moment.
Football's A-young SM-series championship battle became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top level of the football boys will end on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the round began at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship battle were clear: FC Lahti Academy has enough to get a first place point in practice against Vasa IFK.
In order to reverse the situation in the final round, the second Ilves in the championship battle must win the PK-35 and wish for the loss of the bayers.
However, the Lahtin championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match from 16-0.
At the break, the bayers led to a 7-0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played partly for the same players in the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the Men's Division C.
Vasa IFK has played in the second half of the season against the fall.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in a guest match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on the roof in Eno - according to the rescue department, luck was involved
The passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof in Eno at 9 a.m. on Sunday.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue department reported.
Good luck, the statement said.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet from the rain.
A police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways of reconnaissance: Equipment procurements and recruitments already done, planning operations abroad will not be discussed
According to Antti Pelttar, the superintendent of the Supo, the Intelligence Act has been prepared for by making equipment purchases and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be entered in the budget of the Supo.
The premises of the Protection Police (supon) located on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already preparing for the full implementation of intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of the Supo Coalition, tells Lännen Media that equipment procurement has already been carried out for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams in a video of her singing in the topless campaign for awareness of breast cancer
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is back.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on his Instagram account, where he sings just his hands in front of his breasts, according to the news agency AFP.
The song is a 1991 Australian hit by The Divinyls I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
“I voiced The Divinyls’ worldwide hit to remind women to regularly do self-checking [breasts] — Williams writes in his Instagram post.
And yes, this placed me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it plays for many lives.
The second author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
“He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first,” Williams said.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams retired from the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a lot going on in the open tennis tournament in the United States three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the main judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men were accepted for much more violent behavior than women players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for height-photographers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant offers wonderful scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang Province, China.
It is literally located on the cliff.
If you want to, you can watch the forest.
The steep landscapes on high make restaurant visitors gasp their breath in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments ask where the restaurant’s bathroom is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the location is told.
This is the end of the race today: This is how it all ends.
All good things will end in time.
Today, this is what happens to the Finnish country drama Korpela’s alley run, which has been quite well-liked.
The third season has gone by like hot rocks: last week the episode was watched by 722,000 Finns as a premiere on television.
The peaks themselves have no practical significance anymore, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen are not going to continue.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirku’s relationship takes another big leap forward, and Jaska’s mother seems to be the first to guess what’s coming.
Even between Anssi and Miisa are warm, in the light of recent events romantic, but then Laiho appears again.
The police are also skeptical of the man.
However, no one knows the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets some incredible news.
The last will of the long distance is revealed, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
After a week, Sunday evenings will continue with new episodes of Sorjonen.
The Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 21:05.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a small cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people want to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth infecting others, as the disease can be contagious even if the symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says the Prevention release.
Is it worth staying home?
According to prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus infects you a day before the symptoms begin, and from then on, from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when your cough subsides and there’s no fever anymore,” says Dr. Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the gym slows recovery.
In addition, remember to wash your hands, throw the handkerchief and throw the rag papers in the trash.
Is it painful to move?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
You can’t put your fingers in your mouth or nose, Poland says.
It is also limited to masks.
How can infections be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15-30 seconds.
New Miss Finland repeats the Miss tradition: My husband is a hockey player
The ice hockey player and the missis are often linked together.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, a native of Pertunmaa, has received the 2018 Miss Finnish crown for her kuts.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Inkerinsuomalainen and her father is Russian.
Voronkov was bullied about his father's Russianism at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all,” Alina tells the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon she found new friends, and the day went on to roll as she wished.
When I was 15, I thought I was an adult, but I wasn’t.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans.
Since his career in the SM league, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of the dating, the couple lived almost a year in a remote relationship, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and with it I would have a career, I don’t want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust and the good thing about a remote relationship is that it keeps the spark alive all the time,” Alina grinned in May.
Constant growth with joy, death on our feet
Almost everyone is concerned about the Earth’s resilience.
Yet, there is nothing to give up.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continuous growth, but even the theory of the moderate economy runs into big problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that could only be dreamed of in the past.
However, the long-standing overstepping of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are causing this market economy’s stone feet to waver in a threatening manner.
Two men were stabbed on the night of Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at four o'clock in the morning.
Born in 1986, the man was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second, born in 1968, was milder.
The older men have already left the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible contribution to the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
The events are being investigated as a attempted killing and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's key point - Inter's coach lamented the error
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match ending at 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through from the right side and happily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the guest game, the Mariehamns reached two points in the Turku Ball Club.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized by Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
However, Lundberg stated that the team did not engage in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening season, but luckily the goal of the Turku people brought us more strongly into the game.
John Allen, head coach for home team Inter, said the game was under control, but scoring was painful again.
One defense error took away a full score pot from us, Allen lamented.
Again we were the best!

Lehterä showed his underpower skills, the place of play is not yet sure
Jori Lehtera's strong underpower play emerged when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice match before the season began.
Philadelphia defeated Boston 4-1, and Lehdeä pitched Michael Rafflin twice to score.

I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of it.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
“I think I’m ready for the NHL,” she said in an interview posted on Boston’s Twitter account.
In the riverboys, the Libra woman, who had her puck doctrine, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.

New picture shows change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, undergoes a striking transformation.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed 200 kilos at its highest.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Hall admitted before winning the title that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the victory of the world's strongest man race by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he had the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and was no longer seen at the April 2018 World's Strongest Man Games.
Hall recently posted a photo on Instagram, where he poses in a much slimmer condition than his active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he is currently training five times a week aerobically.
The programme includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
Hall also does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year the strongest man in the world was the Icelandic, also known from the Game of Thrones TV series Hafźór Júlíus Björnsson.
The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurantship M/S Tampere stormed the ground in Pyhäjärvi -- Closed with stones
Inland watership M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday night in Akaa Lake Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue service received an alert for a water traffic accident on Friday night after half past twelve.
The 30-metre-long vessel M/S Tampere has run aground, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rocks,” said Matti Willman, an on-call firefighter.
The ship had 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the Rescue Department, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere, said on-call chief Jari Nieminen to STT after 1 p.m. at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusean Strait.
Police are investigating the cause of the incident.
On-call firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult due to the darkness and rather hard wind.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, divers begin to check the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant ship with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
The ship also has a meeting room for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-Managers Ask Robert Helenius for Unpaid Fees
Boxer Robert Helenius' evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkila, where Helenius and his late interest are charged with a total of over EUR 80,000 in unpaid manager fees.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mandate, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomit.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent an equivalent to Iltalehti, telling the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the required amount.
In return, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services to Helenius in an economically difficult situation and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It had been agreed verbally that Helenius was obliged to pay commissions only in percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius had nothing to pay, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also normal and the only practice in the management of professional athletes.
Salary work has never been agreed upon, and it would have been absurd in Helenius’ situation, Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the answer, Helenius would have liked to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft done until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was bad for himself and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once when dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned a non-individual but substantial invoice for the manager’s work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila’s post-operative activities cowardly, says the counterpart.
Helenius meets today at the Stuttgart of Erkan Teper, the seventh on the IBF heavyweight challenger list.
A hearty man and a good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka-Ile Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The obituary of the host was published in Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The report reports that Pälli died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio at the time, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of the acquaintance.
He said goodbye on Facebook, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers Pälli was a well-liked person with quick hookers and funny things.
I got to know Erik already as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouseman.
That's when Erik and I met.
He was then a spokesperson for Finnlevy and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular reporter at all the parties to do stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw the great fire he had on entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviewees.
He was a good man and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar as a respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote brilliant newspaper articles.
Eric interviewed me several times.
He was very good at talking, he said.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Fazer label Toivo Kärje in addition to supplier work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, Päll’s greatest passion was radio work, in which he had a distinctive style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The union describes the experience of its economic situation — a full translation — although the economy is certainly burdened — by significant debt in the balance sheet —
Mika Kulmala, Executive Director, praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
Last autumn we reacted to the situation as quickly as possible, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and economic management have been built throughout our organisation, Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also been successful in partner procurement and the world cup yield was also maximum in the past competitive period.
However, even in the future, cost management needs to be precise, and at the same time we need to constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital's backyard in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors are assembled to assess injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to aftershocks.
One of the people in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and she's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm, lay in the courtyard of the army hospital in Palu.
At the start of the quake, he was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the Paluu wedding party.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
\"I hope they're safe,\" Haris told AP.
Small shops are being looted
In the Palu evacuation center, Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods as tight in the city.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being looted everywhere, says Kusuma.
Many people in Palu have slept outside or in temporary bamboos.
Even if the house were somehow standing, possible aftershocks could destroy it for good and bury the residents under them.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners reportedly, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after guards had told them not to go looking for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first, an army C-130 transport aircraft landed on the field, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land in the field without air traffic control assistance, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by an earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
A long rain zone is spreading across the country on the night of Sunday, according to the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly in water, but in central and northern Lapland it is expected to sleet or snow.
The frosts of the night before are not recurring because under the cloud cover temperatures remain higher.
A more cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures under control quite effectively.
It is possible to visit the cold in the west for a moment,” said Ville Ilkka, an on-call meteorologist.
On Sunday, the rainforest retreats towards the east during the morning.
In the south and west there are pout or semi-clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees Celsius.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in place in marine areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise the weather will vary from typical autumn to autumn.
It’s going to be a good year for me now,” Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland Final will not be seen on TV
IL-TV lets you watch the red carpet glamour and sparkle of the Miss Finland competition.
Iltalehti's entertainment editors pull live broadcast on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from the Billnäs Rugs.
The transmission starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday from among ten finalists.
The 2018 Miss Finland final will be held at the Billnäs Ruukki in Rasepori.
Before starting the final, you will be able to watch the atmosphere from the spot on IL-TV live.
Live broadcast starts around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a lot of previous Miss Finland winners have been invited to the final.
In the jury they are represented by the 1998 Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus.
Other jury representatives include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jouni Store Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seikka news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd get to college before he went to the Missus Games.
Russian father Dimitri and mother Svetlana believed in their daughter’s success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter's first moments at the crown's end.
They snuck into the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the show we started to get nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived in Finland her entire childhood.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should be starting to miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina got excited about the beauty competitions.
The parents wanted Alina to go to university before attending the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina still wanted to do her bachelor's degree before the Missus Games.
We already asked him last year why he didn't attend, but he wanted to finish the candi.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of exercise and eats healthy.
Alina likes to be present, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri works as a hockey player in Japan, and did not get to Finland to encourage her love in the finale.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts for a year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents were hoping that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long time since I've been to visit you because of the missis.
I miss you even though you have posted messages.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - I thought about the idea of a comic book: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
My husband’s statement, in which he proposed it to me, was one of the origins of my story,” says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger from Espoo, Finland, and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo said that she had been an EU translator in Brussels for economic and legal matters until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I enjoyed being a housewife very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought about what I would do when I was a kid when I was a kid.
In 2014, a comic book came into the picture.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tint and Asterix from a young age.
I had been drawing since I was a child, but when these manuscripts were born, things changed.
At first, I made dozens of manuscripts in a desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled illustrator, but I could not attract her until the summer of 2016 when I gave Viivi with the help of an inscription.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing Piippo, who tells him that the record was a great encourager for him.
The circuit board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
On paper, I didn’t even try to draw, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
The scripts pop into the mind all the time, but I usually don’t prepare at once.
It will take up to several hours for a three-screen strip.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest, because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates Dilbert by Scott Adams, among others.
The characters in the organic hunk are a carrot-bodyed mother with a salad-haired soft.
The other characters are Man, Pissis, and Twins.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a coercive bun, even though the Organic Hoop is sometimes intruding.
Piippo says he will read his series with his husband and children.
It’s such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you’ve drawn and say that this is what I’ve done today.
There are enough challenges for a housewife.

Another €20,000 win goes to Vantaa S-Market Tikkurila for the winner who played with the Veikkaus card.
One was caught by an online player from Vaasa.
Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
Indonesia’s 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawa Agung has become the hero of the earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people off an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the town of Palu when an earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to steer Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway to the air.
In this way, he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The flight control tower shook and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation official told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify as the flight reached the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn said that Europe would end up in a trade war: “We have to look at the following tweet.”
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in Yle's first morning that while the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in corporate investment decisions.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Rehn believes that Europe is a very busy country.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding into the feet of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and review it afterwards.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted sharply to the clearly deficited budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday night.
Next year’s deficit will be over 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credit and over ten per cent is unstructured credit.
In addition, its public finances are at a disadvantage and the country seems to once again exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when he was asked if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in agreement.
The difference would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year.
The debate over his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has been flashed in speeches.
It doesn’t matter if there are Finnish names involved,” Rehn said, adding that he is not going to comment further.
HS’s super-popular Black Box shows will resume next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the coming week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on 2nd, 8th and 11th October.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre for sale.
The Tampere presentation is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on stage will tell a long-prepared true story that has not been published on any HS instrument before.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
“There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the world, and a talkative story about a very topical health issue,” says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing live journalism nights for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the audience.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier Gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The award winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to get close to their readers.
The spring 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The show will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The presentation at that time has a different content than it did in this autumn evenings.
The missing sponge inhibitor was found — thanks to an unprejudiced experiment —
The Finnish police’s drone expertise is among the top in the world:
According to the headmaster of the Police University of Applied Sciences, the police can use the drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in crime scene investigation and intelligence tasks.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom inhibitor in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, Rector of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the incident and mentioned, among other things, that, through an unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also at the top of the world here.
The Drone is quite a new thing and even more recent in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been achieved, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a great deal of interest elsewhere,” Himberg said.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone action of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Increasingly Generalized
Himberg points out that finding lost in Finland’s winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Hundreds of drone pilots have already been trained by the Finnish police.
According to Himberg, they are to be trained more.
Already now, drones are used in police duties a lot, and their use will become more common and increasing in the future.
That’s what I’d like to say, Himberg said.
In addition to the search for the missing, the police may use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and in certain types of reconnaissance tasks.
For example, we need to go a little further to check out an area where there may be a fear of violence.
Drone can then be used for pre-registration.
Karelian Rugby
Karelian Rugby celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and porched the Southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd Division championship knew the historical rise of Karelian Rugby to Division 1.
Previously, the club has played in number one, but at the time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club is going to take a place in the series, but it will know quite a job next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game trips, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Head coach Claude Julien of the Montreal Canadiens, playing hockey in the NHL, confirmed the club's Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesper Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super pledge in the first round of Kotkaniemi, 18, number three at the summer reservation event.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has presented strong extracts in September's practice matches.
In his first training match, Kotkaniemi managed to score.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish as having taken major development steps after arriving at the camp.
The NHL regular season will begin on the night of Thursday.
Montreal meets the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
A lot has been said about leadership this week.
Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa told in an interview with HS about his book Paranoid optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have also talked about leaders' inability to act as a team; fear and unspokenness, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
Risk-taking and agility in the company's upsurge disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki, which drew the cream of Finnish business to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 stars from the world of business rose to the stage.
Talking about good leadership was enough.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management, said that a good leader must dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a wide range of organic products, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff about the company’s purpose.
And that cannot be just a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are researched to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly, and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the life cycle phase of the company.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
The Nordic Business Forum listened to these lessons with 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of information.
It takes a lot from a good leader.
This is why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There was also a pool and a pool.
They talked to each other in a friendly way.
However, they did not wonder if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
Their humility was not easy to judge from the outside.
Sara Chafak arrives on a red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spending most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also had a lace-plated dress.
A little poden jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's in L.A. for auditions.
Among other things, he has done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, he says that the work needs to be done even harder, because there is always a replacement for the work of the model.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors wins €30,000 live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works on choreography, community activism and teaching.

His work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously intervened in, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group operating in the field of live art.
The Danish police found a Volvo in a major operation: \"We can't tell you where -
Extensive searches by the Danish police have yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic had been closed on the bridges of Öresund and Iso-Belt.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Själlan was closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
Is reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
We've found the car we're looking for.
“We can’t tell you where the car was found,” Henrik Storm of the Copenhagen Police Department told Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo does not have a direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Danish Extra Bladet reported a police briefing on Saturday.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent on the course of the operation.
He didn't want to tell us what crime was being investigated.
However, Skov said that this was a serious crime.
It was a threat to the lives of people.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
Police will not tell you if they have already been arrested.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also watched the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public has no more cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of dissension - now the people vote on it in controversial elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement of the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of North Macedonia would be called the Republic of Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's efforts to join NATO and the EU with its veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate supports Macedonian membership of the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at the school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted for the school, asked for support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This is a change for young people in particular, he said.
In 1991, the Republic of Macedonia was officially designated as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough tension as to whether the voter turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of the parliament is needed to change the constitution.
The agreement must also be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at eight o’clock in Finland.
That's a handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocks out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to fight in harder positions than seen on Saturday, which are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius finished the match in the eighth round, when he knocked out Teper with his hard left hand punch.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
“Nordic Nightmare hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight as early as December 2015.
Teper then pleaded for injury and withdrew from the match.
Then it turned out that the German had been incinerated twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken 28 games from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton to win 50 points
The Formula One championship title was approaching its confirmation again, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup point lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel already to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five games left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position of the race, drove second.
Last year in Sochi, Bottas, who won the opening victory of his career, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who started the last line of departure, was fifth.
The duo assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu, caught at the end of the block
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also intercepted the victim's phone.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with a haystack and a 39-year-old man in Ilomantsi, a block away shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of the electric car company Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the U.S. authorities.
Musk has also been fined $20 million for his tweets that he had secured funding to pull Tesla out of the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights time to reach peace with the United States on Nafta
Time threatens to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada over a free trade agreement with Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and negotiators have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (FTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to put the deal into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow enough time for the Congress of the United States to evaluate it.
Neighbours thought candles would be a fire in Kaakkuri - fire department was alerted to the scene
The candles burned in the apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were alerted to the scene due to a possible fire in the apartment building.
On the spot, it was discovered that the candles burning in the sauna in the apartment building had looked like a fire to the opposite house, which was why the matter had been reported to the emergency centre.
There was no fire in the target.
Police arrested 11 people after a Honka-HJK match - brawling on the ground and at the metro station
Eleven people were arrested by police on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match in the men's football league played in Espoo, police commissioner Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was protection from crime and disorder.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
Earlier, they were told by the night-saids.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the field from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to squealing and fistfights between team supporters.
In order to end the situation, horsemen were needed, among other things.
In addition to the field, the rioting took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn’t there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen pointed to the rioting in the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
Table stone hastened its butterfly swimming season in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have advanced to the finals on World Swimming Cup 3/7 final day in the Netherlands.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS' Tablestone shook Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was second in the opening rounds at 22,82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki during the SE-time of the trip 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espoo-based Cetus, was the 24th time of butterfly bathing 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was in the early stages of the 50-metre breaststroke in the sixth time 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the beginnings of the two hundred meters of confusion, Laukkanen was 15th at 2.14,25.
Students play a rare treat: the ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuality
Tragedys in ancient times are a rare treat on Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen the ancient tragedy of Sofokleen Philoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought the only complete play trilogy of Antiquity, the Oresteia of Aeschylus, to the tour starting from the National Theatre.
In the Stages Open! projects launched in 2015, the Theatre Academy’s acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of this fourth project, as well as the first.
The international premiere of Oresteia took place in Berlin in April.
Roiha's Atonement of Orestea summarizes the story of the end of the blood vengeance of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law for an hour to twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choir portions.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsaura’s fine Finnish version (2003).
Dramatic lights and a presentation revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasize a simplified and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between performers who break out of the choir and performers who play title roles.
The show uses both double and triple scenes for name roles.
The actors do not leave the scene at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Trojan War, and his capture of the war, Kassandra, are also shown on the stage, unlike the tradition of ancient performances.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created in front of the viewer’s eyes, constantly aware of its ritualistic roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out the rhythmic group of acting students in the master stage as a close group, even as a single organism.
In choir sections, in particular, actors who bend to very expressive, sculptural group formations are able to get their rights on the naked, only by decorating the white curtain, on the stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia’s performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new product is beginning to be visible in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and H2 Energy in Switzerland.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the Hannover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a new model of a thousand cars for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai will continue to operate on the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles by the Nexo and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this kind of first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network,” said In Cheol Lee, Vice President, Hyundai Motor.
Several times, the fists flew in Kajaani.
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and off it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit a man inside the restaurant, as a result of which he was removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser struck him as well.
Police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
He was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is investigated as three assaults and violent opposition from the official.
In the centre of Kajaani, there was also another incident of abuse in Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who beat him before kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and police called.
However, the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police ask witnesses to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainuu@polipoliti.fi.
Long line radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, a long-time journalist at Yle, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
We're on our way.
The doctor told me, “I’m living one day at a time,” he told the newspaper a month ago.
The safety of the store’s aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When you’re surprised by something this year, it’s usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and, for a moment, even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, working environment expert at the Finnish Service Industries Trade Union (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious will be reported to the police and many actual cases of violence will remain unreported.
“Companies are, of course, obliged to record their near miss situation on the basis of the Occupational Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and are not collected anywhere,” he said.
Mental injuries do not end with statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always cause physical injuries.
However, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw from when a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their job, even if the real thing doesn’t happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got security.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, there was also a pretty big steam in the media about its impact on the safety of the sellers.
“At that time, quite a few employers arranged security services for at least night-time hours and to prevent working alone,” Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this produces a new negative trend.
When security kept the disturbances well under control, the impression emerged that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been assaulted does not want to make an investigation request about a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But under the same provision of the law, enacted in 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle of the store is assaulted, the police should be investigated and the prosecutor prosecuted.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery store must be open almost night and day must guarantee the safety of its employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast -- Sara, Iiro is then married --
The coronation of Miss is not seen in traditional TV this year, but the broadcast is shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
Backstage and red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives that the broadcast was taking place.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a fresh applause.
Now all the women scream!
Take a look at this male host, Sohlberg gleamed his colleagues as the crowd cheered.
Many of the games are followed by Miss Finland from previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side, and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg slid looking at the Saros.
Most likely, Sohlberg, by his throw, referred to the newly divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, although at first he seemed confused.
Sieppi spoke of his resignation for the first time in the weekend newspaper of the Evening Messages.
Missikaunottar said she does not want to open the reasons for the divorce more clearly in public, as it is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he's not in a hurry for a new relationship, but he's going to focus on himself.
I’m focusing on my own things, and especially I’m starting to live my own life alone,” Sara Sieppi said.
The marriage status of Harjula came to light even later when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, wasn't he?
Janni Hussi signed up for the screw-up.
Pohjalainen man tortured tied to his common-law spouse by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for a number of crimes against his common-law spouse for three years in prison.
The crime-making tool included a belt, cable, and cable ties.
The court ruled that these items were lost to the state.
He was charged with alleged aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
The Kokkolan was charged with four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two acts of harm.
The crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the action, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivations of liberty and of aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was filed in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public record of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By its judgment, the court ordered the state to dispose of criminal means: belt and cable, bundle ties, bathrobe belt, knife and vestur.
Four witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It is clear from the sentence that a large part of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in the court.
The 34-year-old must pay the victim a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm.
He does not have that money, for the condemned already have debts in the collection.
Penalty is not a man’s first.
The evening newspaper does not state the name of the convicted person in order to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district sentence is not valid when writing this.
Europe leads four-point lead to Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their lead in a traditional hole-playing match against the United States.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup outside Paris with 10-6 points, while twelve doubles games will still be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball matches that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon four-ball, the wins were equalized 2-2.
The European lead stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played in Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had ever achieved this.
On Sunday, the two seek more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans has won more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the fierce harassment of its supporters in the Honka match: \"Violence is not part of football\"
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruption behavior of its supporters in Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
“We apologise for the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters,” the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 supporters of HJK rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The organizers did not calm the situation, but police officers and also cavalry officers were needed.
In a statement, HJK said that the team's players and staff were shocked by the incident.
The events following the match are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old club.
“We are firmly disengaging from any action that endangers the safety of match events,” the statement said.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers to identify factors that threaten safety and eliminate mild phenomena.
Proponent culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football stands in every way.
“Violence is not part of it,” the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies drone car - thus avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some sort of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group around the world that vows to have invented a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, he has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flagged his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will provoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates that the industrial action to begin tomorrow will be reflected in day care and social and health services for children
In the public and well-being sectors, the prohibitions on overtime and change of shifts will be visible in social and health services and day care for children, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of the JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in the way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to wonder how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services are playing and that no one’s life is threatened,” Niemi-Laine says.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shifts due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, that the staff has not been hired, but that the employees have remained in overtime or changed shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is the norm to take care of regular working hours for each employee and to do them only.
JHL opposes the Government’s intention to reduce the protection against dismissal of small enterprises.
Markku Jalonen, the labour market leader of municipal employers, does not begin to assess the effects of overtime and shift change bans in advance.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what can be done.
The area is so vast, social and health services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer,” Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experiences of the similar three-day activities of the Association of Local and Basic Nurses Super and the Social and Health Professional Association Tehy.
Their effects were quite limited.
The JHL’s overtime and shift change ban applies to, for example, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial struggle affects almost 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL’s actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the drafting of the dismissal act continues.
The government should now admit that this is a run on the wall and hard.
Both the Ay movement and the government must stand up.
It is strange that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
A large coral reef is created by children and adults - in the exercise circles of the performance, the gestures of a ray and a seahorse are studied
The Great Coral Reef was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group’s previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a more clear-cut presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is plenty of magic for children too.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The Great Coral Reef, however, is not a children’s performance but a performance that adults and children collaborate on.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint play also reduces the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef is somewhat like a saddle ballet, a fitness circuit and a nature-themed awareness strike, but it finally tunes around visits in different, non-human states.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the business lines of corals, as well as organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
Six different fitness districts teach, among other things, the gestures of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour in which music, lights and glossy paints and costumes help to get to know the life of the coral reef.
The large Coral Reef is home to both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being looked at.
They are also coral-watching organisms.
Eyes and observations in many directions make the presentation dense and life-scattering.
Whether you are a landscape of an organism, an organism looking at a landscape, or another organism or landscape looking at an organism - and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn’t seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and action, which is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
However, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
Destruction beyond man’s understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it might be difficult to comprehend the significance of practicing one’s compassion in the face of the visions of destruction.
Other spaces have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, there are other species, and there are future generations of those whose wonder and play it will clear up.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today’s children and young people are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because others say they do.
I was stunned when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister over the weekend — a boyfriend.
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn’t possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we’ve been told and warned throughout our childhood that you shouldn’t touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today’s children could live a decent childhood, and they wouldn’t have to grow up too early due to group pressure created by friends.
I’m constantly seeing younger girls on Instagram who have makeup on their faces and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing images.
It's getting harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am glad there were no smart phones in my childhood.
I got to be a child for many years and didn’t have to think about what others think of me.
Officials tell government that Airiston Helmi's case is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Protection Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that Airisto’s Helmi investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reports.
The information on sources that appeared anonymously was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva (kok) Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were very strict about not speculating that there was anything else in this,” Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to YLE data, no evidence of the material seized has been found so far on the connection to national security, but the investigation is still under way.
There is no way to know what can be revealed, one of the interviewees says.
Extensive home searches started a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere financial crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week, the newspaper compiled a story that goes through arguments both for and against.
Video: The dream goal saved a series lost by Liverpool
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to a close, but it was still a more satisfied team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to a 1-0 guest win.
Then Pep Guardila's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and, in particular, Virgil van Dijk seemed to dominate alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league cup guest win below Wednesday from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a fantastic individual performance.
Hazard, of course, was there from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small space with the triangular game Mateo Kovacic and Jorgenho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard plunge forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass through.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but bombed a complete left leg pull from there to the lower corner.
Pool brass watchman Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and only got his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's steering from the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea Veskari Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's pull and pushed the ball from the base of the pole into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, with his zeros, threw Hazard through.
The best place for guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brass star's bulldozer turned towards national teammate David Luiz, who saved the masters' lead.
It didn't last for the 89th minute, either, when changeman Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot for 25 metres.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed in honor of it an irresistible bet on the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still on the league top - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship battle with two points behind the tip.
In the clock shift conversation, the pots are deep
I remember a few decades ago, a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow’s answer was the only one: the Nen terminal.
Some have a nen ending in their last name and some don't.
I mean, the distribution lines can be created anywhere, and here's one serving.
Finland has achieved that the annual clock shift is being abandoned in the EU.
Very many people agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused a wide variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing to do now is to decide what time of day will end up in the end: in the current summer or winter time or in some other time zone.
You can also say your opinion on the Otakanta.fi page.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
The debate is intense on coffee tables and social media, and everyone has their word to say.
Those who defend the winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people’s well-being and those who defend summer time by the influence of evening light on people’s desire for outdoor activities and thus well-being.
Both have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that morning light is rhythmizing a person’s day and giving them vitality.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases people’s movement outside and provides better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I’d rather have both, but bad for our location in the northern part of the earth, we can’t do anything.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many people anyway.
A typical discussion on the subject is that one’s own vision is pursued and the other’s view is strongly opposed.
You don’t listen to the arguments of the other side, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn one’s head.
It's burning gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate because it does not require a great deal of effort and there is enough mud feeling to justify it.
Similar issues are usually the most acute and equally fruitless.
It will be a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but it will also be adapted.
And it always provides a suitable scapegoat if life feels sad.
Josba fought for a narrow guest win
Josba's first away game at the Divar in the hallbandy produced a full three-series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba went home from Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time, the 50.47 brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5-winning goal.
As both teams were penalized, decisive minutes were played on the equalizer.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepower anyway, when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next meeting will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow in some very sad moods.
The burning of the Church of Excitement a week ago was a shock.
The church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we move to the parish house at the Karelian banquet table.
There are all kinds of things in and out of the program throughout the day.
For example, you can visit the church building with the guidance of the retired Ari Räsänen, who has been a parish master for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
Already decommissioned, the parish house built in 1982 keeps its doors open today for the last time.
We are now in the evasive premises of the former municipal hall, says Kappalainen Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for that 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as head of the Tesla government's speech - Fraud charges agreed for $40 million
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC of the US Securities Regulatory Authority.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being set aside for the company he founded.
Musk, however, is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Musk, however, has to step down from the seat of Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company has to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk is also under tighter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and monitor Musk’s communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to mediate the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disruptions and harm to Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peikin, Director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company’s funding was secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with other management or potential financiers of the company.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk and the company.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from acting in the management of listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went into a strong decline.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The number of deaths from the Indonesian earthquake and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency, according to the AFP news agency.
The number of deaths is still expected to increase, as the destruction is still being investigated.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could reach thousands.
On Friday, an earthquake raised a tsunami that plunged into the town of Palu, on the island of Sulawesi.
Immediately after the quake, a warning was issued about the tsunami, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known dead are, at least for the time being, Palalus.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to have died.
Ruins of requests for help
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescue workers to find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the extermination area today, urged soldiers to continue their rescue efforts tirelessly day and night.
One of the rescue efforts is a hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the emergency services agency, said that one person was exhumed at night from the ruins of the Roa-Roa hotel, which was favored by business travelers.
We also heard people’s requests for help, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy grubbing equipment would quickly be needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Please help me, Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one of the authors pleaded in the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to deficiencies in the app's encryption.
Interferences were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of ministers.
This was an application used at the Conservative Party Party Congress in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, the Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, the former Secretary of State, were harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the application, the public was able to access the politicians' profiles in the mobile application of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public had access to profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
The person who logged in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
For a moment, someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile picture into a pornographic picture and title into a slanderous one.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, columnist at The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to sign in to other people’s profiles with their email addresses.
Then you can view the profile person’s contact details and send messages in their name.
The meeting application made every journalist, politician and participant’s phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative Party spokesperson apologized for the leak.
He said the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The UK Information Agency (ICO) is supporting the data breach.
The application was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, there is a large crowd of clapping Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland quiz.
Eye-catching viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland quiz show.
The American format The Wall, which is rapidly spreading around the world, landed on the Finnish version of Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been shot in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, the possibilities for filming were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high game wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, a studio audience of the program was raised on social media, which was speculated to be Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether the Poles in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
The head of the four domestic programmes, Unne Sormunen, sheds light on the matter to the Evening Press.
He says that the studio audience includes close players, other Finns, Finns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international applause in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes that are filmed in the same production space in other countries.
Even in Finland, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to various programmes, Sormunen backgrounds.
He points out that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if one does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls fall from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for foreign-language speakers who will take care of the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the studio director as a simultan interpretation of events all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of flap they’re throwing at, for example, and what the situation is going on,” Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was recently delivered in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was part of Talent Finland’s filming in Finland a few years ago.
Simultaneous interpretation came to him all the time and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the filming, Sormunen sums up.
Typhoon in Japan's southern parts is heading towards the main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Tram, but officials say that major injuries have been avoided and there are currently no reports of casualties.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK public radio company, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in some places stalled because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around half a day in Finnish time.
The capital city of Tokyo is not directly on the route of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to regulators, Trami torments Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces is getting darker.
The first season of the Aces has been bad.
The sky became almost black as the team lost to Vaasan Sport on Saturday at 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points for six rounds.
No defender of Aces or two lower chain players have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
At the time of the game, the audience disappeared from the hall when the game was almost half over.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to be worried because we played so hard.
In particular, the performance of the second round was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made 1+2 for Ässi, said.
Sport, of course, enjoyed the win.
The team had a game below from Friday, so it would have been seen in the making.
I may have seen it, but I didn’t know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders about the audience of the event in the grand hall.
I thought maybe this year there won’t be so many people in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Tractor Competition was held at the same time as the Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it happened; the hallways were already clogged before 10 a.m., the sellers reported that the products had run out, more news porridge was sold for almost 500 servings, and Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
In the five hours of the morning and afternoon, there was a special program for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Salesmen also flock to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, almost a hundred of the rapporteurs, the sellers of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
The children’s bread competition included 11 different types of bread.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent a day at the Martian pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right mood for the interior and read the book without tired eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes.
The importance of lighting is increasing the more years behind it.
Adequate light can help with the problems that many people experience with age, as vision accuracy decreases and more and more people suffer from glare.
As a parent, the need for light also increases.
A person in their 60s needs light three times more than a person in their 20s.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the effects of light and the properties of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi tip.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The current designer can afford to choose.
The favourite is the Japanese style that combines gestureless, Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style inspired by the 1970s, with strong colors, metal with different shades or ice cream colors, has also risen to boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as other interiors in the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more is invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, bold luminaire that has a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, whose origins and designers are known.
So let’s be very design conscious, says Jokiniemi.
The home does not necessarily have the latest trend light, but a timeless classic, for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics hold their own year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo shows door to Canadian attacker after three games
Koo Koon and attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads are breaking apart.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games without power points in the orange blacks, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old striker played for the KHL for Kunlund Red Star and and for the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new company is not yet known.
Gameman wants to set an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic is changed to paper
Today, Gameman recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of stonefoot shop customers are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packages from importers.
All packages that come to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes ten times as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used,” says Ville Puurula of Oulun Pelimies.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we will be moving to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling does not cause extra effort.
It’s not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for the player’s operations, as alongside new products, the store’s key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work as a costume from one season to the next.
With their versatility, they create the foundation of a good garderob, as it is easy to assemble different kinds of outfits around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
Made of natural material, black knitted polo collars cannot have a mistake purchase.
The clothing can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirt and jeans, and around it you can create both a discreet outfit and a snotty style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look comes from golden brown and wide-tailed corduroy pants, black polo knits and grey ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, a blue-green Scots-screen skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring an edge to a black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy clothing: jeans, high boots and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU had abandoned this policy.
During the Soviet era, sabotage activities were specialized in the so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from the Russian words diversiono-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and reconnaissance group.
Agents of the Soviet Security Service in the West of the KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says the archivist Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004), who defected to the west of the KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for DRG groups uniforms and accessories for the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and road workers for covert operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
In the Cold War, agents hid supplies for sabotage groups in the terrain with mines, explosives, detonators, and communications equipment.
Still in 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, which was detonated when it was sprayed with a water cannon by the authorities.
Police found four drunk drivers in the province last night.
Police arrested four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old Contiolahti man blew 1,57 per mil.
At 4:30 a.m., he drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanints.
On Kuorevaarantie, Kneejärvi, the car crashed into a ditch at 4 a.m., and a 19-year-old local man alone in the car blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him in the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old out-of-town man blew 1.33 per mil into the alcometer.
The police suspect these male drivers of aggravated drunk driving and the driver of Lake Polvijärvi, in addition to endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning in Tuupovaara, at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van blew 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are asking for observations of the stabbing at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was beaten in a parking lot off the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on a security camera.
Dark-haired suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige coat immediately after the stabbing took a dark station wagon to Ratapihankatu in the direction of the bus station.
One suspect took a bicycle to Humalistonkatu in the direction of the city centre.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus collided with him.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. in Rauma in Niittumaa.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Mika Toivola, HPK sports director at Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (the middle) has been important to the team in starting, underpower playing and the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played early autumn in the trial period, will continue in the HPK of Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club leadership.
Philip has been an important piece for us in startups, underpower play and the defensive role of field four.
Even though there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to the experienced player,” said Mika Toivola, HPK’s sports director.
According to Toivola, the value of risk increases when playing the ice hockey league's solution games.
Riska, a central striker from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
On the other hand, the winger Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the trial period.
Real story on TV today: The climber was left dead twice
Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experience.
Tonight’s movie was based on it.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish television.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 guidance is about a survival battle that has been dealt with extensively.
There have been films - and documents - about the tragedy in the past.
Real events are also going on in this case.
The tallest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery performed before leaving Nepal.
As a result of it and air pressure, he lost his sight, which was why the conquest of the summit had to be ignored.
Rob Hall went on and didn't come back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to the camp.
When the man was found, he was found in such poor condition that he was not believed in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
It was like a miracle that he got on his feet and found the others.
The badly frozen Weathers were thought to still be dying and once again he was left to his own fate.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old church.
The 200-year-old church was celebrated today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday to mark the anniversary.
The feast began at 10 a.m. at Eno Church Hill at the family fair, after which a Karelian banquet table has been offered at the Eno Parish House.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family messu.
The pastor of Eno, Armi Rautavuori, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time and give strength to the work, says Iron Mountain (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Passion danger, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
The Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after the Church of Kiihtelysvaara was destroyed in the fire.
The wooden church of Kiitelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotional service was held to silence and commemorate the church destroyed in the fire.
Images and videos: Medican flashes its power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A strong hurricane-type autumn storm surged Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Photos taken from the area show plenty of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how between houses in the city of Kiato, Corinthia, has suddenly appeared instead of the street due to river flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese Peninsula, strong wind caused strong seafaring.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The Delegation calls for the monitoring of weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, carries heavy rains and even a flood risk.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, there are only one or two medicans per year worldwide, typically around September and October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now blowing left flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been caused by refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper shelter.
Also under the storm are areas destroyed by wildfires around Athens in the summer.
In Greece, the Medica was also rampant last November.
We should not go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Expeditions to the sea are cancelled and while walking you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk stuff on top of the storm.
Guides like these have been distributed to more than 3,500 Finns on holiday through Aurinkomatkat.
Instructions are needed, as even the storm Zorbas, which is rising in horror readings, has been predicted to beat the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise in gusts up to 45 metres per second.
The weather is enhanced by heavy rains.
All those travelling to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui, who have provided their phone number, have been warned about the harsh winds by SMS.
Still in the air sun and heat
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on the communication of solar tours, by early Saturday evening, the resorts have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to normal schedule.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
Safety is ahead of us.
Antonia Schroderus, a media spokesperson for Tui, says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in touch with our staff.
At least Crete was still calm, he told Saturday early evening.
Tui has a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had a glimpse of the sun and the temperature reached 27 degrees,” says Ikonen.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next trouble in Turkey, although slightly relieved.
In case of this, we have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and have checked, for example, the number of Finns who flew to Antalya with Tui,” Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvisella and Janni Hussi have identical evening dresses in the missi finale - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful dress for this evening.
Exactly the same silver evening dress was also chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two of them also noticed their similar outfits and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on a plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet host in the missi final, and he chats with the front row stars arriving.
Hussi has recently moved to Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday.
I’m going to stay there now, let’s see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own study room, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful,” Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - gathered curious glances of pensioners
Host and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirley Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final she had had enough to do with radio plots and Love Island Finland shootings.
There has been enough haste even to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the finals directly from Finnair’s flight.
I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
I change my clothes at home, I laugh.
He said he was wearing his makeup in the middle of retirement.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was fun, at least for others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
At Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his washed as a host of Love Island Finland.
So far, his experience has also been stopping.
Karvinen says he went to see the singles on Friday.
In some ways, it's really raw.
They are the true feelings of people, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles on the show.
How do I wear oversized boots?
Three perfect examples
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that function from one season to the next in costume.
Classics are often decades old, but sometimes they can accommodate even more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the over-generation boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
As its name suggests, boots that reach over the knee repeat themselves elegantly from year to season.
Displaying boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - bravely.
In fact, oversized boots are suitable for any type of outfit.
Whether it's jeans, lace, tulle or jersey, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
The long boots look good both in the festive look and in everyday outfits.
Black oversized boots fit well even in hemp outfits.
They appropriately balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plier skirt and a hempy, puffy knit.
A fresh but autumn-style casual outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit comes from a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-generation boots, spectacular earrings and a staple small bag.
Although the oversized boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for a relaxed casual outfit, along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
It is so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, the City of Espoo informs.
Otaniemi’s robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring a robotic bus will be launched in the area.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment reveals how robotic cars perform on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment,” says traffic management manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robot cars run completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always ensured by an auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several sensors and assessing whether the road is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the vehicle, bicycle or snowflake is detected, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 13-15.30, Wednesdays at 10-15 and Thursdays at 10-15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The stops of robot cars are recognized by stop markings.
The most secure way to get to the bus stop at Otakaare is number 1.
Mokoma band's bassist fell off stage in the middle of the show and was injured
The Mokoma band announces a surprising situation on their Facebook page at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
The Mokoma band's performance at Pakkahuone in Tampere took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
The Hämäläinen wrist was broken.
The band will announce this on their Facebook page.
I'm in the spirit...
Santtu tripped yesterday at Pakkahuone from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour will be done with backup, the website says.
Mokoma fans respond with concern to the photo update, where bassist-Santtu lies plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news has been awaited, I was quite worried about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones are thankfully healed over time.
Happy and quick recovery to Santtu and a good follow-up to the rest of the band plus to the recruiter!
And thanks for last night, it was a great show, but you promise to leave out such a strong dramatic show in the future? writes a fan.
Police monitor hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police department’s batch contact persons told social media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Every hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons and the quantities of self-loading weapons used in the chicken bird were checked.
According to police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during surveillance who lacked a required hunting permit.
The hunter was ordered to pay 12 daily fines for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown by police, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters follow the legitimacy of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the control.
A hunter said that I had been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time anyone had checked the permits.
The Police Department of Eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (kok.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps have been admitted to Finland.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly in need in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, people with disabilities and the sick, women and children.
More people will be selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some will not arrive for different reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet non-governmental organisations working on the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Talks about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 per year, but since then no agreement has been reached in the government to raise it.
The coalition has supported a quota increase, but the project has last fallen into resistance from the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) recently proposed increasing the quota gradually to 1,500-2 000 people a year.
During this term, Mykkänen’s visit will be the first one that the Minister of the Interior will make on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Risikko (kok.) were able to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for every refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now let's go to bed, you don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore.
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees, whether as farm animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities.
Therefore, everything else is in principle prohibited except the animals mentioned separately in the regulation.
If the bill ends up as a law, it means that we are rejecting in Western democracies the general principle that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or the good manner of society.
In principle, we are now imposing a ban on all activities to which the law or regulation does not expressly authorise.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business or do anything else until the law or regulation approving it has been passed.
The government’s role in drafting legislation in general has been weak.
If we start on the road that in Finland everything is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But this is not a legal project in the field of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder whether it will accept such a procedure - everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation.
I hope there is some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell Tips: The Four Trendiest Skirts of Autumn
This autumn's trend clothing comes in snake patterns.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Combine a snake-worn skirt with more subdued tops, such as a polo or an ordinary t-shirt to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn, silk is abundant and especially silk skirt is one of the most trendy clothing items of the season.
Combine a gorgeous silk skirt with a feminine top or casually paired with a knit.

Boldly combine different colors with each other and play with the pattern of diamonds even with the tops of different colors.
For example, the combination of a square pattern and a ball pattern is beautiful.
Asymmetric hems are a breeze in the lightness of summer, which can be taken with you to autumn.
At the same time, the asymmetrical hem is feminine and playful and fits nicely into both everyday life and celebration.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks sweetly in Jere's lap

Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the kindergarten.
Turkey urges to charge mobile phones in case of storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country of the Greek storm, according to CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
In early Saturday evening, disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access so that people can get up-to-date status updates, according to local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been told to stay home and away from windows, and to move garden furniture, for example, out of the way of the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and the wind is expected to blow 28 to 33 metres per second.
Greece Red Weather Warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
Not long ago, when I contacted him, the wind was very strong and it was raining.
The people were very calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
He also described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also received no messages from the Finns in distress.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, the local news agency Amna said.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected to occur to air and shipping.
On Saturday, Finnair announced that the weather situation was being monitored actively.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes's superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen admitted that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard on Russia's GP's schedule.
However, there is no reason to go into panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth-driver and teammate Sebastian Vettel, who clearly missed the Mercedes pace, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari had a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
The rapper was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are - as simple as it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don’t know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
During the time periods, a rare treat was seen for Räikkönen's future stable Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who replaced Räikkönen next season with Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time-run session.
For a Swedish driver, the 10th place to leave is the best in over three years.
And while in the second driving session as many as five drivers failed to drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps to encourage Räikkönen for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were from the early days, then the step forward has been a big one.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
Robert Helenius knocks out Erkan Teper: “Robbe is back”
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at Stuttgart's night progressed in steady signs.
The German was more proactive in the ring, but he could not get a decent hit.
Helenius, clearly larger, controlled the match with his tough sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the veteran who fought in front of the home audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius aired quite moderately.
At first, he praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then, for a moment, he changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a huge victory for Helenius’ career.
There might even be a chance to qualify for the World Cup, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
The loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This is not going to get any younger, the 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the disaster in Indonesia could multiply.
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers search for trapped and also dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city of Palu and its neighboring municipality Donggala.
So far, all of the victims are Palalu, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the abandoned buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard screams from people trapped in the rubble, but lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of rescue efforts.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the rescue and clearing of the army.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are broken in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist’s hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh
Billnäsin Ruukki is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, every Miss Finalist was asked a question.
The finalists pulled the question of a glass bowl on stage.
In particular, the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused a sweet but benevolent laugh in the audience present.
The question that was asked to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the latest book that the miss finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a while before he hesitated.
Thank you for the question, Linda.
The last book I’ve read is...” Anttikoski said thinking.
The pause of thought caused a laugh in the audience until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I have read is...
I read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I’ve read is the economics of someone,” Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Miss Tour Anttikoski attracted attention, as he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
Miss Finland of 2018 will be crowned at 21:00 when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm of last year gives up the crown.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue away
This recipe is for those of you who have good, acidic apples on their own back, as the domestic apple is shockingly expensive in the store.
You might have to buy a pear, although I think a lot of pear trees are already growing.
This cake can only be made from apples if you do not want to buy a pear.
The taste, of course, is more varied if the cake also contains its pear.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
You can melt in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar into foam and then add corn flour to the foam and melt butter.
Combine corn starch, or maizena, with baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the larva and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and apple lobes over the dough.
Spoil the rest of the dough on top of the apple lobes.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let cool down in the flux and then overturn the serving dish.
Cut the cake properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily crumbles because the dough contains almond and corn flour with no gluten in it.
Ruka to hold international crime literature event in January
Kuusamon Ruka will host an international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature for the first time in January.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers as well as jazz music.

In addition to the Swedish names, the event will also feature writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique surroundings of Kuusamo provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who analyzed the issue have outlined two slightly different types of coolness: generally attractive coolness and, to that extent, opposite dissident coolity.
The attractively cool people, according to the researchers’ description, had many features considered socially desirable: they were outward-looking, friendly, agreeable and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and edge.
They were thirsty for experience and paid little attention to external evaluations.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of kovis is not cool over time: high status in teens may not lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 U.S. study published in Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out the good-looking crowds and sought out the favor of others, had an increased risk of substance abuse and committing crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less well than they did in the past with their less discerning peers.
High-status luk ski cars, brand bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with a regular market shirt than with people wearing a branded shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a branded shirt when they got to know each other.
If you are in the Greek holiday islands, be careful!
There's a hurricane going on, the weather warning is screaming red.
During the weekend, it can rain as much water in southern Greece as in Finland, on average, over a six-month period.
The Zorbas storm hits Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are in Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The upcoming storm is also reported by the weather service foreca's blog.
According to it, the strongest gusts of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to comparison, the storm Kuisma, which beat Finland in the early part of the week, blew at its strongest in just over 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
During the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water can be produced in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on their Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland?
Appears on confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, several men’s drooling beauty Anku also appears on strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to prepare an octopus from an old paper roll.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how to make a hedgehog out of tights with the right spikes.
Now let’s make Easter grass grow, but let’s do it in a little surprising way, Anku insinuates and presents sawdust, pantyhose and fresh grass seeds from which he makes a hedgehog.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku’s YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and bursted adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook a little more than tens of minutes after his trip to Russia's GP pole position when he was in front of the media.
A great round left behind the first star of Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton, and was certainly an important psychological critique for the Finnish driver who collected this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the decision round.
It feels good, I still shake a little bit, Bottas explained.
I have only been on pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good tours again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so the departure plays a particularly big role.
And of course, Bottas was given the opportunity to ask if he was going to run for victory tomorrow, or if he was going to have Hamilton approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is that I try to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pole, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so it should be kept in mind.
Let’s see what happens, however, Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas after the ride, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also enjoyed the taste.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtteri, but he did not succeed in the 7th corner.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline was bursting out of his ears.
Whether the team lets Bottas and Hamilton drive uprightly, Wolff answered dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen wins Finnish Rally Championship
The SM-series of Rally Cars ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
It was now done by Erik and Henrik St. Petersburgen from Tusula in a closing rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kiteelainen Erno Kinnunen secured the best achievement of his career, when the third place in the final race sealed him with the Finnish championship of the two-wheel drive SM4 class.
Kinnunen, who competes at Honda Civic and Ville Mäkelä, a map reader, started the Turku part-time competition in Malta, because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to level out as some of the extra lights failed with another special test.
It was time for a third round of blindness.
In a situation like this, you can't get caught.
On Saturday, it was only the second time that Jussi Tepo was on the show, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the US, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, said foreign troops had to leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war on terrorists, he said, is almost over.
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
There is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting on Syria was planned for October, with the French, Russian and Turkish presidents joining her.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Judge Drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated for the Supreme Court, and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptionally large number of people on the screens.
In the United States, a full-fledged Supreme Court judge nomination drama attracted at least 20 million people to its televisions on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Justice Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more online consultations followed.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had set its record for the year with 8.2 million live streaming starts.
CNN's number rises by more than 10 million, counting those following the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are the channels’ own, TV viewers’ figures are from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will be releasing the final readings on Monday, but they will be staggering in any case.
Few reach 20 million
Over 20 million viewers in the United States are usually only allowed to attend sports matches, as well as the major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The most watched program in the United States, the American Football League's final match for the Super Bowl, is certainly a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl attracted around 103 million people to NBC.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and about 30 million people at the inauguration.
The most important thing
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely important case in the United States, as the positions are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called scales language whose voice could determine the position of a nine-member court.
He was a proponent of abortion law and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015 decided, for example, with his vote that same-sex marriage rights were obtained throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the court for decades of conservative supremacy.
Children have the right to be informed by parents
Only parents of children under the age of 10 can see their children’s health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Of course, the situation in Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of the little ones.
A temporary correction to the situation was made in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but the repair has taken an amazingly long time.
The repair is now in place - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a call-through.
After that, the layman's understanding is about the click of a button: now that the wire is closed, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information - if he or she has bank IDs or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do they have?
The ID card is subject to a fee, and the 10-year-old does not even receive bank IDs.
Thus, in practice, no one can see the information of a fourth grader except by asking them to be printed.
It is not so much about the right of parents as it is about the right of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations where all things cannot be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the U.S., the FBI began to investigate allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh.
According to media reports, the FBI is investigating harassment allegations from at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation must not take longer than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to pulverize even at the station.
Police say they put a man in a police prison -- to calm down --
Police were threatened by a suspected abuser on Saturday night in Kajaani.
The authorities reported the incident that began when a man of 30 years and over challenged a dispute in a downtown restaurant.
He first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by pouring him into the ground.
When the third party intervened, the man struck him as well.
The triple mistreatment led to the call of the police.
The patrol took the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police said.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police said they had sent the man to a police prison to calm down.
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid organizations are preparing to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia -- the clean water is the most urgent --
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, says Kirsi Haru, the information manager of UNICEF Finland.
Local authorities are leading the rescue efforts, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the town of Palu, Sulawes, rescue operations are underway, but in the Donggala area, the situation is slightly more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings at Sulawesi are often light-built, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is large.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter - first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First of all, people are often able to offer water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in store.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported to the first place, for example by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and uniting families is one part of UNICEF’s mission field.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP).
In the initial phase, previously collected funds will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF has already started a fundraising campaign to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla's board with $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by contract with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk resigns as chairman of Tesla’s board of directors and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of a deal he signed with the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission threatened Musk for securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which caused the company's share price to rise rapidly.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to serve as Chairman of the Tesla Board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new, independent member of its Board of Directors and take on two independent leaders in its Management Team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk’s personal $20 million fine, Tesla is also forced to pay $20 million in similar fines to the financial controller.
Tweezers have misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
Billionaire tweets said the company would have been bought off the stock exchange at a price of $420.
Tesla's share price rose by more than ten percent in a day after the tweets, but later fell.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other management team or the company’s Board of Directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 percent when the SEC filed a fraud charge.
The agreement is expected to re-enforce the company’s course.
The Last Judgment Is Not the Reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
This is a technical failure.
The clock at the Tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The sages point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror film: still when an exorcism is heard from the church's crypt and the organ plays by itself.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
A repairman has been watching it, but some parts have been broken and a new part is expected,” says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki-Twitter account.
The account states that the final judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of the fault.
