28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell in a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Forensic Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, formerly a chef in Boston, had found his dream job of becoming a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
“We’re a small and tight team, like a family. We’re very sorry,” the representative says.
Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends.
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he first lived in hostels, but he had finally gotten his affairs in order.
He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend, told Louis Galicia at the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook for all of us, says Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who walked with the river.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day — he says.
Everyone who knows anything about the incident is asked to call San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
Young Doctors on Strike Call for New Workplace Action
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are mainly specialised in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new industrial action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The junior medical committee (JDC) of the British Federation of Physicians (BMA) is requesting support from its entire government for further labour-fighting operations from early September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the contract with BMA in a vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter to JDC members on Twitter on Thursday night, where she says the government -- persistently silent -- on issues that McCourt said led to a rejection of the deal.
The letter reads: “In light of this, the JDC government has voted against a completely new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all of our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government asking permission for gradual expansion of industrial action since early September.
Due to the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of junior doctors at the BMA, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract recommended by the BMA.
Malawina told BMA members at the pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an outside alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands as a reconciliation and to formally complete the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I received the clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The two sides shook hands,
But Putin’s smile looked thin and he didn’t get much heat from him even by his own reticent standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his good friend, Mr. Putin, according to a report, five times.
I couldn't keep count myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I understood his enthusiasm exactly the opposite.
But the constant coolness of Putin showed that the head of Russia has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction to the event was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing his back.
The injury was even greater because it came from an assumed friend.
Recovering true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media waged a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the allegations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting was only held so that Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could gain some kind of victory.
The benefits of proclaiming a cease-fire to the severe are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost overthrown last month in a failed coup.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially a charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly sigh of relief as air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in the late evening rush to the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall when Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
-Tourists there, tomatoes back here - was formulated in an article in the financial magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it thinks the West is reacting subduedly to the coup attempt.
Not to forget the old resentment over the progress of Turkey's EU accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, which is eager to take advantage of cool relations and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, who has his own intense concern about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, during their summit at the spectacular seaside palace, could convey an image described by an analyst as a “outside alliance”: two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, unite.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most notable is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
Says a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press conference that they had not dealt with the issue at all.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where they can seek consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter plane, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are even speaking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS Bank, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced by providing only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally related to the bank's global goals.
The bank was forced to withdraw from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let national brands into the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but will not use the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation directed at customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “RBS is turning into an investment brand and that’s why our staff is working because we’re now becoming a much more diverse brand bank.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something very different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
“Now is the right time to become a bank with different brands, because basically it’s a question of how we can make the bank better for our customers,” the bank’s CEO said.
“It would have been very foolish three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on customer needs, rather than our own needs, have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to win at Newmarket and achieved his 3,000th win
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row in Newmarket, which meant he won 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in races running on a flat track.
He was previously joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but an entirely ordinary Friday night and a crowd of 20,000 people.
I am relieved and have great humility.
Dettori receives cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it’s no surprise that he just reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical skill is what distinguishes him from others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and pruning has brought supporters to the sport for many years.
“I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have won 6,000 races if he didn’t compete only on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the UK Games has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He's a lively person, which is good for a British race ride, but above all, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori aired his achievement in an emblematic way by flying down from his horse's back.
Frankie Dettori has been an example of British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs.
He has won numerous major races, including his famous victory in Ascot from 1996 to the Magnificent Seven, but has also survived a plane crash and been banned for drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had trouble starting, but he showed admirable strength of character, looked to his doubters and returned to his best.
And for a while now, he's not ending his career - Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career until at least 50 years old -
Putin sacks Administrative Director Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin -decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration - but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, who served as Ivanov's deputy manager since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the President's Protocol Department and the government's office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: “I am grateful for your confidence.
In my view, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state, which means drafting draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told a Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a member of Vladimir Putin's circle, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting shown by Russian state television with President Putin, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations assure only a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Is it because of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious of the official claim that a man who has been praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: \"It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give my responsibilities to this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I've been president's head of administration for four years and eight months...
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin served as head of the KGB-replaced Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's immediate circle, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and then returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds: FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced the release in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner on the show, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
We had creative differences.
I’m sorry that this happened, he said in his statement.
Information on how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Formerly in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first season, that is, since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
“I hoped I could see the show until the end, but that’s no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and the most important of all: the best fans the show could ever have wished for.
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
The mysterious landing of fish in the Banff Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind fish that have been caught in the land as cyclones.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision in Periscope and hoped to get a response to the appearance of these five-centimetre fish.
Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife
The cost of the £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and land bridge of the Queensferry overpass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections —between the curtains — that are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sling wire.
The cost of the £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Cabinet Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from land to bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30,000 concrete and steel being used to build this bridge section alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely accurate installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted into place -
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: “The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urethra in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this contribution represents the top of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and attached to the road cover of the North Tower pillar, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e., the terrestrial) gap.
This was done by pulling the north side of the land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time a high-precision operation.
Massive because the earth bridge is 222 metres in length and about 6,000 tons in weight and had to be pulled up at a slope angle of about 3%.
And high-precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went well...
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports on the miraculous rescue of three men
Three men from their fishing boat off Anglesey were miraculously saved.
Moelfre RNLI's sea rescue station made an alert on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew detected an accident in the Moelfre Bay Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
“We saw the boat orbit right next to them and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
“By the time we got out, the strong winds had thankfully carried the boat away from them.
A local fishing boat saved two of the men, while a third, aged 60 years old, was found exhausted stuck in a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all taken aboard a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says: “It’s a miracle that these three men who are on the water are still alive and well.
There was an emergency fire-extinguishing cord in the engine of the boat, but for some reason it had been detached from the man who drove the boat during the crash.
They were very fortunate in their journey.
Pokémon Go hunting brings health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay inside to stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, screen time was limited to watching TV, then video games and, most recently, smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor exercise don’t rule out each other.
Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters are derived from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also produced a cartoon series, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also dropped slightly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of Pokémon Go game users passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out looking for pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked using GPS. When you find a pokémon, it can be — photographed — (using a phone screenshot) or — captured —
Wildness has tricked the generation that played the video game when they were younger and lifted the butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps the average person takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported that the Apple Watch smartwatch from Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game's launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53 percent. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have echoed into deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
People who regularly move are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three basic health benefits: exercise, fresh air, sun and joy.
During the hunt, you can even make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disapproval of the fun-killers.
And yes, when you play, you can walk towards the door.
What about it?
Breakthrough's done.
However, even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could have previously tracked your activity, they didn’t give you a reason to start moving, as Pokémon Go does.
New charm disappears, and use decreases in due course.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people leaving the yacht and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles took gold in women's gymnastics multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
No trouble at the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
Great in everything.
Finally, the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old scaffolding gymnast won the multiplayer championship on Thursday and grew the distinction between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of silver-placed —Final Five — teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States appears on the boom in the final of the individual women's gymnastics competition multiplayer on Thursday at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
He became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman to win the multiplayer title, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his finale's total points appeared and his long road to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and puts him in the same category with other sports superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been absolutely superior in his sport for the past three years. He has won 15 World Cup medals, of which 10 golds, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him — the greatest scaffolding gymnast of all time —
In Brazil, there was still one final race, which took place above all between Biles and the burden of his own self and the burden of overriding expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver in the finals of the individual women's gymnastics competition on Thursday at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11 August 2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of i for the departure of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and now retires.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes a volt series known as his trump card, is adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Already when his grandparents were little, adopting and finding coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a power figure. Boorman found the girl while she was on a daycare tour in the gymnasium where Boorman trained.
He has not lost a single multiplayer race since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina reached a small lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a permanto where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead after receiving 15,433 points from the boom and crowned the result with 15,933 points from the permage.
Raisma gently hugged him as they waited for the final dots — which was a mere formality — and tears began to appear around Biles' red, white and blue glittering crop color when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a minor rematch to the competition four years ago when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to the Mustafina in a re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team — the grandparents — was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent air kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus rose from a losing position to a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old tweet made earlier in the week and widespread now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three people listening to music in the car have been killed by a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest mass murder in ten years. The victims sat in the car talking and listened to music when they were shot, police said on Thursday.
Authorities said on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a parked car.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped by another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the reason for the triple murder was not the robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix Police spokesperson, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in areas inhabited by Hispanics within four months.
“It is common for events to have occurred in residential areas off homes,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital due to his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
A witness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police released a statement about the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple murder, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found shells and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and from the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: “Things are getting better”
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes to sing, toy and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or innate small-headedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, which he was not aware of when pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I couldn’t get away with this.
I'm not gonna get away with this.
I'm not committed to this.
Which is not at all true, of course you are committed to it, he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any such practice anymore,” Picciuto said.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund got up and started to crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's signature by which he means - a song for me -
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
It does not, however, mean just the usual sign language, but it also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
There can be a number of different diseases behind microcephaly: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
The symptoms and prognosis vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
I'm always working on it. How are we going to do it?
What will happen to us...
And he still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for a prediction in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me.
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the Governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, and more rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers of South-East Louisiana and South-Mississip flood over their bilge and spread over a wide area as a result of intense heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards reports that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the National Security and Emergency Response Office, said the agency received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipahoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sacks of sand.
The flood warning will remain in effect until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to a statement issued by the Weather Service, more water may enter the area between 76 and 27 mm.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile region.
During the weekend, near the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are projected to rise to record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
In Liverpool, Louisiana, the Tickfaw River, flowing south of the Mississippi state border, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were earlier among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose quickly during the night.
A second stepmother who lived nearby had warned him.
“We got up, and the water came with constant feeding,” Hansford said.
It extended to my waist.
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she had lived in the area.
Hansford reports that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three of them to a large military-style truck and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says floods will spread rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information received from an observer near Livingston that it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil got heavily wet after the rains that started on Wednesday.
Authorities reported that due to heavy rains and street flooding, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
County Director Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
The evacuations have opened shelters in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
“They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat,” he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and businesses' premises.
“For the last time, we experienced a major flood in March,” said Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
This flood seems to be the same.
In Mississippi, the rains continued steady along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, Harrison County's rescue director.
Lacy reports that a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but no news had yet been received on Friday.
Keith Townson, shop manager at Shopper Value Foods, said he lived in Amite for 40 years.
I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time.
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who received multiple bullets in his body, survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot dead in Philadelphia, the second six-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
\"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets,\" the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the television company.
I can't believe this is real.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting the first class at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
The second 29-year-old condition was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between several armed men.
The scene was full of assault weapon-type shells that originated from various assault weapons.
It is clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shells on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting — Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police say they're going through surveillance videos.
Another victim of the shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was hit by a stray bullet while playing outside her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's gymnastics Olympic team, and there is more than one cause.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie — Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's line-up, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, and surprising and masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a multiplayer women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but the same does not look like in scaffolding gymnastics classes nationwide.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They’re the last five —Final Five — as there will be only four gymnasts in the next stage gymnastics team, and this will be Marta Karoly’s final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnast clubs maintained by their parents. Parents pay for training costs, facilities, trips, appearances, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most scaffolding clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The teaching of scaffolding gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means expensive and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have both coached sports enthusiasts since they started scaffolding gymnastics.
We must provide cheaper and better accessible gymnastics education for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered free or affordable opportunities for scaffolding activities for over 15,000 young people in the city (mostly black and Latin American), and some of these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality stand gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start a scaffolding gymnastics, and it’s absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real -- the girl power you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls of different backgrounds to start their way into well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute on changes to pay and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors, but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force a deal and said the UK's public health system (NHS) is - no one's land - and that any further delay is harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA junior medical committee, issued a statement last night saying: “Junior doctors are still very reserved about the proposed agreement. A particular fear is that it will accelerate the current labor crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to, and sometimes even not reacting in any way.
Even so, Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for new action in the field of industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.
Trade union BMA wants better weekend pay for 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the deal.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive officer of the NHS, called on junior doctors not to launch new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services that are already at extreme limits and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the junior medical committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
Employees were hopeful that a continued positive commitment to other important topics — such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector — was a sign of how seriously employees, Health Education England, and the Ministry of Health want to keep up with BMA in November, February and May —
A day of $2.40 can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to receive a $2.40-paying drug per day when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already being administered 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a UK public health system (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), a member of the British Public Health System (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, one-quarter of whom have a heart attack or have a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels and produces plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot breaks off, it can pass along with the bloodstream and prevent the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor manufactured by AstraZeneca in the UK, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guidance published today recommends that ticagrelor be administered for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a dose reduction to 60 mg and an additional twice daily administration of aspirin for an additional three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Center for the Evaluation of Methods of Treatment (NICE) says: “While effective methods are available to prevent disease progression and symptoms from occurring effectively, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new attack or stroke — often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it.
Given the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in terms of risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period of time.
Due to the climate of political correctness, voter fraud in Muslim regions flourished
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed from his post last year due to corruption, resulting in a report from the government
A climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report released today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticizes the police, election observers and city councils for having closed their eyes to electoral fraud — because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion —
According to Pickles, known as the former Minister of Regional Government and as a force against corruption today, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect the feared voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity document in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter only needs to state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to dip fingers in indelible black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be given to whistleblowers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access of journalists to government documents and decisions by informal boards and working groups.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to fight corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments,” he said.
The British Prime Minister requested a report to East London after the Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman be dismissed from his post due to corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The court ruled that Rahman was mocking the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to base his campaign on the religious duty of every believer Muslim to vote for him.
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently cast in such a way that a person voted by pretending to be another person.
According to Sir Eric, evidence of fraud was obtained across the country.
He expressed particular concern about postal election fraud, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring identification at the polling station.
The report says: “There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of older members, especially in communities with a Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.
“They were concerned that... the institutions of the state had closed their eyes to such action — politically correct — because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballots, in order to prevent -- the harvesting of votes.
Currently, Theresa May's current report also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider alternatives that would require voters to present an identity card before voting.
Dividing fingers into indelible black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Denying political activists to deal with the sounds and envelopes sent by post.
The police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Changing the law to make it easier to prosecute intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the Extension of Voting Rights.
Banning photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Improving training in order to ensure staff control the rule that only one person at a time can enter the voting booth.
Sir Eric harshly criticizes the London police and finds —astounding — that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
“The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for their role because of corruption and numerous unlawful practices,” he said.
He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inefficient — tick checks — of the departments responsible for the city council’s electoral lists.
“The court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call,” said Sir Eric.
“Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and its denial by some parties.
The Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers fascinate at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for a championship with a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on cycling tracks, many people have quoted in social media how one archer could be the twin brother of actor Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison caused a storm after images of him posted on Twitter, in which he strikingly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the noise on social media and admitted to having heard since childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
“I don’t see the resemblance as so big, maybe with the exception of a beard and a mustache,” Brady Huffington told the Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment.
At the 2012 London Games, the resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris was shrugged, which will undoubtedly be even more highlighted in these races.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, who is big and expressive, has been described as a double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
The South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison from the Glee television series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the “atletetic version” of the actor in the movie Inception.
Similarly, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been quoted, highlighted by the strong eyebrows and lips of both.
A silver medalist for swimming, Yulia Efimova of Russia resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not only because of her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team, according to his fans, is -- an athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt --
These two iron women, soccer star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter-series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their facial shapes and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for a couple of similarities.
A tweeter recently expressed his joy when — others on the internet agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter —
The American football star and the Dexter show actor really startlingly resemble each other with their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and in the wide smiles of Gabrielle Union, the gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna Palaa!.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer — dead as a pig —
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle message shocked viewers of CBC's live Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize since one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer — lost smell — and — dead like a pig during the race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone had been off when he started shooting his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200-metre freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard saying: “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, went fast, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that...
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to swim to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig?????
The idiot didn't realize he was on the air yet.
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, swimming in the final of the women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle message, was described in the following words: \"This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious comments by Byron MacDonald criticizing, and many demanded his dismissal.
Tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald's remarks: \"We apologize for the comment made on the swim performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened.
The CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator fellow Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued its regrets to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The television company also made a public apology.
“We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they made it to the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night’s broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words —
Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to defend his speeches by saying that he didn't mean it to be personal.
“I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s swim,” MacDonald said on a CBC Olympic broadcast.
I was referring to the swimmer’s performance, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn’t mean anything derogatory by my words, and I’m very sorry.
In Primark, a woman who adapted underwear in the middle of the store shocked customers
Customers did not know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to fit underpants.
He further exacerbated the situation by estimating what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off his leg and placing them back on the shelf.
He continued touring and eventually experimented with four pairs of underpants in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
A Primark chain shop in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the shop at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear and put them on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it with complete shame.
Everyone stared at him when he took the underwear he tried off his leg and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn’t like anything, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the look, and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he'd come up with.
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues: “How disgusting to think that someone is taking home the underwear someone else has worn and hasn’t washed.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understand that the shop staff was trying to remove the items from the sale after the woman left — which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without having been washed after that — more Davidson.
A spokesperson for Primark commented on the matter by saying: “Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from the market.
How to defend yourself against an armed attack with the help of Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video on Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the Grand Master of the Krav Maga League in New York and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser waving a gun within close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing to do is to turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and hit the attacker with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee into the groin, and when he goes from pain to double, slap him on the face with the barrel of the gun and back off by holding the gun aimed at him.
The technique is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist on the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun aimed at the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Keep in mind, however, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash — unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Travel guide traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and kakomis reflex to the hard test by licking the dirtiest and most repulsive places in Europe.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of her resistance by licking euro banknotes, a handrail in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a luminameter to see for himself and show viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film, Ian Wright, on the trail of inner strength, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the toilet button on a train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
While traveling across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen good gut bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, everything he licked caused nothing but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright was first known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
licking the rail stations handrails and toilet flush button undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary: “I have been quite careless about my health since I was a child and have put in my mouth all sorts of things, such as dirt, worms and curvature.
In the film, he proved to be worthy of his reputation.
The border came only in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came across a Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to lick when the luminary measured 4000 units — in newly washed hands, the same figure is less than 60.
Wright adventures in a documentary film produced together with Valio, Ian Wright, on the trail of internal force, where the number of bacteria is made visible in various places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary: “This is almost the worst smell I’ve smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here...
Wright produced a documentary film, Ian Wright, on the tracks of internal force in collaboration with Valio.
From Valio, Wright received Valio Gephilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut's good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager for Valio’s snack, juice and novelty products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and eventually we ended up with the idea of asking Ia to come along.
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the documentary allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humor.
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: “Let’s say I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which will also be shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks filmed on tape...
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents included lactic acid bacteria, especially for stomach and gut well-being, and 58 per cent said they used products with lactic acid bacteria added to them at least occasionally.
Distracted family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before being evicted
The disrupted family left behind £50,000 in damage to the town-owned rental house after being evicted due to the terrorization of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldo and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, following numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company found that the apartment was in a state of shock.
The walls had gaping holes, the floor boards had been torn off, debris had been spread on the floors, and the walls had been truncated with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to live in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be able to be saved.
“This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is a lot to consider, as the property is likely to be known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, just like its name.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to police, the family's tyranny involved street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and caring, and loud shouting, quarreling and swearing.
Skeldon, a 47-year-old who signed the lease, received an anti-social behavior order in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the threat of demolition.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Office evicted the couple by coercive means this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to move away voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, \"They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived in their neighborhood for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times.
This morning we couldn’t sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It's gonna be great now that they've finally been evicted...
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of forced fillings at the Cornwall Housing Office, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time police were regularly called in.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her family’s behavior, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Authority is considering.
This case was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my working group, to the Devon and Cornwall police and to the members of the community who took part in the work and offered to give us information with courage.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
A dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Homeowners now have to clean out the piles of garbage surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis plus scales and other supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for being found guilty of possession of Class B drugs with the intention of selling it.
He claimed the money was for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard moving to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction of tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who are constantly defying the rules.
“This is a clear message to those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior,” Crow said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and antisocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach-hit army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft crashed surprisingly low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over the full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes almost to contact distance on a sandy beach from sunbathing tourists in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got on their feet as they understandably worried about the thunder of jet engines that began to sound before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the vacationers who photographed the dramatic flyby and posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: “It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing down —
I was surfing and I was sure that the plane would fall on me.
Tourists on Aveiro beach were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew surprisingly low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the plane had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but according to the Air Force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the low visibility caused by heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exote's first half result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote’s profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues.
The exote covers a deficit previously created by a surplus.
The remaining portion of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers Sworn in Military Whale in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
A military oath ceremony for conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Frontier Jaeger Course took place on the garrison's sports field.
A military oath was made by 70 conscripts.
Special frontier icebreakers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special limit.
250 of them were invited to the selection exams.
Special icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The Veterans' Meeting held in connection with the Vala event included five veterans of the wartime frontier forces.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A circle of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had an RTA, or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's run by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The chief officer is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civil person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The setting up of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police are less and less likely to go to the place of the swamps until they receive an alert.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
Along with the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages the operations nationwide.
According to its name, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in divided areas according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in RTA have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminal or mutually similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, the author will form a certain image.
The selection can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public.
There is no indication of the methods used by both the criminals and their own, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent crime prevention attempts by the police.
Police will tell you in public if they expect to pose a threat.
This was the case, for example, in early summer, of the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housebreaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to try whether the residents were actually traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest order the minutes of the District Court, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, the thieves will go with their gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyze information to help plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of Finland and its own institution.
ISIS-related London schoolgirl killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News said Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family was just planning to flee a war-torn country and return to Britain.
“You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will, so that people will understand that this is a real risk when going to the war zone — and that will make people give up the decision to leave,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court Judge if elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's appointment after he was appointed by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said at a phone conference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland with little certainty.
Reid's spokesperson later stated that this was merely speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether she was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want - to swing the boat - to pick someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District Court of Columbia County.
Reid says Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are presidential candidate Donald Trump's -- the orders -- and -- the advanceers --
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong to women as well as men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and launches a 1970s style and Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity-blowing magazine is different from the old-school Playboy magazine, as he says: “Playboy is for men.
I do this to women.
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
“We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity where women, just like men, can enjoy and be inspired by these images that praise the female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
“Women are sure to want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.
Those who wish to be a model in the calendar can post their photos online or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: who buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write an angry objection to the comment section under the pseudonym NoväAllLonelyMen of Middle Ages, this claim is based on real research data.
According to YouGov research firm, behind the new arrival of much-spoken vinyl records is not a millennial generation boom, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead the background is middle-aged nostalgia.
The age of a recently purchased vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely buyers.
Nor is it just the desire of amateurs to pick up records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl record buyers are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the lively Soho Street, wearing an embroidery-free grey jacket suit. I'd play lively, bend my hands into a cup, and say something traditional, such as:
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over facilities owned by private entrepreneurs before, however, a handful of specialty record stores remain.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I get very close to the men visiting these stores and try to evaluate their age and character.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (customers at the time two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (customers at the time eight middle-aged men, one probably in her twenties) are on a meeting trip to London for an afternoon and spend her extra time exploring the supply of shops.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
I think I am, he says.
I have about 3,000 to 3,000 records.
These plates fill his living room wall, as you can see from the picture. (Stuart sent me the photo by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
“I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get it,” he said.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much.
It's my bad...
Sister Ray's Wez, 25, also believes that many of their customers fit into the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people affected by media hype. These people have heard about the re-entry of vinyl records and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
“Based on the discussions I had attended, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their vinyls, he says.
This can explain the boom of certain age vinyl awakenings.
What about the alleged emotional significance of audio recordings?
In just a few seconds, you will realize in a movement like Phonica that they offer a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers have been particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may shock some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar disk cases means permanence and reminds them of the happy days of youth.
“I think it sometimes fills a gap or acquires material possessions to some degree of comfort,” says Wez.
This is how I feel about it as a collector, and I believe so many others too.
It's an easy way to get your mind off of me.
We're like social workers - cheer Wez's co-worker from behind the pile of records.
An ICM poll conducted in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to their album.
An opinion poll also reported that 41 percent have a record player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers don’t have a record player at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while I was browsing a stack of Bossa Nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl records also involves a -- a trophy phenomenon -- observed by Jonny, 42, seller of the Sounds of the Universe movement (customers at the time three middle-aged men).
“A customer recently came to the store and said he doesn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny said.
“The proportion of such customers is not large, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don’t have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly in their teens, who are just starting a hobby —
The customer base is considerably more varied in Fopti, which I will arrive at next. The store has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl records.
The clients are 70-year-old couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers delights, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous moves: instead of rocking jazz from the speakers, Wild Beasts’ latest sex-driving synthesizer pop.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is difficult to detect by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various discs on sale.
He's watching rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the finest thing about wine is, he lets out a fond sigh and continues:
I can't explain, they're so unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping jeans shorts, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while. I see a father and a daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and part so high that they can’t even reach it.
They are pure -art vinyl -decoration.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little to complain about.
It is no surprise that the population group, which is most likely to have more time and money than most, also has the group that spends the most money on luxuries such as vinyl records.
Although, based on my research, YouGov's results are correct, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old television host who stares scaryly and glances at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The ice shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is ice shark.
According to Hail Scientist Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged between 272 and 12 years in the study.
French court rejects request for demolition of jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities demanding that dozens of temporary shops and restaurants be demolished in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to dissolve 72 temporary shops set up at the refugee camp. The shops sell different items to the refugees from tobacco to energy drinks and provide haircuts. In temporary restaurants, tea can be bought for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Prefects of Calais, these shops and restaurants need to be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and are subject to fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as the free meals offered by the state-sponsored organization and other parties are not enough for the camp's ever-growing population.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but found the concerns of the Prefect of Calais -- fully understandable --
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are of far greater importance than just providing food to people who -- living in extremely unstable conditions --
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to the hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp whose status is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring a children's café to be maintained.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record high, to over 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food is reduced sharply to the pleasure of consumers and to the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the second most in EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
In comparison countries only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager of Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices reached close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then came the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now being weighed by Russian food import bans, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been shown as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the price of food, we need to halve VAT to the average of EU countries and continue to compete in prices,” Lehtinen wrote.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
Those returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been drawn up, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a rule that all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding is started in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin by the fourth.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was once thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the following, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-cent Amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years of age at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300, no salesmen cut
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
Co-operative companies in a company that ran into difficulties ended in early August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, the majority of which will be implemented as redundancies,” Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of vendors in department stores will not be reduced to prevent customer service from being affected.
In addition, around 80 support workers are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the time of their start, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store profitable are at the background.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store still makes losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
“Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018” says Veijalainen in the statement.
The result improvement for the second quarter was particularly driven by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and earnings ever.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the same period last year, the total Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, HS meteorologist.
There are also rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there is a pout in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as the whole country has less than 20 degrees of mercury.
In the northern rainy areas, 10-15 degrees Celsius remain.
Kenya's Athletics Team Shakes Doping Scandal - A Bizarre Explanation of Coach's Temptation
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete on which Anzrah attempted to perform is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenya national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi says Anzrah was sent home because he committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We can’t accept this kind of behavior — the Kenyan Olympic Committee chairman Kip Kiinte, on the other hand, would ram the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is one of Rio's winning favourites in advance.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah only walked on the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When he was met by anti-doping officials, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed, the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium.
On Friday, Rio started a battle for athletic medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stand.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day of the morning and 65% of the tickets for the evening were sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium bulged with cheering crowds.
Final tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympic Games have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty seats have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal wishes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and only about 30 percent of the audience of 12,000 were full.
The bad thing is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian racer, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not get the football stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for race organisers, said 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is a much smaller number than four years ago.
“There are still 1.1 million remaining to sell,” Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, as organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less well-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places in Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacaba has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and entities can redeem the rights of holders of land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those willing to acquire the right of holder for a fee.
The holder receives a veto in his 187-square-square-foot block, which in practice means that not every holder is required to be approved if the purpose of use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Obtaining the right of administration is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature — Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right to control his company, explains.
A person who has acquired the right to control receives accurate location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The names of the holders of the rights displayed on the Foundation’s website are shown on the same map where the block information of the land can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation’s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The Haltija project of the Helsinki Foundation is based on the idea of protecting nature areas so that they can be untouched and at peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchasing or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and is planning a land acquisition from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turkey - see the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves torment the biggest cities in Finland, Turkey.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bike thefts reported to the police, which in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year have stolen bicycles and their parts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top.
According to police reports, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
In other cities, double the number of thefts compared to others, according to police inspector Tommi Ree.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer.
“The prevalence of theft can be influenced by how much bikes are used in the city and how many bikes there are at all,” says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
The Finnish Police Board Tommi Reen considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
The market has a tight centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where city centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, there have been slightly fewer bicycle thefts to the police in January-August than in the corresponding period last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police are reporting a little more than 20,000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes a year.
It's a lot of money, Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a report of bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police survive.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in blood.
“Cases can also be resolved in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug case in the apartment,” says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, inner yards, warehouses and wheel cellars, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, the most stolen of individual bike models is Jopoja.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but much of the stolen bikes end up being sold online, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
“At least it has not been known to the police that a lot of stolen bikes are going abroad,” Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he can commit a crime or violation of concealment.
“The alarm clocks should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clearly low price,” Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa every day during his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but no one has been stolen, says the Moose.
“Perhaps this does not attract thieves so much, there may not be a hipster value here either,” says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike snuggled the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike into something fixed, like a bike rack.
“There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I have ever owned — a student in Helsinki says about his white bike, whose body alone cost about 500 euros.
All the time, you hear from your friends that the wheels have been stolen.
- Mostly bad spins, like sleazy Jopoes...
A bicycle was stolen from the building’s inner courtyard a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve could wait to take it.
Under 15-year-olds are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki to test peer-to-peer crews from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer jury is tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment applies to children under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
Peer jury intervenes in the first juvenile crime.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everyone steers the young person’s actions in a more responsible direction so that not everything is ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model has been introduced into the Peer Jury from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not come before an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, service designer at Palmu, the service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It has been a message that you should continue on the path you have chosen,” Lovio says.
The Peer Jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just migrant youth.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft to see it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be diverted to Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his recklessness, incompetence, and record unpopularity threaten to bring the Democrats a landslide in this election,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from — people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress — and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton Offers Relief to US Families with Children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy is doing well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by increases in the tax of the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American businessmen who suffer after factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I oppose any trade agreement that works against employees or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program announced by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for favoring only millionaires like this.
Clinton has previously called Trump a loophole in corporate taxes.
On Thursday, Clinton announced that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small businesses whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are the Rio ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a high number of spectators.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the screens: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the European Athletics Championships one month ago attracted almost 800,000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
The most interesting thing about the Olympic Games so far has been the cycling of Sunday night and the scaffolding gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the race, both reaching the Olympic channel at a time nearly half a million spectators.
Yle sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and recalls that the viewers will be divided for the first time in the Rio Olympics into several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympic Games.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competition for which Yle has dedicated a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - much of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a weak interest - if anyone now thinks it's lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're going to be around 200,000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get online ratings later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as intended for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio will be visible on Yle’s channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some sports from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the competitions daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle’s channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 meters in Ristenselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a press of about 20 square metres on the Ristiback, the depth of which was 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres stretch from Lake Toisvesi, Lake Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There might well be unknown depths, Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of medium depth, it is Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
In this way, Päijänne cannot reach the ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph with the deepest middle depths of the lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax cut: Pensioners' taxation continues to be tighter
Pensioners are still more heavily taxed than wage-earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievances were raised under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage and salary earners.
The Government’s proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made after the election should be kept, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The issue heated up opposition representatives in the parliament, who then grilled the finance minister Alexander Stubb (kok.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not increase
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Kok.) is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo’s messages about the desire to honour the competitive agreement that has been achieved with great effort.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It comes in need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own confidence in the future.
Involved in long-term unemployment
Ihalainen appeals to the government that it would tackle long-term unemployment in the budget debate, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were approximately 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of increasing the employment rate to 72 per cent will run out.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season dates to the turn of the year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook following the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen says the perpetrator of the attack is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and to a referendum last week on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced that they were opposed to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population persists, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She said it was the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourists' favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a popular tourist destination in Finland, four bombs exploded at night on holiday island Phuket, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in each double bomb attack.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used for the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta that controls Thailand, says the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We should not incite people to panic any more,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but it is worth following the non-exhaustive instructions for caution, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims that took place during the night in Finland.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been a little bit more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in Hua Hin's last attack.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The chief of police, interviewed by CNN, says that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half an hour or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Aliya Mustaf of Russia with a third performance of 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for scaffolding championships at the Rio Games with permano, jump and boom.
Biles has been managing women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The lower World Cup medals at the Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: ‘Isku has no impact on tourism’
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don’t think there will be anything more amazing about this,” Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, estimated.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu and last year the bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this is hardly the case either.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called at about nine o'clock local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o’clock during the day in Thailand, traffic on Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later this car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to the motor vehicle.
The police are grateful for the clues.
Research leader on Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, Russia’s highest-ranking change in leadership took place in years when President Vladimir Putin sacked the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov is succeeded by 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second husband.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling management positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop in Ivanovville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino as his replacement, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear station drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not of high priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, has recently been changed in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute for Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin is changing his surroundings to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as a human shield while retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them,\" said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry’s Communications Director says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the prestigious Games.
He injured his back way from the early season and was forced to skip the Olympic qualification in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-wear samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Around Porina Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the initial 200 metres at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, crushing the world record and competitors' self-confidence despite the finale of the party, at a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached the end of his career with a watch.
The world record for Berlin was 9.58 by 100 metres and 19.19 by two hundred.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's biggest challenge is the 2004 Athens 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the prestigious Games if he has made his way.
In Daegu, 2011 the 100 World Cup final was left unrun by Bolt due to cheating.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the sport of young men, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
As the final finish line for the career, Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,\" Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone Epo.
He finished fourth in Rio in a women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has filed a doping case with the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping allegations in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone Epo.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach from Rio home because of the doping crime.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test and had given a doping test for him.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan fast track coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Phelps won't be stopped - historical gold comes in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in a 200-metre mix of his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach Olympic gold of the same sport in four consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second in the mix before Wang Shuni of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic Swimming Commentator Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview in Evening Magazine.
A story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much stressed out if there is little noise in social media or in the British press about his revealing and peculiar costumes.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress with at least enough revealingness - for the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
There are no back steps, however.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
Skelton certainly wants to sparkle and perhaps startle, but he stresses that he does not want to be the lead role.
This is not about me, he said.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that it has reached Finland?
I can’t, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me.
You know what?
It's a stir from nothing if it comes from dressing up (the host).
I'm a little bit amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people for suspected terrorism
Rio police said Thursday that it had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the Games.
The police made five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before they were released.
All of the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news website, those arrested because of terrorism are among the same group that was arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links to the Islamic State.
Those arrested had reportedly sparked violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The Rio Games have 85,000 police officers in charge.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the audience in after they had successfully blown up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
Police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The audience was able to enter after the police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not reach the audience by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the public in the hall only after that.
The drink awakened the Spanish team that started the competition sleepyly.
Spain, which started the two defeats, won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two games, Spain achieved silver.
The police conducted a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The police last had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling goal site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of Rio basketball tournaments in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame snuggles Petäjä-Siren - Finnish protester
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren experienced a hard time on Thursday.
The Argentine dame bled Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the Women's Surf Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others escaped, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
It was not worth it because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
“I should have fallen into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last, because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
In the crash, the Finnish left 27th place.
In total, the 2012 London Olympic Silver Medalist is the eighth.
When it came to the tip, the crash didn't have much effect.
Friday is an important day when you have to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things That Science Says Will Extend Your Age
Science has studied everything that is possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health in such a way that his or her life lengthens.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence can bring them extra years.
These include a tendency to medium body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can increase your age.
You don't always have to waste your time - just picking up a milk can is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through a variety of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated — with a reduced risk of death — especially with neurological or heart-related diseases.
Again, studies suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of floss can extend a person’s life by more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live when the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity will bring additional years, there is no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require an absolute slenderness.
One Oxford University study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it’s an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who won the Olympic Games, he’s more likely to live longer than a regular blizzard.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his or her life to an extra year.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long life is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible, for example, to pursue confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over the age of 65 found that a person shopping on a daily basis was likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is due to the fact that spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk drunk driver crashed into a truck.
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car accident occurred in Kosken, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred at Koskentie, midway between Koskentie and Torvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came in was drifting into the lane at the same time, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck stood up in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into a ditch and then across the ditch to the roof.
A woman, born in 1972, who carried a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Post office sent loose candy to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in the selection of bulk candy at the K-Citymarket in Salo, because the post office had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernio, was shopping for loose candy at the K-Citymarket in Salo on Thursday, when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If there was no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Mowering is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with a blizzard.
Media representatives have also been calling all along, and the attention this has caused is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to catch her favorites in a loose candy bag, even though a few pieces were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti’s Corporate Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomit.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do a partial delivery (Salo) with three, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomit.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not annoyed by the sign, because she found all her own candy favourites in the selection.
30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund posted a photo of her change
The comedian producer has lost dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of photos of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract already in 2009.
She has undergone a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has collected a number of praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We’re on the same journey, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures while I’m on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then about 10 kg.
During the three-month period, the kilos eventually fell by five.
Desire for the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and petitiones with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinarian Station as a substitute and also completed her nursing training there.
Veterinarians remember women with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and unafraid of work.
My good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisa, Koskenkylä.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Press that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation during the arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
District Court Sentences Post to Violation of Equality Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of the employee who refused to train the temporary agency worker, estimates Kanta-Häme District Court in its judgment.
The district court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the employee’s salary, which corresponded to the part of the orientation in the whole day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU on the prohibition of induction.
During the November postal strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin sacks head of his administration - Estonian-based Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has sacked President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
The farm will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino as his replacement, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2012 before Putin was re-elected.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition ban - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record for football transfers is not seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off over the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition, Paul Pogba, is sidelined due to a ban as ManU opens its league season Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game as Pogba was suspended from playing from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-match ban.
That ban has been moved to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam play is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, grandiose madness is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starring top artists in the world.
Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
Festivalists have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The event area of Flow Festival will be styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind the success is: What kind of event would the perpetrators want to go to?
It is quite unusual for events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 last year by 5,000 people.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle that is controlled by huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink kibars in the partly artificial turf area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage performances, 15,000 people’s tent will serve as a venue this year.
He admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little magnanimous, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done on the rock is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activities were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can also be used to produce —creasing things — such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
Along with the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to be distinguished by content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen on a show in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's done some damn good shows in recent years.
Thailand tourist paradise bombs hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra said.
Since 1989, Asian wildlife patron Edwin Wiek tweeted a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, even favored by Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack took place in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say the bombings are likely to result in insurgent troops who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been involved in the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will go into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat duties only after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat in the war situation.
According to the Head of Education, the first assignment to the service is to be made by reserve personnel belonging to the standby forces.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to a task for which the required training has not been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts in units of immediate readiness from next year onwards.
Units can be used for military operations, if necessary, already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from the home house
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused hazardous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell their apartment in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld a district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the couple a total of EUR 47,344 for the trial and settlement costs.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already known some of the need to repair the apartment when they made the purchase.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the apparent building errors were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola is looking for a good home
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had been looking specifically for a good-looking home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the matters mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwater from the rock should be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, were caused by both rock rain waters and land humidity that had risen capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, the microbial-infested air was estimated by the inspector to have reached the interior via the porch as well.
Mold or yeast exceeding health risks were found in brush samples in the home care room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window marker and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that the apartment had been changed in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not feel that the Court of Appeal had any particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
A creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finnish in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States have microfilm records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the race agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency served under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out on women to investigate the issue.
The Race Bureau investigated women’s backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The goal was to make sure there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten biography and good recommendations from close friends.
The Race Agency wanted assurances that women were —children’s lovers — sparing and —good National Socialists — who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum website.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported the reception of children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between Aryans and non-Aryans were prohibited by law.
On the sixth of Siren, Nirkko rose and fell

Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded during a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so hungover”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship bartender to a 1995 tango king, Finland’s best-selling solo artist, and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still in the middle of her journey and is currently in a frenzy.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of his favorite singer, was published today Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a total climb as he won the Tango King's crown at the Tango market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hung over!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
The recording of the song, which became a huge hit, would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the mark was still good.
I learned that all the time you don’t have to insist on being perfect and perfect.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up with texts from the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but was written based on the news of the 7-day magazine.
The newspaper reported that Jari and his ex-lover were the cause of the divorce, but Jari said that it was a complete nonsense and that it was not true.
Jari played the book in a rage at the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of voters supported the difference and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although polls during the voting week were predicting the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the resignation, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, “It’s the economy, stupid” flew to the scrap booth in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial Curly Language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in its latest monthly survey provides professional answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on grounds other than economics.
One of the economists’ explanations for the loss of economic status is that people don’t understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed people, that is, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real British.
Many also believe that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently raised.
They were particularly challenged by the fairness of the BBC, which gave as much space to economists representing only a couple of percent of the economists who supported the EU withdrawal as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hosted press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic combinations of capital letters are about the consequences of the difference.
Those distant letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with which the voters feel they have no common interests.
Academics in large cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message was not working.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit referendum was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will congest your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would real British children get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have given the British more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and particularly EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up A and B plans.
Plan B, or the victory of a camp that supports the withdrawal from the EU, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid funds, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets,\" Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily quoted real estate fund, which was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund at the time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the camp that supported the withdrawal from the EU won, Europe went crazy.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimates that Brexit can be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
These together looted the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to pull money out in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the report.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks,” Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of queries.
Reasonable attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate fund trades received undue attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK real estate.
Aberdeen's shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed for 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been raved downwards, but the situation does not seem to Aberdeen’s point of view — ferocious —
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings cons to the real estate market in London
At 2 a.m., the situation didn’t look too good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate manager at Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word of power.
I realized that this is now going to plan B,” Vanhanen says in her second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was still alive in the morning.
The normally silent TV screens at the office were buzzing with the news, and usually the loud crowds were completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning that you never thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company had prepared for the alternative well, and that is why the situation was kind of calm,” Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote starts correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went to exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the UK and especially in the London real estate market.
In the coming years, the London office premises were expected to have a 20% reduction.
Soon, a group of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still raging in the air.
However, it does not appear on the face of Vanhanen who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first reported.
The real estate service company CBRE’s data on price developments covers approximately one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures in just five months, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops occurred during the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The comparison is not quite correct, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity,” Vanhanen says.
Funding is available normally.
There could have been a repair anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him - it could have been there without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world-leading cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have increased for four reasons.
Britain’s economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will become globalized,” Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt lever has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Divide, Divide
In London, prices increased last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change, and now it has come.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any spike in elevations.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady going on ahead.
Vanhanen has seen more moves up and down as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still, he's an optimist who believes that the pit can be overcome with work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are decentralized, says Vanhanen.
S Group begins to register shopping information in more detail
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will start collecting even more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
When data on the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will start to collect it on the products purchased at the beginning of May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the consent of the customer and is used under license for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Talousanom.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in the registration of S Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers according to food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not currently planning one.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valitatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product level information, we remain at the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K-Group or S-Group,” says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product data will be registered.
First experiment
So far, SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address information, the basic information also includes occupation, education, type of residence, the birth years of the children and previous personal data.
The members of the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The S-Etukortti purchase includes the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method.
In addition, the information of S-bonus partners is derived from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terroi and ABC-chains, data is currently recorded at the product group level.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more accurately,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in piles anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your saved data on S Group’s website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador’s puppy is actively sniffing five similar boxes placed in a row at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her dog Heila to play with her favorite toy.
From the box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of powder gas resounding shells.
Ruutigas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened,” says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector General of Customs.
Another main reason for training the weapons and explosives dog for Customs' duties are postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
With the increase in internet sales, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made approximately 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, among the online shop purchases, passenger plane luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and postal items.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research,” says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits the police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport include Customs’ six drug dogs and Massi’s money and drug dog.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as tranquility, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close co-worker with the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be done without him at home, he laughs.
Subtle orders will reach Heila from a one-time coat.
The cameraman of the evening-sanomat loses the camera mic cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns a cover that looks like a soft toy from the immediate-loose command.
Tough Competition for Working Dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, next October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work bra, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work only lasts from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is fierce competition at Customs.
Heila’s owner applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and supervision tasks at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than one million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrates championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finale in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game connected our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard they were encouraging,\" said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer faints after fierce performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard fight.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one really knows why.
Tokola received 175 kg for the push in Rio and 145 kg for the stunt.
His combined score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push at the last 175 kilos, as did his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with fierce roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and a threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 players.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative,” RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Next Next post: The Brave Modern Family Star Reveals Nearly Everything
Ariel Winter, familiar with Alex Dunphy as the kindest character in the modern family comedy series, reprises by showing off her daring body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior considerably more courageous.
The star has posed in pictures posted on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce costumes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently released several photos of himself celebrating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a —typical Hollywood transformation — from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show a exposed surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his longtime fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the decline is already so severe,” says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman gleams.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured to northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror Aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start their northern lights journeys in early autumn,” Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main tourist attractions of the Japanese Northern Lights are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the hallmarks of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early autumn and continues long into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake’s surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times more fairytale,” says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are lured to Finland with online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and the University of Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to have clearer unique sights in Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have enormous potential, according to Lindi.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain was forced to settle for silver in rugby 7 race when Fiji's champion team won gold
Great Britain's impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was crushed by Fiji's victory on Thursday in the finals played at Rio's Deodoro Stadium, in numbers 43-1.
Fiji gave the champions a lesson in ball handling, moves, side diversions, support game, running lines and brutal force, and thus won gold - if it was the first Olympic medal in its history for the country.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly leaner consolation for Britain as it was the third silver in the country on the same day. They can be proud of their success in the first-time rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win over the South African Boxes in numbers 7 to 10 in the semi-final earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full force.
It may bring comfort to Great Britain that at least one British will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Ben Ryan, Fiji head coach, former English rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
It has been a great experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's coaching at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji started off excellently and presented their tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It looked as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had come across a group of moving buses, and the world champions took the 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a plunge into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
The situation between 12 and 0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the rocky Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, after which Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal from a further start, leaving more than a minute of play in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then plunged through the even more powerful tackles of the UK team and crashed over the goal line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended in situation 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British still play the role of apprentice.
Which is very much true.
The UK made major changes in the half-time and managed to hold the Fijians for a whole four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored the goal thanks to the Fijians' excellent team game.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation down to 36 to 15 by scoring a goal for Britain at the left corner, but the game was long lost to the South Sea archipelagoers, whose fans in the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji’s pure joyous attitude.
Mata Viliame made a final touch on the Fijian cake by scoring in the final moments.
The straw rang, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won in Japan's semi-finals by 20-20 and Great Britain had passed South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the balance was settled by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed from under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson, a 15-player rugby team player in England, sealed the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
There could be no more emotional gold in these games.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 winning bets on history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the oars were the two, the third in the boat echoed the voice of coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's duo. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was 39th consecutive and once again record-breaking to them.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the water surface like swans to age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has taken the two towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know then whether he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tough at the time.
“I had bladder cancer and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes my mind a little...
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky enough that Williams was able to start his treatment outside of the sport's high season in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say in such circumstances as this.
“I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger -
Immediately after the victory, the duo's thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and spoke a little more than normal in an attempt to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: “On the emotional level, I’ve been in ruins this week, which may be a bit extreme, but it means so much —
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash register has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm for which their competitors have failed to match.
Even on the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish duo began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
We were very close in an instant.
Helen Hoki - Stay with me, stay with me -
It's very important not to drift off the route...
“We were very successful in leaving, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything amazing.
We didn’t seek the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did.
The two think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates next month with Steve Backshall, who is known for TV nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure...
“After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed out.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
It feels so much better, he says.
Iceland to change government over Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama data leaks called for as early as spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential election clearly showed criticality to those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, a candidate from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest tweets.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be involved in the creation of the organization by the founder and Democratic candidate of the terrorist organization ISIS, Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to sink so low as the commander-in-chief of the army,” Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim-popular burkini swimsuits from being worn at beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which broadly express religious affiliations, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two men linked to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - Pyykösjärvi
The water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae has been detected on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the operational limits set out in the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal concentrations of the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the limits of the procedures.
The blue algae cloud observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, causing the surface of the water to form blue-green algae mass as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation with frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae precipitation turns into blue-green algae bloom, it will also be announced separately on the notice board of the beach.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest farm size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational changes in forest holdings is good,” comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticism of the tax reform proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM proposal starts with a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry to prevent a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would gain tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The limit on the tax deduction linked to the value of forest income is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high, according to Hakkarainen.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
At VM, it is considered that the limit guarantees the goal of increasing the space size.
In forest policy, forest gift deductions have been taken decades, according to Hakkarainen.
This is due to the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.

According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive runs of the car plunged into a ditch, after which the person behind him crashed ahead of him.
On-call firefighter Harri Pyyhtiä says that the derailment in the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
The car behind him had two people, both being transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research findings from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivanska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in Nature Communications, a respected journal in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home murder continues at court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for other perpetrators
Muhos's family home killing continues in court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years for 4 months, including killing as a young person and aggravated robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and of transporting a vehicle without the right as a young person.
The judgment of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lower sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for a murder committed as a young person.
At the time, they were in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit at a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked the director from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had gotten out of the grip and led the young man into his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a mental examination, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had been planning an escape from a family home since at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, increasing only at the age of 156
Ice sharks have been confirmed to be the longest living vertebrate in the world, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, or vaulter, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of clam is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although a throw in one direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an Economic Wiseman - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
As much as a third of all government tax revenues would not be received if the change in corporate tax driven by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of money, $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the state of excessive regulation of business and of bankrupting small businesses.
The decided environmental standards of the emergency must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector must be abolished.
Barack Obama’s healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed — experts instead of bureaucrats —
Trade policy is one of the main causes of the United States’ problems.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
A 45 % penalty tax would be imposed on imports from China and a 35 % penalty tax would be imposed on Mexico.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will monitor the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his manners, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early Friday.
A wave from the past - People's News
The sea dies fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street buzz - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of the novel story of Pedro Almodóvar.
Almodovar's previous directing work The Travel Lovers (2013) was a mini-funny and Ronski-side satirical comedy, the pre-existing Skin in which I live the peaks of my Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between the two works.
It is a serene love, interpersonal and family drama of the conventional, with a mother-daughter relationship at its core.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She starts from the time before her daughter's birth, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta’s young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, is cast in the second female lead, from the television series “The Time Between Ommelte” (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a slump, but I’d say that it’s pretty much a one-time wipe.
Almodóvar films are often so characteristic of flashiness, all the way down to humor in Julieta there is a fair distance.
It is an evenly portrayed, restrained, place in some places with good music and quite saddened film, which as such contains elements of its elegia.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there, and so that it slowly begins to stick to the eye as a pure form rather than a functioning dramatic power tool.
The characters of the film are plagued by diseases, deaths or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is to say, the tunes of the scene in question, are not improved.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Canadian author Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in 2013.
The novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unparalleled for even more intense drama, and so much of the big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12 August.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No further cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made by a bunch of people.
There will be no further cuts.
The four-billion-dollar savings that have already been decided on will be sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (kok.) say under the budget discussion.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits meeting.
Child benefit, national pension, basic security of unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training cuts continue.
Townships are haunting
Why do the ministers insist so strongly that no further cuts will be made to them?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections will be held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result in different directions of the government parties spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallupit says, however, that the party expects the Finns Party of Finland to lose their share, although the result of its previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, much of which will be realised by the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeblood of the government of three parties, about as large as the one of them, depends on the ability of the Finns Party to live.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also surfaced.
The first thing that is obscured by new cuts is the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and the second is to soften the expected strike on the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the target of indebtedness being reversed during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal takes on EUR 5.9 billion of debt next year, or more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget run-up.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018, and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will receive what is to come.
These measures do not reduce debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not stop debt even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it incontrovertibly:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no help from the international economy.
Finland’s national economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except during the resuscitation policy pursued temporarily in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and lengthened from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: A lot of tasks to be left to the municipality
Three out of four believe that organizing children’s day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also rolls responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, the province is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the duties of the municipalities in charge of the order are to be transferred to the state.
A young drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu ran a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie on Friday night at 1:30 a.m.
A police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man went on to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from there to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed cop ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver’s license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a pile of rocks crashed into a ditch.
A truck on a rock cargo crashed into a ditch on Kölvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9.15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The emergency services lifted the injured driver out of the truck through the door above the fallen truck, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the car owner.
Hydraulic oil was poured into the road from the crashed truck, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahti, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a tall, slender, well-groomed woman with white hair that stretches under her chin.
Observations and hints of lost movements are requested to call the call number of the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The surge that crashed the tents at the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially on its feet, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the end of Friday night in the marketplace.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances in the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The downward flow is generated in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its speed towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the plunges.
The rush flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people slightly injured themselves.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for further treatment.
Air Pollution Ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin ageing is air pollution.
The study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzed London’s air’s most toxic fine particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, say, a fellow person living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who travel their commuting commuting near crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution with different masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After getting out of the tractor and going in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor managed to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor did not run further, as it collided with the rocks in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, leaves for the series starting in October for better starting points than for the memory of men.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach at Rienno, praises the new team as an enterprising and united team.
Fred Musoni, a middleman of the foreign trio, begins his second season at Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson, aged 23, and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is similarly a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and Riverboys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all the World Floorball Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is in Tampere, only 2013 missed Canada’s better finish in the North American qualification.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up the National Floorball Team.
I was interested and here I am, 48, says Jumppanen.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played on the Finnish Floorball level.
The show was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship series 1991-92 with the university, the following three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, the balance was 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The most recent season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, an uncle-oriented Finnish gymball club, were raised by Josba, who was selected to join the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.

The head coach of the national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley champion Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach volleyball championships will be decided on the weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in both adult and young leagues.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs of each series rank will be qualified for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäe’s YMCA-grown Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball summit for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to watch this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena in the baseball stadium.
I haven’t played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark in sports and gave good snacks to a great hobby.
There are memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine in the E-girls of the Elimäe YMCA.
On top of that, there is an oversized jersey, knee pads rotating on the ankles, as well as huge aces and choreographs after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the action - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the club's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior age.
The swimming pool has been playing biscuit since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the Juniors Championships, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu is playing together with the kick-starter Anniina Parkkinen at the Finnish Championship Finals during the weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-gold we are still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament in Kisakallio.
At least the toe shoes are temporarily put on the nail, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started working as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into the hand of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always loved working on a farm, and now that I’ve started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into play.
If you start something, you have to do it properly and seriously.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I was very brave to join the project and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would still turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli’s goal is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has produced results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for young food producers in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be eligible to vote on the newspaper's website until August 21.

The average annual inflation rate measured by the CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
Compared to June 2016, the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 per cent compared to December 2015 per cent) has been -0.2 per cent, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 per cent.

Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s anime effect is criticized as an Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers think it is racist.
Snapchat’s lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lentils are unblemished, features-distorting tools that create over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized for favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it provided some of its users this week with a filter that turned their eyes crooked, distorted their teeth, and made their cheeks chubby, some reviewers called it a racist caricature of Asian people — yellowface.
Critics also wondered if these recurring conflicts referred to the greater problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and was written by e-publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said they had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some strongly denied the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets about the images were widely shared, said in her email that the lens was -- at least offensive and embarrassing --
He adds: “It’s hard to deny the comparison of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just — yellowface — but one taken to a derogatory extreme —
Snapchat is not the only company that must avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s general audience consists of young people who are more diverse from their ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This can mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, things like this no longer go unnoticed as they were before,” Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday.
As Product Manager and Designer, Zhu, working on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In a medium article and telephone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticizes the company's leadership, which consists mostly of white men and men alone, and concludes his writings with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that there are no people of color in their one-sided staff, so they can make decisions like this, or they have people of color as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily,” Zhu, a Chinese-American, said in a statement.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK —
Congressional expert group says military officials tampered with intelligence on ISIS
A congressional expert group released a report on Thursday that officials from the U.S. Armed Forces, the Central Command, altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what events in the field gave reason to understand.
The Republican Chairs of the House Armed Services Committee for Intelligence and Defence Resources set up a working group, which reports in an interim report on the intelligence analysts of the armed forces — general dissatisfaction — according to analysts, senior military officials embellished their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, briefly Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
\"The intelligence results, which were approved by the senior leaders of Centcom, generally gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism actions than the facts on the ground, and were invariably more positive than in other intelligence community units' analyses,\" the report said in a press release.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable — our soldiers are suffering when high-level policy makers are presented with false analyses,” California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said in a statement.
The errors at Centcom’s management level extend to the top level of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems that emerged in 2014 and 2015 with descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by Obama's administration have been faked, it gives an image of analysts that suggests that Centcom leaders have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were much more positive than the events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a large military raid to recapture Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
“After months of research, this is very clear,” Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders of the U.S. armed forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about the suspicions by analysts that intelligence about ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, follows more detailed results, as the studies continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were in part consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to assess intelligence about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat in the committee.
According to Schiff, this process — delayed the publication of intelligence results, — violated the morale of analysts — and — paid insufficient attention to divergent views —
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to a predestined or political official line —
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon Superintendent, which began as a result of lawsuits by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesperson, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: “Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues.”
The investigation has other repercussions, in addition to seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by an increasing number of defence authorities).
However, the allegations made last year cast doubt on how much President Obama can rely on Central Command and its honest assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence about ISIS responds to disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that the government of President George W. Bush, despite protests from many analysts, only supported small troops in Iraq and spent little time reflecting on what would follow from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection on intelligence about ISIS.
According to authorities, last year the Hooker team concluded that despite opposing public statements, air strikes at ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries and thus was able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not transmitted outside Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators had judged the testimony given to the Senate to have been too positive reviews of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel, Commander of the Central Command.
United States wins fourth duel in women's field hockey and stabilizes its position for confrontation with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning, goaliest 6-to-1 decided game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
I have no idea, he says.
I'm not one of those people who keeps track of the goals they've scored.
However, he knows this: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournaments and lost zero games and share the first place in their group with Britain, which continued its winning streak while winning on Thursday in Japanese numbers 2-0.
Britain and the United States will play against each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final, which determines which of them will be the first of the six teams to form the group and which of them will be the second.
The first-placer avoids long-term encounters with the hard-held Dutch team who won the second block.
Despite what happens in Saturday's game, Americans have already raised a buzz over their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first caught a field hockey bat at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel). He entered the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player ever.
The 2008 Olympic Games missed him when he did not make it to the final player list.
Then came the 2012 races, where he and his team had little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an English coach, was appointed, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, mental and physical,” Bam said.
“Our work pace in London was not as it is now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close by with a knuckle bump in.
India had entered the game without any tournament wins, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained the 1-0 status until the third episode, when Bam entered the field.
Bam long carried the ball along the left side of the field, squirmed to the middle field, hit the ball in the goal, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored her final goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first in the tournament in which the United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had one hit in each.
Briggs is now living his season of success,
Just like Bam.
“Our investment is now good,” says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the middle of the Olympic Hulina, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics will inevitably happen.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself was a flaming baton that moves from archer to swimmer, swimmer to gymnast, and gymnast to triathlonist.
You can’t turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in line for a coffee shop without missing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or a dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first-time Olympic Dooley charms with his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and be in the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good-mind TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast, or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on the trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are less well-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I want to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so low that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
Of course, athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never made it to the medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side, the medals have been attended by Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because in an uncivilized ear, it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for an Olympics.
(I feel like I’m not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comic potential, which in cartoon films has been used endlessly by characters in constant bouncing scenes. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swim jumping, that is, species that combine in the trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means -a springboard -
Ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline, which ejects them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged based on performance, difficulty and flight time.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnastics, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common course of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
When pursuing gold, medals must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to a goalline or a starting wall, they also have another goal they seek in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This purposeful pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and even enough to bring the viewer into tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just for watching the games.
This trampoline offers a respite.
In Trampoline, the direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up as weightless as an astronaut, falls down and swings back up effortlessly.
Of course, the sport also includes a competitive aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a fierce rush to the goal or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only an Olympic competition can get.
Women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1 p.m. local time and men's matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, starting at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the midst of Olympiamania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment, which, in the midst of a common bustle, might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes and objectifying them — as the U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his bloating new fan base.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Eyewitnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally of the West whose economy has grown rapidly.
Over the past few months, however, anti-government protests have shaken the country, which are spreading to increasingly wider regions.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
Eyewitnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos of the protests, presumably at the end of last year or early this year, show how the security forces are hitting young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights official is now demanding a thorough investigation.
“Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is all the more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, director of research at the International Crisis Group of the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if any, will receive this much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, with the capital Addis Ababa even having a new urban train.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from the model country of democracy; human rights organisations have consistently reported on the repressive policies of the government, the opposition in the country is very limited, and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven into the desert.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to protest, it will erupt out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
An entire generation protested.
There are many topics of discontent, ranging from land use to the strangulation of the government coalition from power.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last place that belonged to the opposition before, and as a result, they now dominate the whole Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing along the Eritrean border, where the escalating situation claimed hundreds of deaths in the June battle.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been simmering under the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only for the last couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many still access the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations of Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amharas.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
Amhars from the predominantly Christian Highlands of Ethiopia have long dominated the country's politics and business and deprived of the oromas, most of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this is also changing.
“Collaboration is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigren tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet dominates the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who conciliated between the opposing parties.
“Today’s government lacks this essential instinct,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes almost without knowing.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time similar riots took place in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, were first screwed up and then stolen by the government.
In post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though fewer were killed than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for forward-thinking infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from intensifying.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the Amhara city of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more common on social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighbouring Somalia, but the base has recently been shut down, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
“This requires a tight balance,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
Donald J. Trump tried to withdraw his words on Friday in the latest controversy over his campaign, claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions on the Republican side about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in a tempting situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments he might not have meant.
Trump made the claim at an election event on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the President and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
But early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump made a full tweet about the day before, when he said he was serious about his accusations in several interviews.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obamahan was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off his claim.
The latest storm of criticism rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their economic policy line speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton's speech was boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, \"Of course, I was sarcastic.\"
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and — to clarify — in one way or another, depending on the reactions — says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they are round enough to penetrate different sieves.
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more punctuated as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist, published on Friday, reported that Trump's support is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while in Florida, the situation is tightly balanced.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But having become increasingly vigilant in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I consider his statements to be a reasoned, political speech,” Giuliani said when he was asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama mistakenly called — the lower-series team — and that’s why he pulled the troops out of Iraq,” he said.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it did not take decisive action in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of vexing his speeches and discriminating attitude towards him.
He ridiculed —unnecessary and pathetic — television commentators who try to find out about him, but he says they can’t do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, saying it just showed more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
Coffee shop closed due to an unreasonable rent increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a snotty café in Williamsburg, where only cash was accepted and where there was no Wi-Fi, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its streetside spot on Bedford Avenue when the rent became disproportionate.
Soap Cherie, which came to replace Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals find this loss of a café that has been avoided under the middle class to be sad.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is changing, I know, but I still can’t believe there’s no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store.”
But even though New York is no longer the same, new ones are being created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unattractive.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and chief of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he also wanted to try something new.
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches available and capers and browned onion rings to fill.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
There is no more beer in the café, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After nine months in the café, Rodriguez says he noticed that the old standard customers had begun to visit the Verb as a steady stream.
“Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he said.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently went to the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verb in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized I like Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a new item on the list.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the café before work and ordered the same without exception.
“I walked into a coffee shop every day for 15 minutes, like a machine, and there they already made my butterbagel with all the fillings,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from his bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge that the soap store took the old place.
Soap Cherie's owners even offered to make a special soap for which Verb's own cold-brewed coffee is used.
“We may still take the offer,” Rodriguez said.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the coffee at the café.
The café may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the cafe was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like coming home,” Whitt said.
I needed the smell of coffee.
The Dark Food of the Great Depression in A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office at the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as the Culinary Cross, was fond of the luxurious cuisine of restaurants on Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
That day his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dessert from plum pudding.
“It was a manifestation of culinary solidarity for people suffering,” Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds: “It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat —
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, titled 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new co-author is A Square Meal, published Tuesday by Harper, describing the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when agreeing to be a meeting place with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year as the major stock market crash occurred in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, on the other hand, ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a reporter ordered a meatloaf, the couple said it would fit well into a conversation about eating a large depression.
“The crumbs were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
People ate peanut cereal, liver loaf and bean loaf.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal.
Andrew Coe is mocking.
“It must have hit the stomach like lead,” he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American Dining Table, especially in the countryside, worked on the buffet principle - eat as much as you like -
Women made food for agricultural workers, and fresh fried pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
“This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, mysterious dishes such as crumbs and stews became the main food, and stews were called —a great way to take advantage of food residue — because chefs could cover up not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The flesh, which for years had been the central part of the American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, where the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman produced oven bulbs filled with peanut butter used as a pula-time dish.
“It didn’t get any popularity at the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman added: “It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion are not at all compatible.
This was characteristic of many household recipes -
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget managers and to meet the challenge of making tasty dishes like carrot-creamspaget.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the reaction of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s — let me eat cake — attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, as a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman he had become.
“He liked continental European cuisine, such as fish and cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As reported in the book, while Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the dishes served in the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst made —
Many of the food in the recession was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
As they write the book, the couple says they’ve begun to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she couldn’t throw away food.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away,” Coe said.
“People even started to get sick of his food,” recalls Ziegelman.
For example, once on the wind caps...
After the main dishes were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they made at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
“It’s called plum foam,” says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We simmered our spoons reluctantly into a thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe did it a second time and a third time.
“German nuts would make this better,” Coe said to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
Full compensation to Gilead for attorney fees for patent dispute over hepatitis C drug with Merck
A judge at the U.S. Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for legal fees incurred by it for the patent dispute over the hepatitis C medicinal product with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released for damages of $200 million for violating two Merck-owned patents related to Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni successful drugs, a US judge found Merck committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a Thursday’s action, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to an exemption from the attorney’s fees that it incurred in defending the case.
Merck tries to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in Gilead’s medicines.
U.S.-backed forces have taken Manbij city from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have captured the city of Manjib in northern Syria, near the Turkish border, when the last ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now raking into the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
A spokesman for the Manbij Military Council of the SDF, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still conducting search operations,” Darwish said.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced on Friday her 2015 tax return showing that her and her husband's income at the time was $10.75 million and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned almost $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, formerly Secretary of State, announced that she had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book, which covered her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's Vice Presidential Candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set a model for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
As usual, U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax records public, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to the Tax Administration for an inspection and call it the reason why Trump has not released his income information.
The transfer is yours — tweeted by Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax records.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Court Assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release his tax records until the checks are complete.
Trump critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to release the information raises questions about Trump's equity, his grants to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has addressed this issue and posted a video online on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release his tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades and does not publicize his tax returns,” Clinton said.
According to the Politico online newspaper, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax attorneys and auditors on Friday that the situation could still be similar.
Federal tax rates have become a central issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a bill named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, headquartered in the same location as Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says he has also been subject to an audit by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was earned.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported the sum of dividend and interest income at $109,000.

Chili powdered elk condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from the human settlement —the elephants are harassed by throwing chili powder-filled condoms at them.
The initiative has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has, together with the U.S. Nature Conservation organization, launched a campaign to teach volunteers from the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as now the villagers can be confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, an intrusive elephant is struck by pointing a flashlight and ringing a horn.
If this does not work, the so-called chili cloud is thrown.
The mixed chili powder of the soil is put in the condom together with the firecracker, after which the end of the condom is twisted so that only the ignition thread is left outside.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spice is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last resort is a thrower that shoots a firework known as a Roman candle into the air and gives rise to a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israel's area code from Arab call to call for 'RT News'
A French, Jewish film director with roots gave birth to a media raid after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel's area code in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the holocaust document Shoah, dissipated his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among countries where the room can be called directly.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed, as if it did not exist?
Lanzmann writes.
Kempinski Bristol, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation of the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was — a carefully considered decision by the management of Kempinski hotels —
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s area code.
Israeli ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the incident a “great disgrace”
The incident shocks and shocks us all.
It's a shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Death” was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called the incident a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
A direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never issued — writes a spokesperson for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel said.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets to protest Brazilian students
Students clashed with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to protest against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement officers attempted to disperse a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to show their dismay at the government's plans.
Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the state of Sao Paulo, has proposed a austerity measure to close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, temporarily opposing Michel Temer, who held the presidency.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with protesters supporting the dismissed President Dilma Rousseff, with the country's Senate voting on the impeachment charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the departure of the sanctions, the annual trade trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
He said Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
“Russian companies continue to maintain existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further growth in trade is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries, says Dzhagaryan.
In the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
Russia’s exports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“Last year, Russia’s foreign mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
For the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to visit Russia.
And it’s not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
Scots Callum Skinner reached the finish line when British people won the Gold of Cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland ran a reputation at the men's team print at the Rio velodrome last night when the UK trio defended the 2012 London-deserved championship.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow played the anchor role he inherited from his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy from Scotland. The young man made the legend proud as he ran to the finish line and won the victory from a New Zealand team considered to be a favorite.
Britain took a surprise win four years ago when Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after they had finished only sixth at the World Rally Championships in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialises in the first lead role.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scottish Skinner was a man that British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy, won the championship four years ago Kenny and Skinner set an Olympic record in the time run, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British three won gold in a duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow the pace with a larger gear, allowing Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they entered the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says: “I’m flattered by the parallel.
I’m just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to having crashed on purpose due to a bad departure.
He later withdrew his word, and British rivals had no appeal.
This time, there were no such problems with sovereign victory.
Hindes says: “The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, you will have a successful five-day velodrome ahead.
As Kenny has shown by his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean an increase in the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next competing in a sprint that starts today and is resolved in three days.
At 28 years old Kenny from Bolton says, \"At this moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the win with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely.
Hindes says, \"If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the knight's rank.\"
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team race.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record made in London in 2012 for winning gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 22:42 p.m.) will be held today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
He had a dispute with rivals yesterday before the time run when the officials invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now rely on its great track cycling team to take over the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a host of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is not the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April, amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton's racing careers.
However, competitions held on the first night at the velodrome show that the UK’s already legendary reputation to rise to the top at a perfect moment will be realized once again.
The future of Portland's smelter at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of employees are at stake when a power company supplying electricity to the smelter said that one of the plant's owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian Government's decision earlier this year not to extend the subsidies to keep the factory in operation.
Fixed, 20-year aid will cease in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs are in danger of disappearing from the Alcoa Portland plant.
As a result of redundancies, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's smelter is losing money and is at risk of having to close its doors.
The measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects that three other owners of the smelter will also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares of the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
AGL says that the contracts are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
“AGL therefore expects the agreements to generate revenue in the financial year 2017- says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million — as a forecast for contract termination —
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts does not affect Alcoa ... the capacity to keep the smelter in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the smelter.
The American company said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force as of November this year, although it still needs to figure out why it has now backed out of the deal.
Due to the weak economic situation in the industry, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both a smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and a Tomo factory near Newcastle.
AGL’s Chief Operating Officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity on an annual basis and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
“If these factories leave the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand (electricity) in the market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news, says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality television star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
A model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is the advertising face of Estee Lauder and appeared at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at the cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover image was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just a Kardashian-series style-fitting?), a screenplay featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashian show producer Ryan Seacrest) showing that they forgot their sister's cover photo. The video ends with a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichéd and is used in almost every birthday episode of the ascension programs (Seacrest states the words: “Do you think we had forgotten you — as sincerely as the children’s morning TV cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
For the appearance of Vogue in the September issue undoubtedly marks a new era of the Kardashians.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover before (she appeared on Vogue's cover along with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite her own class.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release in a year.
A number more thick than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (a fashion site from Fashionista calculated that last year’s 832-page opus had 615 pages of advertisements).
The release of the September issue's cover star is so eagerly expected that, in the previous two years, the magazine's images have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
The cover models for September include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has featured celebrities who work in the model rather than models who are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model of his generation, and even if he would rather be among the famous people who work on the model, he is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, reality TV stars, or children of modern times who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared in the cover last year, is behind one of the strongest years of his career, when he released his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Because of his true TV background, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be inconvenient.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them -- bitches --
These feelings have resurfaced when news of Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover came out.
However, the constant feeling of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking through Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She is the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
She and all her sisters sell photos of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she filmed for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable position in the country are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in appropriations will have on centres already at an extreme level.
Three out of five people who apply for free legal aid and legal services in the state of Queensland are already turned away — most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions, and similar injustices against fighting people without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres every year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they seek the necessary services they need,” Farrell said.
“People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unjustified redundancies — all of them have problems with legal issues, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued after no action was supposedly taken after its management was informed that the North Carolina leader of the campaign had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action filed Wednesday by former state campaign software instructor Vincent Bordini at the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before, in his own words, he realized that this was not going to happen.
In his lawsuit, Bordini says campaign leader Earl Phillip -- brought out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and put a pipe in Vincent's kneecap --
According to the action, after making a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
“Even if the gun is not fired, it will cause damage,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The action comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused general outrage when he told the crowd in North Carolina that — the supporters of the second additional section — who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, wins the election and is allowed to elect the judges.
Trump’s campaign staff said the media removed his words from context and Trump did not encourage violence.
In his action, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifferent conduct and Phillip for assault, assault, and the emotional suffering they cause.
Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks did not immediately reply to a message asking for a comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call request submitted to Phillip’s consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates well-being — not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the thing that was most interesting in Heathrow, as at the 2012 London Olympics, we invested enormously in the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the surrounding areas of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and to grow the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and employment both to the airport environment and to the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, which included a T5 terminal — which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years — and a T2 terminal built in the middle of two of the world’s busiest runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for Heathrow's expansion so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the board of Heathrow and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad-block in cat-mouse games
Attempts by businesses making money from online advertising to distract ad-blocking software have turned into cat-mouse play, says one company producing blockchain programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking anti-advertising programs, Adblock Plus posted a blog post where it told users that they could update their anti-blocking software filters and thus again block social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad labeling codes on its desktop site so that it would be harder for ad-blocking programs to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock now says it has cleared the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that “such a ballballing between an open source ad-blocking community and diversions has been going on since the ad-blocking was invented — and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own correction move again.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern the ad-blockers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising programs, according to a survey conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has almost quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading anti-advertising programs in its desktop app, as the spokesperson says that mobile ad blockers won’t work on Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it was updating the ad tool for user settings so users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, as it also said they would prevent some regular Facebook posts from appearing.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.
“Advertising programs are clumsy and ineffective, and that’s why we’ve instead invested in developing user settings like advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves.”
Woman commits suicide by being hit by cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking witnesses for help on the freeway in the first hours of Thursday's accident, in which a woman deliberately fell victim to several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate thing by laying down on a dark road, and she was hit by more than one car, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman with a clear intention of committing suicide, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified. The police ask them or other witnesses to report.
Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, reports in the Le Tribune de Geneva newspaper that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in such a situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be prosecuted.
Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to investigate, says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, two similar cases have occurred, on the basis of which motorists are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to bump into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was acquitted of the charge that had been brought against him from the death penalty after he collided with a man who was lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court held that the driving method of the police, which was responding to the emergency call, was justified and that the man lying on the road was a completely exceptional and unforeseen situation.
Anyone who knows anything about the accident near Morges on Thursday will be asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
NASA's new climate model estimates that Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was intended to determine whether conditions on Venus could sometimes have been similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and waterless on the surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to the researchers' previous presentations, Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and has, nevertheless, rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet likely had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent fainter.
In the GISS modeling, Venus spins slowly and its day side is toward the sun for almost two months at a time, according to GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and creates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the Earth.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the earlier assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned vaporized water.
In the karate of hydrogen, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect remained in space, i.e. Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modeling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from his positions as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the club's hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado vice president/general Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start seeking a new coach.
“For the past three years, I’ve done my job as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the club’s hockey operations with vigor, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the club's ice hockey manager must be fully in line with the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met -
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakic said.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made a further season in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the 2015-2016 season and was five points away from Minnesota Wild when playing from another Wild Card slot at a western conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talks and halt strike
Chief negotiators report that the North Sea oil workers' wage strikes will be interrupted as all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against the oilfield services company Wood Group on drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, the Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute.
As of the beginning of next week, we will be holding several full-day meetings in the coming weeks to address the problems of recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut around 9% of its North Sea contractors’ tariffs this year.
The reduction in the company’s tariffs follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in countries in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it room for manoeuvre that is necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus seeking to step up its operations after its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK’s decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work conflicts experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
The North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” Anderson said.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to about $7 billion spent on them over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster to date.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how orbital times relate to planetary formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the weight and age of the star and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the University of Caltech in Pasadena.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are about to reach adulthood.
They are running faster now than ever.
With the rotational speed at its peak, large amounts of star wind are emitted from the adult stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (which correspond to the sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — bigger spins slower than smaller ones.
“We see from Plejadien dance that the slow spinners are typically larger, while the fastest spinners are typically very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars in relation to rotational speeds.
“The Pleiadian cluster provides a pillar of support for theoretical models of the rotation of both younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and stop dancing.
Rebull and his colleagues present their most recent analysis of Pleiades' rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
