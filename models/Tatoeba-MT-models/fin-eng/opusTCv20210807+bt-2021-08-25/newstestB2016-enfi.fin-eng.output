A nine-year-old boy was found in Texas.
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's runaway trip to Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy from West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Centre, the boy has been contacted and has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening Messages around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-story.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in action, tore the paint off Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League over the weekend and also continued to manufacture in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the goal kingship of the Champions League turned at least for a moment to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time goal scorer statistics alone when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetski in the network with two hits from penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, which was tied up with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A from the early season, but in the Champions League's D-block, it began intensely with a 2-1 away victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was dulled by the absence of knee-distressed Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend's major league game, only came to the field for the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wing defender Luke Shaw's guest match lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the ManU kit that attacked the target so badly that Shaw was likely to have broken the tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests in the 41st minute to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of scoring in the Champions League began with the A-block Paris Saint-Germain.
This was the case of Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who switched Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past the rear corner by Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been ranked among the season's winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
The PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional career for the first time with his departure club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow's TsSKA lost in a B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party calls for immediate resignation - president makes wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred solely in Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech discussed the impact of China on the country’s economy.
Germany and Austria want extra summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to more effectively register in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the table of interior ministers.
In an emergency call, the professor admits he shot his girlfriend.
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call, slightly shaking the police in his home, and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. The professor said that the contact details of the family of the deceased woman would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on a white document: \"I'm very sorry and I wish I could reverse what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me - Lamb's signed letter read according to the authorities.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 km to the school campus. On campus, police found Ethan Schmidt, professor of dead history at the door of his office, who is believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, stated that the university's officials were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
There was one more death on the day, and Lamb took his own life when he was reached by the police.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff stayed behind the visually locked doors, and authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers studied the details in both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb told about the man. The researchers created a picture of a talented but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to Gautier police at the place where Prentiss died, the professor had no previous record of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb in a book that had given recognition — to the wonderful people — to whom he was allowed to live an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teaching staff. Many of the students attended courses for both men.
However, references to the problems arose.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, as if he had something wrong.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave due to some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary policy meant that the dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
University Rector William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lamb was clearly plagued by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, police determined which route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back yard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile and a half from his parents' home, according to Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still on the driveway.
The police did not immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this particular house, but Johnson said he believed that the man knew the people in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began work as a teacher in geography and education at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He received a doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb's longesttime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who for years tried to teach Hairston guitar playing.
Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were on him — said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but no document said they were married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river delta in Gautier's small town.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said he broke up with Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends and have a daughter who is now 19.
“She was shocked,” O’Steen said of her daughter.
My daughter and mother were best friends.
O'Steen had not met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5 after Lamb had played guitar and harmonica for a sparse audience.
There was nothing to say that something was wrong.
“A happy couple,” Shaffer said.
We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor.
Professor Schmidt, who received his turn, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history, according to English professor Don Allan Mitchell.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own fraternity and student union.
On the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered for a memorial in candlelight with teaching staff, other staff, students and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the night's event, where the college choir performed the songs \"Bright Morning Star\" and \"Amazing Grace\"
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to get the students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a healing day...
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as police are now telling us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further clarified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in an emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the retailer of toys and baby products says that they offer their existing employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company plans to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, and new employees will start between October and December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the trading season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary workforce for stores, as well as for the shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox makes jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of \"Back to the Future\" was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had personal significance.
“We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana is coming next to me — Fox told me the upcoming Back in Time documentary was on the trailer.
“When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales.
The Back in Time documentary is related to Back to the Future films, and the documentary interviews, in addition to Fox, with Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
“This movie is definitely an all-time time travel movie for me,” Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas as of October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military efforts, stating that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that the weapons will only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his plans to meet the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month in connection with the UN General Assembly Ministerial Week.
Ban regretted that the division of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers have caused a situation that is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on the five permanent member states to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that achieved the Iranian nuclear deal.
8 Chapters of Support Polls: Is Donald Trump Seriously?
Trump has been labeled as an empty talker.
He was also considered a joke.
Some predict the collapse of Trump.
Republican circles have (for now) unsuccessfully made every effort to pull Trump out of the poll lead.
Ten of the eleven national polls show Donald Trump double-digit support figures, and some are already seriously considering what it says in practice about the possibility of running a real estate mogul.
However, the elections are still in the early stages.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be elected a Republican candidate.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was at the poll top at this time in 2011, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain. Neither ultimately won a candidate election in any state.
Trump would be difficult in general elections for many reasons.
Outside factions such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and are beginning to dig into the spawning to bring him down.
The following recent polls show that real estate moguls cannot be ignored with a straw bath:
There has been a turnaround in Trump’s support.
Just before Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, the Monmouth University poll found that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive outlook.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans now have a positive impression of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also keep in the states where elections are held first.
In the Quinnipiac poll last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be satisfied with Trump's nomination.
In a poll by CNN and ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible selection for a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent would be very satisfied with Carson's nomination and 40 percent with Trump's nomination).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, with a corresponding support rate of 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected party candidate.
Most Republicans don’t find Trump’s temperament problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul to be appropriate for the president. Views are evident from the poll of ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: According to Quinnipiac Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be appropriate for the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
However, according to the ABC and Post poll, 44% believe Trump is unable to function effectively in the task, and six out of ten consider Trump’s temperament inappropriate for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They are starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as the party's candidate, according to a poll by CNN and ORC, four out of ten believe in Trump's potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's behalf.
Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to think Trump’s campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans support another candidate, Trump will defeat almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that a split camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump's opponents are divided into supporters of different candidates.
Monmouth University's poll at the beginning of September revealed that in a fictitious duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would get a larger crowd on his side almost always.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the win over Trump with a 19-point split in a fictional duel.
A small majority of Trump supporters have already made a vote.
According to a poll released Tuesday by CBS and NOW, more than half of Trump’s supporters are confident of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump’s view of immigration.
After Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico two months ago as rapists, immigration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will drive out important Hispanic voters from the Republican masses and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to polls published on Monday by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on immigration issues along the same lines as Trump.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with government is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently collect about half of the Republican vote in total. The popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both have come to the nomination as outsiders.
According to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, this was the opinion of six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to a poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% are on the verge of rage.
Jeremy Corby's debut in Prime Minister's Question Time
After the election, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
Labour's new frontman Jeremy Corbyn is due to rise for the first time in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn asks the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with the media and the Labour Party following the man with a hard eye.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also said that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
In the meeting, Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection with the meeting. Corbyn will now be put to the parliamentary test after the formation of a shadow government and a speech by Corbyn's Confederation of Trade Unions at the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
The Labour party's decision to remain silent during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the British Air War has received criticism from several Tory party representatives. The silence has also reached the headlines of the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman stated during Corbyn's standing national anthem, respecting in silence the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight program that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite his anti-monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to party leadership.
Robin Brant, a correspondent for BBC policy, believes that political differences over the UK's membership of the EU and the government's tightening conditions for granting benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour would propose changes to completely remove the restrictions.
Hours later, Smith, the shadow government's Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party's position is very clear: it opposes only government plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces over the past decade in the leadership of the Tory Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a new approach to politics, said he had chosen to ask Cameron questions about the 30,000 proposals he received from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, there are too many clashes in Question Time, and he promises to avoid witty lyrics and slanting and says he instead focuses on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has stated that Shadow Minister Angela Eagle will cover for her during Question Hours, for example when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Corbyn has also thrown in the air the idea that others might also be able to get out at times, and he says that he has discussed the matter with the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
Following Corbyn's rise to party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-like policy, which is often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted to failing in his efforts.
Ever since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been regarded as a key indicator of the leader’s judgment, House of Commons control and position, but critics say that Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
“Shot in Joburg”: from homeless young people to photographers
Johannesburg City Centre is a challenging environment for the homeless.
For a group of former street children, there has been a meaningful way to learn and make money.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit film studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has graduated through the project among the first.

Punta strengthens as UK wages rise
Punta strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index up.
Between May and July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9% compared to the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not included.
Faster than predicted growth was the fastest since 2009.
Punta strengthened by 1% and was quoted at $1,5505. Punta also strengthened in relation to the euro, and quoted at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49% and ended up at 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate hurt 20% when the company received a preliminary bid from the competing company AB InBev.
If completed, the transaction would bring together the two largest brewery companies in the world and bring brands under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 percent in the wake of the positive results of the rival Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast. Sales development was also driven by the boom in Burberry’s key markets in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 percent after the miners announced their intention to raise $2.5 billion with the share issue as part of their debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's shares in the packaging and paper group were the biggest drop in its 4.3 percent drop when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sale purposes.
JD Sports's rate rose by 3.1 percent after a sports company announced that its profit before taxes would rise by 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage spending could hinder expansion
Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports’ management team, said that raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the rise in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches grass roots campaign against Aldi's surge
Metcash seeks to secure its IGA store from the invasion of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and Western Australia against Aldi's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centers and the first of up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand with marketing in mainstream media and social media, as well as organizing events like Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tastings at IGA stores, and retailers sell regular customers tickets to South Australian Football League games at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to release more detailed information on its defense strategy on September 29, when food, alcohol and hardware wholesales will hold an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, with South and Western Australia accounting for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the margin yield is higher than that of the Eastern States' IGA store network.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their cornering, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a market share of 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, while Eastern states account for only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi captures 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain eats sales from all operators, but especially from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA traders could sell 360 million and Metcash could sell a notch of $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach sales of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
Metcash’s fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volume could mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes,” Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcast loses market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will decline by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the chief portfolio manager for Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that it was highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash board contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has dropped from 18% to 14%, and Metcash’s food business result for 1200 IGA retailers has fallen by 43 percent from the level of 2012. The figures show a reduction in debt financing as pressures on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale trader takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of more than $150 million in Australia to meet Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products on a weekly basis. The chain wants to support traders in the renewal of stores to increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food range of their own brands in trade.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, the price review and store reform plans are well underway, and the company is again able to increase its profits in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention instead of criticism.
According to Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a minor victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related jupaka. Kokkinakis deserves special mention instead of criticism.
The younger party of the Special K-duo duo Kokkinakis fell into unfavorable light when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly after, in a qualifying match played in Cincinnati between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the rivals twice. —Wawrinka should have given a beating to Kyrgiosis and my friend — Harrison said.
At the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis, frustrated at the field of the bat, when strong cramps ruined his fights. Healy has loyally defended Kokkinaki.
Currently, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for single-player second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
“I strongly believe that Thanasi has been dragged into the dispute,” Healy said.
“He broke the bat when he lost the game at the U.S. Open. He is by no means the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas so well that he is not proud of his actions.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison’s provocative behavior in the US Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a great family around him, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature to 19 years old, he works hard and completes the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and is respected among players. He practices hard, is in good condition and is a very stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged based on his own mirites -
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from an important round starting on Thursday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of the Canberra breeder as a long-term confirmation of the team.
“First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches instead of the controversy related to Kyrgios,” Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of the public. He deserves the criticism he has received for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange his own peace for him. I believe it is best for both the whole team and Nick.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern border from Serbia on Tuesday and caught illegal migrants, with the aim of preventing the influx of migrants.
Chaos arose at the border when hundreds of immigrants piled up in no-man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain on the road between the country's checkpoints in their tents for an indefinite period of time
Frustration began to surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they chanted “Open the Border” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some protested against a hunger and drink strike.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it would not accept that migrants will be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more come from Macedonia and Greece.
“Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not increase the damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and other countries in the coming days, as Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The collapse on the Hungarian-Serbia border began a day later when a group of 28 states failed in their efforts to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed, however, that there is a shared responsibility for the influx of 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece, and hoped that by next month or the end of the year an agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would accept 120,000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called an extraordinary summit on Tuesday to discuss the migrant crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hope in the urgent action taken by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in two southern regions the authorities were able to introduce more effective means, i.e. to close you down and speed up legal processes related to asylum matters.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migratory flows from that direction, now that a fence is already in place on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tendering process for the completion of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and a transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that the majority of the people arriving are standard-of-life refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek refuge.
Under the new law, which came into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border in the direction of Serbia and also to determine longer prison periods for convicted traffickers.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a crisis in the country,” Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, told reporters in the city of Szeged in the southern part of the country.
“We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime.
In practice, Parliament still needs to approve military action, which is expected next week, and journalists from the Associated Press news agency at the border have been seeing heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Orban's Internal Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities have apprehended 45 border crossings without trying to immediately at the border and 15 further away.
By damaging the fence, people crossing the border are now in police custody, and they are accused of crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points on the Serbian border on Tuesday, one border crossing point being closed by a train wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a small metal container with a point of contact where people packed in.
About 20 were able to fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on a hunger and drinking strike until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead against Bernie Sanders contracted by half according to national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support percentage is still two-digit in the race for Democratic National presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has reached a distance.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the vote of Democrat supporters (decrease from 58%), while Sanders is second with a 27% vote (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure for the presidential race, and his support among Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary election, it is too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than those of other candidates.
After a poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for several Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has a solid lead among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support for men has dropped significantly, and has only a 5% bow against Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among Democrats under the age of 50 and is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's lead in support contributions to Sanders among liberals was two-digit, but now Sanders has taken a five-point neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of Democrats say they would be happy to support Clinton if she was elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15% would support her just because she is a candidate.
6 percent would not support Clinton.
It’s no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic if elected.
There is more dispersal among those who do not currently support Clinton, and only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supportive of her.
48% of Democratic voters support Clinton, while only 35% of Republican voters enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked to freely describe why they support her candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16 percent). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it's time to choose a female president (13 percent) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are shared views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The vice president still weighs his potential nomination, and 57% of Democratic voters would like him to join the race, but a third would rather leave him out of the race.
When Democratic voters are asked about the second most popular candidate as party candidate, most choose Biden.
After Clinton, Biden is the second most popular candidate and far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase her lead over Sanders. With Sanders involved, the lead will be 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percent if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters view Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual election, but the share has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden’s chances of winning the election.
Democratic voters, however, attach greater importance to the views on the issues in question than to the chances of candidates winning.
Voters do not like Democrats or potential candidates as unacceptable.
The voters consider the Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate in terms of their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, trustworthy, and leadership types.
Biden is most often described as being honest, while Clinton is most often considered to be a type of leader.
As many as 30% of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, as much as 15% of Sanders.
Democratic voters believe Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to voters' own ideology.
For all features, about a quarter do not have an opinion on Sanders.
When voters are asked for views on Hillary Clinton's use of private email and her own server as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters say that she is satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and that has not changed their perception of Clinton.
Americans disagree more widely.
Half of Americans are unhappy with Clinton's investigation, and only a third are satisfied.
People's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans believe that controversial email use has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36 percent, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While the voters of their own party consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, there is room for improvement in these qualities when it comes to asking the views of all voters: Clinton considers only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of voters don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55 percent of voters across the country do not consider Trump honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump are highly qualified for leadership.
Of the six candidates included in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters, and the margin of error of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson closes Donald Trump's lead in national poll
According to a recent poll by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates took over half of the votes in the new poll, and left the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters throughout the country, Trump still has solid support. The support share has risen from 23% of the CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month. According to a poll released on Tuesday, the support share is 27 percent.
However, Carson's support would hit a staggering increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support in all population groups, and in the group of highly educated, he narrowly beats Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far behind. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio split third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent one way or the other.
According to the latest poll released last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, while Trump's support is 32 percent.
In the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was also clearly ahead of Carson.
At the men's meeting last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five members charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains ritual, five people are charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Ps fraternity of Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun-Michael — Deng at a baptism in September 2013. Police said the fraternity did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
Officials said the victim's eyes were tied, had been put on his back with a nearly 15-pound bag filled with sand, and had repeatedly been attacked as he attempted to reach a target placed on the other side of the icy field.
Deng is reported to have first complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to police, Pi Delta Ps County members did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waiting an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Chief of Police Chris Wabner told a press conference that the members, however, had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the chairman of the committee.
“At this point, members began hiding equipment, putting the interest of the partnership ahead of Michael Deng’s health,” Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been beaten several times in the head, upper body and thighs with a blunt object.
“Too many families have been shocked by the co-op’s hazing, as at least one student a year has died as a result of the hazing since 1970,” said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, in a statement.
The municipalities and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
A grand jury in Monroe County presented five members of the county to be charged with third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the club are charged with musseling and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
“We want to take responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally approved the clam,” Wagner said in a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the operation of the corporation, and the national corporation resigned from the operations of the local department.
This is how the U.S. Central Bank (Fedin) will raise interest rates
The rise in interest rates and the boom in the stock market are falling apart, the return on securities is rising and the economy is slipping into recession.
We know that.
We don’t know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
As far as the economy in particular is concerned, we can find a hint in history of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first raise in interest rates and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, though not always. The key factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to when raising interest rates begins, but how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that any fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
“The first withdrawal of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money,” Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, told customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a fairly low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, this does not mean that there are no effects.
Here are examples based on historical trends of how the impacts can be reflected in different economic sectors:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the prognosis of raising interest rates can increase instability for a period of time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
“The trend seems to be a halting of interest income on capital after the first drawdown for 12 to 24 months, perhaps reflecting a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank’s analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of an increase in interest rates.
More specifically, over a period of 35 years, a sharp rise in interest rates is usually seen in the market, about 14 percent, fairly steady for the next 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), after 500 days, the situation is normalized, and the average interest rate return after six stock cycles is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares usually increases slightly later in the cycle and interest income starts to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works for it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist in the past and could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in terms of the central bank’s key interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 key interest rates since 1950, only twice had a nominal value of less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 looks like 3.6 percent, many did not think it would last, and in the third quarter there are 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In raising interest rates in such a delicate economic situation, there may be risks and one can ask if this situation is different, Deutsche said.
In the market, operators have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and the eyes turn to this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trading shows only a 25% probability.
In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles to this day have been in a supercycle, where before the downturn, GDP will also rise very rapidly after the start of the boom,” the report said.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now is the 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in market foresaws in interest rate raising, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
“The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
For bonds, the return appears to change direction as soon as the first upward/descending cycle starts.
At the end of the rise cycle, profits will decrease immediately — Deutsche stated.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that raising interest rates causes long-term and short-term bonds to approach each other and level the curve.
“High-income bonds often perform better in such an environment, even though we are still cautious about returns,” said Kathy Jones, an analyst for Schwab’s fixed-income securities.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future trend of the central bank.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy,” Jones said.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is direct, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased.
Broadly speaking, companies operating mainly in the US market will benefit as interest rates fall and local products begin to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as the strengthening dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and debt more expensive.
“History shows that quality stocks will be more profitable in the next three months — Goldman Sachs analysts will tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet outperformed weak balance sheet firms after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also performed better with lower quality, an average of 4 and, respectively, 3 percentage points better.
Debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rate debt lose the most — Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, though experts disagree on how quickly the effects can be seen.
Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for excessive popularization.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to distinguish the channel from its commercial competitor.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards as a copy of the Brits Awards.
Damien Collins, a member of parliament, has accused The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel. Accusations add pressure to the station to prove that they offer other commercial radio stations as well.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and that the channel is not exactly different from its commercial competitor anymore.
“I don’t want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be moving in the direction of Classic FM,” Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, held last December, also received criticism from Bingham:
“The BBC Music Awards, held for the first time last year, seem like a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of what is already on the market, rather than what is new and different, Bingham says.
The BBC director-general denied the allegations and stated that the BBC Radio 3 offers far more live music and educational content than a commercial competitor.
“From Radio 3 I learned from classical music something I can’t learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and making music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works, the Director-General said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey stated that the station needs to work harder to keep the public interested, as the British know classical music better than before.
However, Radio 3 is not the only one to be criticized for entering the territory of commercial channels, at the hearing of the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice talent search competition, which the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated to cost £22 million.
The program is hardly discussed because it is not unique or particularly distinctive.
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical manner for the BBC.
Collins also called on the company to find a hit show in its own garage when it next launched a new entertainment series.
Collins, however, refused to rule out that The Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be spent on other entertainment formats.
The growth of e-commerce is the slowest ever in August, possibly due to Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
Sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000. Last month, growth was the slowest ever.
The online store was strengthened three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that a Black Friday in November can curb the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, the conquest of e-commerce has deserted many of Britain’s shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is becoming even, and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest throughout the period when e-commerce sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000, and last year e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is becoming even, and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you compare last year’s growth to the 2000 figures, it’s clear that growth will stabilize over time,” Andy Mulcahy, IMRG’s editor-in-chief, told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online shopping accelerated three years ago when consumers adopted mobile shopping.
“As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and for many people it was possible to buy in a different environment, such as a home sofa.
As mobile shopping is now more moderate, growth can level out -
Black Friday, which originated in America, is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the theme of the last Friday in November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of online shoppers compared to the norm caused the websites of many merchants to crash.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which causes consumers to rush after offers, can curb buying desires during the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion stores.
Mecca burys the victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden's family to be held accountable
Muslims carried 29 bodies on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air as Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane that fell on the Grand Mosque of Mecca
A crowd of white-dressed people had gathered in the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The convoy of sorrow passed through the pilgrimage site, where the fallen construction crane had only a day earlier penetrated through the roof of the mosque on top of the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia is demanding that Bin Laden's construction company be held responsible for the accident, which further injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims killed in the Mecca Grand Mosque crane accident were transported on the streets.
After the crane fell among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents who were starting their annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to a press release in Arabic, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report on the matter in detail. However, according to a press release in English, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque. Thousands of Muslims head to their Grand Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a notice on crane failure, and no representatives of the group have been reached for the opinion.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with the current safety regulations and of cooperating with meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of Binladin Group’s giant construction project.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi royal family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate boy who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane accident in heavy rain and heavy winds occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which it is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (about €250,000) to be paid to the relatives of the victims and the permanently disabled.
Others injured in the accident receive half of the compensation.
According to B&Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the phenomenon
“British people are hiring home builders more often,” says Veronique Laury.
Popularity has been increased by skilled, professional workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workers will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be moving home hammering and painting jobs to actors arriving from Eastern Europe.
Today, the skills of hammering and painting seem to be scarce.
Today, the British are increasingly hiring home builders to take care of the home’s work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home refurbishment store chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are made by a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, the demographic trends are worth noting, as more and more women living alone are now renovating their homes.
“The staff of our stores are still mostly men,” Laury says.
We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of five women at the helm of the British FTSE 100, and has reorganized the company's management team to ensure that male and female leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with 50 percent of its personnel being women, including the CEO and CFO.
“This was a conscious decision, and diversity is an important topic for us,” Laury said.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.
Kingfisher’s six-month operating profit and sales figures are declining, although the company worked hard after closing stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three ace government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were quickly achieved.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to be forced right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a broad demonstration of employees.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Ask them if they want to strike when things go bad.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people online have already announced that they are not going to participate in the protest and are going to work.
In the old age of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring himself a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions, with millions of members, does not give much thought, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of movement, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the drastic solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things seem to be rolling at their own pace for years, the union finally gets to the point, that is, to defend the employee’s rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to capture the role of the Ay movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the organisation’s actions, it’s nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: Aiming to save 8.5 million, personnel reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology starts a cost-saving program with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start employee negotiations on the entire staff, with a saving target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means the reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, another 2 million will be saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual operating deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by cuts in appropriations made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make approximately 2.6 million deficit-based results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research as well as the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant,” says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will begin next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Onnibus wants to go to the Finnish Railways
Sir Brian Souter, owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, told Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the shift.
Souter says he has already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the plans of the Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. Central Bank Time of Interest Resolution
The entire world is following a meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States on Wednesday and Thursday to decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Just over half of economists who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current rate of 0 to 0.25%, according to a survey commissioned by Reuters' 80 economists.
“This is a historical situation, as the central bank has been keeping interest rates close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate the normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been in a relatively good state, and the stimulus has brought trillions of additional dollars into the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not so rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday at 20.00 a.m. Central European time.
Delta State University shooter leaves apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologizes for the first murder and hopes to cancel it, officials said on Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science at Gautier Delta State University in Mississippi, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday, he said he shot a man.
Lamb called the police to his home.
I shot my wife last night - Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is no harm to anyone but who is probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but the man didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give any motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and Lamb's handwritten message, which read: \"I'm very sorry and I wish I could reverse what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before taking his own life late Monday when he was reached by the police.
University Rector William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lamb was clearly plagued by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, however, authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the triangle drama.
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is shocked.
She said her mother and daughter were best friends.
According to Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles reported that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles stated that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
“He always wanted to help others,” Knowles said.
According to police, Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them he was not going to go to prison.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, escaped on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to a curriculum vitae on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Dim stars
The last few years have been hard on the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that has happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in the Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is annoyed to remain on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the fields for another season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno in the PSV defensive zone when a fifteen-minute game was underway.
Shaw received first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
“Shaw has two fractures on his leg and is hospitalized,” Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after for surgery.
The young man, who joined Manchester United at the age of 18, has been through a lot and is now injured after great gameplay.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man was crying.
I am not a doctor, but when the leg breaks from two points, he is sidelined for half a month and no longer plays in the block stage.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have barely gotten away with the situation when there was no red card penalty shootout followed.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
“You can decide for yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-foot, reckless tackle.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages. I can’t describe how overwhelmed I am. My recovery starts here and I come back stronger than before.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw in a PSV match
The defender of England has a special reason to recover to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
“This is a very serious injury,” said PSV’s coach.
In such situations, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm their opponent.
Moreno broke his legs while playing for Mexico as Van Gaal piloted the Netherlands only at the 2014 World Cup.
“He’s very sorry because his intention was not to hurt the opponent. It’s sad to hear that the injury is serious,” Cocu said.
I didn't see the situation myself.
I only saw a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle —
“I know how it feels, I know how difficult this situation can be,” Moreno told SBS6.
I'm so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Before long, every parent will notice that the child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
In a text published on SuperCamp’s website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “The story is funny, touching and creative, and has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always some picture or message that we haven’t noticed before.
Sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is going to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, to which new characters and details were added to complete the short initial text.
“In the city of need, where real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see the right tree — the text tells us. In the 1991 version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted had no crush on the target.
Unless this is suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins with the following: “In the city of need, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl Audrey of his dreams,
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so foreign to him. Greedy Kerskanen destroys trees and makes them Supplies despite opposition from the title character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, mustached creature who protects the forests.
Likely, this kind of public relations task of minor importance has been entrusted to the assistant, apparently to one who has not read Lorax 20 times in a tube as a child.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text probably originated from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from England's team, but it's still tough
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we have seen the last loss of the 3-0 Test series by the team selected for the English tour, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than the team three years ago, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong - they have no bad experiences from 2012, only youthful positivity.
As a balled player, Moeen Ali develops as a thread pitcher, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England's Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best choice.
A few 50-point matches would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire for more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude also when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me, and he is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long a test hitter gets the chance to make an impact is difficult.
Lyth received seven international matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton got an opportunity in both home and away matches.
Perhaps the only complaint is that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team and he's a hitter I highly appreciate.
He is a cricketer of an unknown author, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start batting with Cook, thus getting an extra thread pitcher in the game while holding four fast pitchers, and I am not against the idea.
I don’t see a barrier for a top pitcher to be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already proven to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not have achieved much in his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first substitute player before getting started in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is a vice-round pitcher on the team, and based on what I have seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistical figures — an average of 31 points as a batter and 35 as a pitcher — and this may be a search shot, but very many thread pitchers have not shown that they are ready, and electors decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawardene, as an advisor in Test matches may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men in the sport, bringing with it a lot of experience because he has played in all sorts of circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball section of the game trip and brings both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed to fit international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach in his role, and, like Mahela, he has some intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be a stimulant injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day matches, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, the coach and selector do not determine the match schedule.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in a bad mood 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiating strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is, day by day, in an ever deeper swamp, even without the choice of a pleasing Jeremy — yes or no — Corbyn to the Labour Party leadership or TUC to mock Europe fiercely on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wreaked in, although not everyone is an act of their own, and some Member States are tired of the self-righteous agenda of the UK, which includes concessions of disagreement and harmful Treaty changes, which they really do not even want.
In Brighton, the TUC’s annual Congress ruled that they too would not like to be in the EU if it broke social security.
We could call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral talks in the capitals of different countries, grab a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and say they have acquired allies for reform.
Everything has to do with me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin, proposing that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point of no longer caring whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's thoughtful, sensible Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces re-election or successor selection in 2017.
His power is also waning.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain can have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them rushing to help selfie Britons who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, which they do not want either, because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments into the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK's 2017 popular election campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The latest negotiations had been arranged, and there was nothing left for Britain to do with the re-negotiations.
Europeans know how the British press preys and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, which resulted in 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone remembers far away Boris Johnson, a puny Euro-opportunist who became known as our correspondent for direct bananas in the EU in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax evaders, phone hackers, and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought roughly the same thing about them, but then realized that when you’re in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas to fool you so that the gorilla doesn’t eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more blairite than Blair when he opposed the referendum, and Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was conveniently caught off guard.
The press never forgave him either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me in the back on Westminster on Monday. I told him he had no more time to waste on me. There may be a risk that he would adopt Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the 80s. It was a mistake and it is still a mistake.
Time may pass, but Corbyn must develop a consistent strategy for socializing with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call 'constructive'.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory can probably say yes to this.
That's what Hilary-Benn, but not Bennitti, Benn told on radio and television this week when his inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move from Corbyn to appoint rugged John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father had trouble being on television to his disloyal Labour party colleagues without going too far and losing his seat in the House of Commons.
Hilary's troubles were more interesting.
Benn said he opposed staying in the EU — under all circumstances — McDonnel did not say that, nor did Corby's colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
Wanted Corby to convey no matter how sweet the image is, it must be remembered that he even touched me. Communication discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the crackdown of social media, where paranoia and betrayal smite.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass for the EU to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivalence of EU membership is suited to the Bennite blockade economy and anti-capitalism past. Discussions no longer belong to the narrow circle of leftist dissidents, to whom the idea that similarity unites is a central doctrine in doctrinal strife.
There has also been an outbreak of NATO. Tom Watson is unflinching in the fact that Corbyn is not campaigning for the departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have doubtful voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during cuts in the Tory government, which I received a reminder of on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize British Authority Statements on E-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the government-funded institution’s claims that smoking e-cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking arose at a meeting with 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized evidence presented by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in a report on e-cigarettes from the Public Health England (PHE) Public Health Authority.
PHE described its report, published last month, as a transformative and comprehensive review of results,
However, a number of researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and raised the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the Lancet Medical Journal editorial took on the teeth —a remarkably thin foundation — on which PHE’s main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers have asked the BMJ whether the claims were based - on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic assumption of public health is that policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness —
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that the PHE’s claim that, according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes should be based on detailed analysis and modeling of research results.
The claim stems from one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model wanted to harmonise participants’ views on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled in the study.
According to McKee and Capewell, the meeting's supporters included EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previous independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT) sources.
In addition, the CEO in the Sustainability Report showed support for BAT's public health activities.
One of the 12 participants of the meeting granted funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted.
However, there are many well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom admit their involvement as an industrial financier.
However, some of the participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE’s tobacco officer.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no indisputable evidence of the harmfulness of products to a wide range of products and to meet their criteria.
However, the links or deficiencies are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smokers.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every second person who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not indicate, especially in situations where relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths in the United Kingdom each year, and smoking costs £2 billion a year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, Channel 4 boss says
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial rivals would give their right hand on hit shows such as the soap opera Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used to make programs that other television stations do not do.
He criticizes the BBC for presenting programmes likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the competitors' major ratings programs, as well as on BBC4, for example.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to collaborate with the BBC, unsuccessfully.
“I don’t agree with the idea that the BBC is buying formats and broadcasting programs that would be clearly part of a competing channel’s software,” Johnson told the House of Lords’ Communications Committee, which explained the BBC’s future.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which in my opinion is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC broadcasts The Voice at its best viewing point because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel is concerned with the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
“I don’t understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies,” Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is its own production.
Many canals would give their right hand to it.
I don't understand how this serves the broadcasting company's services.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC.
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2007, and he thinks that the BBC is looking for good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC would sell off series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for the BBC's niche audience are shown on BBC4, where ratings can't be measured in most cases, but the programs fulfill their purpose. --BBC can say, while defending its hypocritical missions, that £4 billion in broadcasting fees did make special programs that no one watched --
The BBC presents them as times when no one ever sees them.
Johnson said: “I challenge you to find another system that is as old-fashioned in that sense, who gets the best benefit.
Everyone, of course, thinks that £150 a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if you don’t see the BBC very much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 channel leader David Elstein, who also gave his own views in committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new information, teaching and entertainment.
According to Elstein, the current BBC offering hardly has any tutorials — 1% on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and turn its mission into a new faith: —information, illumination and entertainment —
On the collaboration issue, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts from events such as the Proms festival, which was broadcast only a fraction of the concerts last year. —BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offering available online as well — he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenics
The video shows how the nematode changes direction when it is subjected to ultrasound.
Scientists have been breeding worms whose nervous system has been genetically altered so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle worms change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound, the frequency of which is above the auditory range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified to have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
Scientists monitor brain activity through light
According to the researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the power of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). The method utilizes ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with a stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that the method could one day be used to replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
However, Chalasani noticed that worms begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopically small bubbles.
According to Chalasan, bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves that advance into worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are found in some of the worm cell membranes.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the nematodes with ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves controlling their movement appeared TRP4-ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed to modified worms, micro bubbles strengthened sound waves and moved to the worms, causing a signal to set in motion in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate neurons through light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is the brain that is being studied is controlled by optical fibres. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, easily penetrate the cell, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
“We believe that gene therapy and viral therapy can be used to temporarily expose human neurons to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments,” Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices —at your door!
Ads are a disgrace to British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms exhibition video.
Horrible killer missiles!
Footcuffs breaking ankles!
Grape bombs!
Remote laminates that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
A cheerful voice and cartoons clearly reveal that the advertisement for the world’s largest arms show is parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government’s efforts to sell arms to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair held at the ExCel Exhibition Center in Docklands, London.
DSEI Arms Fair: Authoritarian administrations arrive in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subway cars that require a second glance.
The announcement is similar in appearance to those of the London Metro. At the end of the metro line there is a picture of a tanker on the other side.
In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands. Customers will be asked for help in order to close the arms trade fair.
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters around London with a £6 advertising space hacking package with six-door keys, allegedly accessing about a third of the world’s bus stop advertising poster stands.
Transport for London is not funny.
One of the spoilers of the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political works to the public for viewing outside galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought to the real world. Many people move on to work with activists from protest movements.
One of the posters against the arms trade greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times a day via Facebook. It was designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the narrator have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, Artistic Director of the VCCP, said: “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They tried to do away with a more realistic, shady corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract more attention.
“They’ve done a wonderful job and helped us bring up fairs where illegal torture equipment is being traded,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
“Now the government must take action to ensure that torture instruments are not illegally sold right at our doorstep.”
However, perhaps the most creative product of the Arms Fair is on display in the exhibition premises themselves at ExCeL, where exhibitors make use of the huge euphemisms of their merchandise.
In a press release, Saab announced an order made by the U.S. Army regarding the — portable AT4CS RS —
The product includes a specially crafted warhead that effectively penetrates directly to the target.
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in dorms
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in berets and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I provoked, and countless, long complaints from others.
The most important lessons can be summarized in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory is the least stressful experience and at worst shocking.
It’s easy to talk about the situation: tell everyone what you’re from, whether you like the middle of the year and why, what you like about Corbyn, and why you don’t really hate or love Marmite, because it’s just yeast extract, hahaha, I’m in my room.
Sometimes take a breath.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask questions about others.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn’t even talk to when your rips would be in flames and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give others space.
My own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but my own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
Don’t even think you can combine socialization and university studies.
For introverts, college is a tough place.
A private room should be a place to relax. However, in many dorms, a social culture is formed, in which you walk from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to recover.
It’s not possible to say in this environment, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so I can recharge the energy I used to date you.”
Try to find out if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and instead send a text.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my student dorm who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone’s door, you don’t seem like a 50’s, a little weird case: “Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something small for you. Smile when I’m curious about your personalities”
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your schoolmates are forced to talk to you. Thanks to a tasteful surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable baking skills from you.
If you serve unhappy lumps made of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Cooking is also a common violation in student dorms.
Taking another chicken is stealing, of course, but can you pour a drop of your tea from someone else’s milk can?
Always check with the owner of the milk carton.
You’ll probably get permission, even if the milk quotes the owner of the jar.
I understand very well that it is annoying for someone to wag something from you. However, try to handle the situation as adultly as possible, unlike my own student friend, who used a detergent in his milk as a punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Do not make noise when others are trying to sleep or study.
Not only because it's polite, but also because it's worth remembering that everyone else digs a hole...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the neighboring room to adjust the sound of the music lower, for it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the neighbor's room was finally quiet, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours for the exam, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse moved to the same dorm?
And wouldn’t it be strange if you first thought that your student mate would be your future spouse, you would start dating, you would break up, and you would have to see him every day, and you would lose the visiting rights of your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the student is definitely not the only one, try to control your desire.
If you notice in a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the limit of prank and bullying is more subtle than one might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you can recover from in a moment.
Hiding something can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one’s room should be messed up with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of the second room can be locked and dropped into a water glass, which you put in the freezer, but do not attach anyone's things to the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple of times more.
Racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kitee - House planned as reception centre was bloated in Salo
A racist attack on Kitee in North Karelia took place at the residence of foreign students on Saturday morning.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at Kitee Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the Folk High School's accommodation facilities were truncated with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodations, police in Eastern Finland said.
According to Luke, who is responsible for the youth guarantee education at the Folk High School, there were approximately ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adult people were free to move, and some of them could be elsewhere,” Luke says.
The public college has accommodated people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time and young asylum seekers who have just arrived.
Everyone in the cluttered building has a \"A\" status.
Some of them study in adult primary school, some of them in vocational studies and some of them study in Finnish, says Luke.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of harm and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, a briefing was held on Monday for the students, which also included the necessary interpreters.
There is no panic and no one wants to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened.
According to the reader, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
It was suspected that at least three men were involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, as this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious, Luke says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was announced on MTV’s website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had a swastika drawn and written in English - You are not welcome -
A crime report has been filed with the police.
Attention 15 September at 4:02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa, the passengers in their brittle, - just idiotic -
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Rasepori ceases to travel in March.
The news angered passengers entering the early evening shift of the train at Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the downfall strikes the Siuntio people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s idiotic because the population is growing all the time and those working need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can only depend on political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that HSTV’s interview video will bring a tractor to the capital.
There are also train changes in the rest of the country.
The H and R trains on the main line are connected to the new R line.
Purola’s position in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström believes that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y-train is also used by non-Rabese and Siuntio people, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Espoo-based Annina Pöyry was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further from the city area by train.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to plan their trip again,” he said as he pained on the Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection is expected to be introduced to the shoreline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the cost.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million per year for the Y-train, the ministry of course much more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of trains doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Valkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys are made per year, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring an annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in The Currentity of Capital:
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, former chairman of the SVP, in a book published today, the topicality of Marx's Capital.
He is now taken more seriously than for a long time - Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy increasingly into all walks of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, respected economics expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical — now and forever —
However, the former President of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Federation of Finnish Industries is not a Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a topical economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
“The usual view is that the history of ideas tells about the wrong opinions of dead men — Korkman begins.
Marx’s predictions went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that took too far from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“The most important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he said.
Again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological upheaval,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Marx, however, is well worth studying.
“In the 70s, Marx could not be read,” Korkman said.
\"Maoist and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but more of each other.
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weights of the past years.
“Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx’s mindset, as with other classics,” Korkman said.
UN calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, the news agency AFP said.
The United Nations report on the 1983-2009 civil war came out on Wednesday after a lengthy postponement.
The report blames both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people were killed in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The number of victims is not exactly known.
In particular, a major offensive by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blamed torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides reportedly committed the murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to organize an investigation itself, but will not allow the creation of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English Yo experiment allowed us to think about social media
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language, which most of the students had in English.
More than 16,000 students tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language 150-250-word article could be addressed to the administrator of an online magazine advisory column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people.
There were four subjects in total, one of which had to be chosen.
It was the most difficult of them - to assess the third topic of Porvoo Swedish-language high school English lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third topic was just a quote from former President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one was great, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have practiced writing speeches — Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment — pretty normal —
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts such as the adaptation of flounder to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn writings will continue on Friday, when there will be another Finnish or Swedish test.
In upper secondary schools, the test is held normally, which means that the demonstration of employees does not affect it.
The Student Qualifications Board invites the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the exam.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop in Oulu was robbed at gunpoint
On Wednesday morning, a shop in the Clock District was robbed in Oulu.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a face-covering commando.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
Protests against government cuts will block central Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
In turn, the task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out alert tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant protest is carried out.
Roads leading to the railway square are closed to motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west direction from Mannerheimintie onwards.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that it is enough.
I don't take a stand on the police's work-fighting issues.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police don't tell us the exact number of patrols.
“Something is coming, but we usually manage on our own,” Kujala says.
Police said they should avoid private cars in the city centre on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the centre of the city.
Stable traffic is expected from early morning.
With the arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to the railway station.
Buses are generally far away.
The rest of the trip must then be walked to the protest site, Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side.
The question of the fluency of public transport, which is normally at hand in these big crowds of gatherings, is now partly self-managed.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people, says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday’s protest is in many ways exceptional — remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison point in Finnish political history,” says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Sisiiäinen at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the Ay Movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is really trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the protests on Friday.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration brings about among those who the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered in different parts of Finland protested at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s protest, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (center) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and wage-earning organisations had never been as bad as during Aho’s bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the days of October.
Besides, Finland’s most bourgeois government is now in power, says Sisiainen.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite what the Finns Party has said.
At the time, there were certain elements of the old working-class movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and potentially closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're on the sidelines.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish Ay Movement have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisiainen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted for three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s Metal and Electric Strikes
The most notable strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a motion from the Conciliation Committee after the strike lasted for seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
The 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
October of 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many of whom were unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate their support for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were exposed to egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
“Siperia is teaching, the EU is ending,” was one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers threw tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and mass redundancies by nurses in 2007.
The threat of disengagement eventually spurred the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors strike in 2001
Doctors on strike - forced to - were the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation investigates the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck at Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone on the truck was in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the site of the incident in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign background, who is about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
The story of five smugglers, a refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier, and a wealthy businessman
A rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a class-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people carry out smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their customers and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
The HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
For its location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
This is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about EUR 8,000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia for him.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until the refugee crisis erupted again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided so that customers can barely survive.
Accommodation costs around 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with an extinguished lantern.
On the first night we drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes sea travel is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir embarks on a return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he's beating his clients, and at least he says he's beating the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once he was struck by the police, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I grabbed customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard,” Emir said in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is a taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last few, and it has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the city centre, men travelling without their families are staying in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some people also stay in private residences, but it’s a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovaða region, at a major human smuggling hub, people are dying tired.
The Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their things once and that’s enough,” Goran said.
He said Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly fool all the way.
First, the price is 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people, he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only €50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 300 kilometers, most of the comfortable motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points out the right direction for his customers and shakes off.
In the work of kindness
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, with a large number of Congolese believers, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are being moved from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client first calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money quietly and float among merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from areas such as the North Kivu War Area, and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old ID will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
It is aided by Missionary contacts with Ugandan police.
The client will then be redirected to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills each step separately: filing an application to Ugandan police costs around 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and moving to a European country, for example, 4 500 to 7 000 euros.
Folios and ice cubes
Tom's a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on the way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving a freeway A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go directly to prison for organizing illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom picks the right truck - we have to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example - and cuts off the safety wire on the cover.
It has to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, a similar thing that is wrapped around a fryer or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene hoping that the driver will not rush into the stowaways, at least not before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Uppork, the Turk has been called the master of marketing and the indisputable king of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who dominates maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and continuously developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are rented yachts supposedly to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships will be loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who will be transported from Istanbul to a port and then to Europe by sea, for a fee of EUR 5 000 to 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the cover.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53,000 from one luxury ship trip after the cost.
He does not do the practical things himself, but hires captains, recruits, guards, hosts, and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organized and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrected 16 September 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
The American Olympic Runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book, which has competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the Games in top condition and ran in qualifying for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership position with a manic run.
150 meters before the target, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and was passed by other rivals one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's fare was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he was looking for the same adrenaline spikes as he had when he competed in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he suffered from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came to light at the end of 2012, when an article about him was published by Smoking Gun magazine.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was the world's number one at 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but remained the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster under control:
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of fitness, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the athlete agreement all summer and autumn, like last year.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not qualified for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of its contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming World Cup.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union put the ski rooster under control.
“Thank you for pointing the backbone,” Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union,” he said.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season for the national team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also takes care of future generations and does not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that Northug has been granted financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I was part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday in which he assured that he wanted to play in Norwegian colors next season at the World Cup as well as after that at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, two of which were gold.
He was on the team that won relay gold last winter in Falun.
Paistin translators’ shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On the day of the shields 25.9. there will be stunts in various restaurants and stores, which have been granted a plate of roasters.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but that top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of shield restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: From the establishment of Kauhava reception centre to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the facilities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy in Kauhava’s former garrison.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent critical infrastructure in the region, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Sepillisverkkot Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been clarified during the preparation of the reception centre.
For the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, for example, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists at the evening after meeting the presidents of all parliamentary parties with their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation connected all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the underlying issues.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges.
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
He is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
The issue of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.

Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers in a protest all Friday
Metro and tram drivers take part in a demonstration on Friday from the start of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff told STT this evening.
Most of the Beginners close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s protest also causes disruption to Posti’s services.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross’ blood transports are carried out in spite of the strike.
The aim is also to carry out meal transports as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
You can find information about the services on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Beginners close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Service Trade Union (Pam) has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called on grocery trade workers to participate in the protest of trade unions.
SOK and Kesko representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep stores open with supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki Kindergartens partially closed
The Helsinki day care centres will not operate in full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education reports.
Due to the protest of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and the club activities of kindergartens and playgrounds will not be organised.
24-hour day-care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities and autism are organised normally.
The Finnish Early Childhood Education Agency promises to inform about the changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels of communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time,” Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often a recurring way the Prime Minister’s television and radio talks will become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on YLE channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, then let's see.
We are now using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that the public have television and radio talk.
The subject matter we are talking about here is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That’s why we ended up in this channel,” Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21.05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
Siipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not tell about the more general inward turn of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of a recent comment by Secretary of State (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant with Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media didn't respond.
The style of communication of political decision-makers is not a notification issue in a democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians into account.
According to Koivusen, televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there anything more we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the promise, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this sense, it is a risk, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be stigmatized as a medium of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in accordance with Yle’s interests or the general line.
A clever move from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s upcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say,” the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and what is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, because this allows him to express his own view without any gravel sounds.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions can be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - the sweat of sweat, the shaking of hands.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to put it well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform one thing, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly do.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be very exceptional.
He said it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires extraordinary means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
Workers' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä’s dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide from the endless,\" Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Texas.
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy has been found and at home, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Finnish National Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fascination of young people: You will cause hatred
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish free fighter, posted a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a weighty speech against youth street fights.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking to see an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the youth's fad.
Amirchan, 26, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking down, sitting on top of the other and striking without thinking about any of these consequences, as you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people in the video are from an immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police, social media has uploaded fighting videos for both immigrants and Finnish youth.
It's just that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come to a great deal.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a long time.
“That’s a different way of thanking you for being here,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are ever subjected to racism, you can blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go with someone like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action puts stakes on racism.
You make me hate something I don’t like.
You’re doing pretty bad things, and you’re not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK chairman Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation is considering its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wage-earning organization SAK to soften its previous position.
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a few comments on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions — to open the labour market lock — and that agreements between active parties are needed instead of forced laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: A big demonstration is threatening to fall -- it seems a little funny to put a fist on --
It feels a little funny to put a fist on if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket,” writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospherics vary from one side to the other in the wage camp.
Is the government going to call it off, or is it going to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK federal leaders burst holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened.
The threat spread to the Akavas.
Teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK, performed in a conciliatory manner.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and prepared an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap that Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hastened immediately to announce that his compromise papers are already ready.
At first, there was no room in the office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree when federal leaders just Monday told him to put the country up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions - to open the labour market lock -
In order to create a common proposal for wage and salary earners, the SAK should be able to accept the five per cent productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola’s STTK has good relations with the Sipilä government.
Palola’s right hand, Jukka Ihanus, STTK’s Director of Social Impact, previously served as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi from the city centre.
Palola said that the government’s expertise in ay has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s exit took a bit of a boost from Finland’s halters, whose front image is Marko Piirainen (sd) of the ACP.
It feels a little funny to put on a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again\"
Russian Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin criticizes the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, a fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, at which Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced to join the European Union, to come to the meeting - something that the President could remind journalists of.
We believe that it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to enter the country without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to prick Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its excellent organisation.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation in Ulan Bator.
The lock meets a real playoff troll: - Paints tight -
Killara and Clave continue the bull days in Hakametsä today when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual paint festivals in Hakametsä today.
Yesterday, Tappara went to Kuopio to drill for a 3-2 continuum stopover from KalPasta.
The rise was manly, as the silver group of last season was at its worst from a two-goal loss position.
Tuesday's lock was more minor.
The guest of the Blues, who had recently begun the catch of the Raumans, was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti anticipates arrangements on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
In the previous two seasons, the killer has just dropped in the semifinals of the Locke final series.
Both times, the solution has required a decisive seventh match.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three flanks and past.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in group configurations.
The cashiers that both rejected yesterday get a flute shift today.
Mika Norone makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lock poles.
Point of view: A sad play going on
Toivola, Director of Sports, wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sent a sensational struggle to the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The unnamed and wooden pot case progressed to everyone's astonishment for the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Matt of Pori and Pele of the Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the iroquois.
She became a blonde.
The great TV presenter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that the new version of this season will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager for Ässie has built a potaka on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than puck-like gaming.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no other Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
The Iron Rock philosophy of the game does not include rushing and gimmicking.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
Last season Garret Stafford of Ässien tackled Tapparan Jere Karelian on the head.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to the ace hockey, the hot Iron Rock burst after the game to the nation of Satakunta.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops, and uplifters.
There are practically no key men in the best playing age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skills gap.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season’s events have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited,” Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
Aces balance in the season's three league games has equal number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Hopelan should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, in the movie I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays under Tuuka’s guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna's film \"You Are Beautiful\" is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
The cricket tsems and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my real role model, Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka even before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulona would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression and it was really dreary.
There was a rather small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuuka’s youth even before film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tukka, known as Heinola's infamous skateboard story.
Olga was an everyday life and a good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At least he could have secretly fallen for it.
According to Olga, he has collaborated so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that the big joint project is not scary.
Everything has always been super well.
Now the entire production team is going to film for a month in Heinola.
However, a couple living in Iit is often planning to drive home for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over all of Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland’s most expensive drama film
Timo Vuorensola’s film Iron Sky: The Coming Race has a budget of €17 million.
Filming will begin in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes Finland’s most expensive play of all time with a budget of €17 million.
In the past, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been in Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation is also set to pass Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
Films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I have been sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told the magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million would be intruded into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there is no slack at all.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters’ fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or t-shirt sign was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, the line between funny and trendy is vague: if something is already really junta, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by preferring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of the grey base college, we are now putting on the sweatpants buried at the bottom of the cabinet, where the manufacturer’s logo appears.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas’ recognizable stripe netters, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s autumn sweaters makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Are you ready to show off the logos in your dress?
Russian politician released proof: I didn’t get stuck in the tank door for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present products from the Russian military industry.
In recent days, the Russian media has reported that the Russian Ministry of State of Emergency had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of an armored vehicle in quite good moods and, at least not based on their images, it’s not about getting stuck or angry.
That's total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served at the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace,” Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
To the Russian military TV channel, Zotov explained that he admired the new technology of Russia in the exhibition, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what’s inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks,” Zotov said.
Zotov also called it the stupidity of a journalist who wrote about it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
“I’m tall and raving, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn’t happen,” he told Russskaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged immaculateness have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people attended the arms show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck originated from a case on Bloknot.ru, where Zotov was told he was battling out of the tank hatch while trying and eventually threatening to shoot everyone around him unless he got out of his pin.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers gave their own views on what was happening.
Everyone is used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armoured vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours,” said Alexander Pisarevsky, the exhibition coordinator at Bloknot.
Here is my favorite blogger.
The architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candlestick from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that’s what it was originally.
The architect brothers are known to have long and mathematically refined the shape of the candlestick.
It was initially presented only to the esteemed guests of the gentlemen's dinner.
Kubus candles are manufactured by family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of renowned brothers.
Candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.

10 points about the effects of Friday Stop on you - watch the video!
A trade union demonstration will take place at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11-13, but the strike will affect the lives of citizens for a much longer period of time - all day long and even beyond.
The ISTV studied with 10 points how the Friday stop affects citizens.
Watch the video to see the impact of stoppages on road and rail transport - on the transport of goods and passengers alike.
Air transport is its own number.
The strike action is severely disrupting it at least around noon, but the reflections are likely to continue until Saturday.
What about schools and kindergartens?
The police and the fire department?
Food stores, starters and mail, not to mention factories and ports?
The details of the strike information may be changed before Friday.
The website of the Evening Messages will keep you informed.

A leak has occurred in the Kittilä mine at Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called rich-shiekka pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool has a foaming process of neutralizing the enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped either for reuse as process water or, in accordance with the permit, conducted through a surface-draining field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material was released into the environment.
The leak was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish Country Report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire agreement system and for unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF’s assessment has a lot to say about the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
This includes, for example, infrastructure investments,” Kuoppamäki says to Talousanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to see 0.4% growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth to remain zero this year in his new business cycle forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention has been paid to industrial confidence or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only about a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The 65-year-old Kimishima’s choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata’s footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to bring Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear each year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of minors disappear each year.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Adviser at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone were made in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelema says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were closed because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By September 6, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone.
There are no overall statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well, he emphasises.
What about those who have been sentenced to conversion?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, says Kannelma.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered applicants.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Home Affairs Ministerial Conference, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, told on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of devices
The equipment used by media pioneer Timo T.A. Mikkonen for television and radio productions, who has lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in the industry.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows on Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many hobbyists - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Tylmälän home.
There is no way we can take all the goods with us.
I am slowly starting to inventory and see what things are being disposed of.
That’s what I started with, Nina says.
There is no longer any use for radio and television equipment.
From the recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has made a long career does not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to get worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend power action in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to halt metro and tram traffic only for a demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop all day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big in the field.
The cuts in the night and shift supplements are severely damaging to drivers, so the government's plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area will virtually stop altogether.
According to VR, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. drive to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pit.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superior forces, says Pirkko Repo, HSL spokesperson.
Repo says HSL can’t say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Workers’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, according to the AP news agency.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thinks self-made clock is bomb
In the United States, Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old in Texas, has been arrested after the teacher considered the self-made clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the juvenile detention cell.
Mohammed has never claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found the watch to have appeared to be a movie bomb.
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the American-Islamic Council of the country wonders if the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour Party MPs.
This has hurt the people,\" Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial commemorated the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and emphasizes his respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the National Anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Especially among MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to perform for the first time today as party leader in parliament during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families,” the Prime Minister tweeted.
The cause of the Minnesota family killing remains unclear - the family's father was waiting for a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was their father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns about the absence of children at school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection visit and found Short's family dead in various parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million Houses and a Successful Company
The South Lake Minnetonka police chief, Michael Siitari, is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million visitors each week.
I have received 50 offers from the company in the last 10 years.
I have rejected all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was seen in the fact that in 2011, the Short family bought a staggering house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised as the dream of a car collector in the real estate site Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offers various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's website, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on her honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros with his win.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Coach Korpi of the successful horse gets full peace when working with the horse.
Peter decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll shut up, Lori.
It's an amazing gesture from an NHL star, the biggest donation ever made by an athlete.
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens.
Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
The players of the Canadiens have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer testing to the hospital.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening - serves food with bikinis and a fair on.
The theme cafés are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug café and now a wife café on the market.
It strikes the lonely, the companion pains, and the hungry.
It was reported by Metro.
In Tokyo’s Ore no Yome café, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waiter pretending to be the client's spouse.
Half - is selected from the list before coming to the café and he prepares and serves the food.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the grid: attacks against car security began to equip themselves
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to Intel.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB, Intel can consolidate safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been waiting for years like the moon's rising.
At last, the car is starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford announced RS data now that the car world is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100, with a peak speed of 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting in Finland, initially it is estimated to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford said in a statement.
Favourite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than the two innovations in Finland.
The Sportage, created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more circular than before.
A cent has come to the shaft gap and outside dimensions and the car is cutting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More information about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption is reported closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the change of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the new car doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with better driving capabilities, lower noise levels and higher-quality equipment.
Optimos with a 1.7-litre turbo diesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine are available.
Next summer, the pace accelerates with the addition of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu Returns to Stages in Brave Overall Costume
Singer Chisu is at the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric-blue trousers have a spectacular, open neckline.
The costume beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year hiatus, the singer who became a mother has lost weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to be a year old.
The singer released her first single on a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn’t really bother me.
I miss everything about music, the singer said.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release a new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Surprises Again
Kim Kardashian, a true TV actress, gives talks one after another.
She shows off her pregnancy stomach and breastplate freely in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one o'clock in America when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left the job of husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress as the flash lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity suit was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York only a couple of days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as recent as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnant stomach on the show shift.
The Hard Laws of the Model World: No Home, You Are Lonely, Competition Is Terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins with nothing.
Even if in the previous season you were posing in top designer costumes, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces enter the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not only one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own people.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at the Tory Burch show last night.
Fashion Weeks are currently taking place in New York City, where designers reveal their collections for next year.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown musician in the film Apulanta
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in the film based on the early years of the band Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I’m soon a 26-year-old rapper, and in this film I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Ant before the filming because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it’s good that I’m just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to impersonate people.
A man piloting a completely empty band, Scrooge Salminen and Dogs, does not take on the role.
Punk mangers come with the man naturally.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many of you probably saw a preview, as well as if you’ve ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been anything small, but we always go to the fullest.
From 1993 to 2004, Tuukka Temonen’s “Make Us Beautiful” film The Lead Actors were announced today.
The core group, which became familiar to the band's audience, is portrayed to the general public by relatively unknown young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temos by Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip on his upcoming job as early as last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a photo of his new look on Instagram, which he has had to make for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Over the past few days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell a child about the situation of refugees who are trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR Crisis Team.
Younger children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, he says.
However, if a child has come across TV news footage of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child’s fears can be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the older one thinks he is afraid of.
A child should not be intimidated in vain, even if he is distressed and afraid of himself.
A younger child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents should discuss the matter with them if they think about the child.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how our family responds to this.
After all, is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker”
Your power at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
It's hard to control the ball lightning that hits Vermoon
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone Apila's Ball Salama into a sharp blow in mid-summer.
It only ran for wins and second place until the collapse in Tampere at the end of July.
Since the stallion was thoroughly frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of time for his protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not from the mildest end, but it took two cures to overcome it.
Since Apila’s Pallosalama was forced to exercise light, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE oak in its record time in Turku after Taruntuuli.
Clover's ball flash was very pressurized from the break when it had been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
With that in mind, a slight tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition has struck the stallions.
The horse must have moved forward, and I hope it has stabilized as well.
Clover's ball has been called humor horses.
When it's not funny, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have been disengaged by the lightning rush that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, the competitors can’t handle the ball flash, which even takes off warm-blooded rides.
There is a peseta race in Vermo.
However, the other thing is how the Clover Ball Flash agrees to it.
It’s pretty hard at the time of departure and it might be a swing from under the boom of the starting car and all that.
I hope it's calmer than going down.
While in good condition, Apila’s Pallosalama can also come from the bow, and we start to drive with it for the win, the coach promises.
This is why you can’t get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future — but not all of them.
Apple plans to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, according to Tim Cook, CEO of the company.
There are a number of programs on Apple’s iPhone that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newspaper kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone,” Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue, as the company doesn’t want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation dropped to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, according to Eurostat.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in the euro area, i.e. 1.4 per cent, in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank forecasting in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, will again start raising interest rates for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it could start raising interest rates this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
Thus, the next recession can hit the top at its fastest by next autumn and as a pace of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they used to - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by Jim Reid, market research strategists at Deutsche Bank London, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and report do not think they know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of the previous interest rates - and what may result from that.
It turns out that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a worse position to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Perhaps not a year from the start of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy and its respective tuning leaders have throughout the summer and early autumn hinted that the time is starting to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years may come this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed Board’s so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate was in June 2006.
Then ended a series of relatively regular but at a time small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with the Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%, which lasted exactly two years.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of housing financing the most risky in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the serious adversities of the financial markets and the real economy started slower than has typically been the case since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turn of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
On the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial implications, they have been making clear since the 1950s.
At its fastest rate drawdown, less than a year has passed since the start of the recession, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of Fed's interest rate increases.
The Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its steering rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has deviated from some of the others, and the narrator is relatively sparse in the review, so it is hardly possible to determine for sure the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
This time, however, the strategy points out that a lot of things are different.
Not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be undisputed even by decades of research.
But three facts about the causes of the crisis and its destructive effects must be somewhat clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, and at the same time grew the next.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy, which was already too high, increased even more as a result of central banks’ monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble in the economic history of that time was created.
3) In particular, the crazily cheap debt financing, which was packed almost without restraint in the financial economy, inflated the largest exchange bubbles in the financial markets from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities in the economic history of the time.
Nor does it create a very severe controversy that financial markets, which had risen to an even more complex level of leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The debt leveraged financial structures, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last longer than after interest rates had started to rise and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give the following reasons:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy cheap as ten years ago, but now debt money is at its cheapest literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not become lighter, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is considerably heavier than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from central banks, which is higher and cheaper than before, has mostly remained in the financial markets and has been the most expensive of the main types of securities and assets, either before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only do the strategists stalemate with financial market warning signals, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession on the model that has happened in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but similarly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next begins to tighten its money supply to a tighter level.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, a Societe Generale strategist, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for a long time coached the bank’s international investor clients for Fed’s following turnarounds:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for the Fed to rush out to put out financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will focus on sales in November, and HP Inc., which will focus on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced by 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
The other year, its three most important customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.

Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, for which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule,” Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Karelia-Upfloor Board of Directors from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Board of Directors and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the holdings of Kährs in Luxembourg pass through a multi-tier ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the Finnish family company’s capital was realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context,” Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company have no tax planning involved.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose area of activity is especially the production of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the Centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative working life blackmail package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government’s working life blackmail.
The organization also wishes to include other employee central organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in the protest on Friday.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of work will be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola remarked to reporters during the meeting of the organization’s administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security provided by the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party has a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if it's one-to-a-hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the operation of the Sunday supplements is a painful place for the STTK organisation.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would implement some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that an alternative package would be prepared with the SDP that was holding the issue.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to the protest, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines with Akava, as Akava has long outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that Lauri Lyly will lead SAK to prepare the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate a 5% competitive leap sought by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to see the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
The same boat, the same coal, the same talokos - - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Tampere University Green Left's Viva bingo coupon for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels Wednesday night at 21:05.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, one must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train performers with a televised speech.
Monophony, Monarchy
His speech has sparked criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that “Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss the speech”
According to the Greens, there has already been a single call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned the monarchy: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for him.
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “Soon six months after the election.
No appearances from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is @juhaasipila afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live broadcast by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
He has been criticized for making a speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote the comprehensive publicity of the whole of Finland, according to Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications, in the news.
Like us in Tammel
The speech has also sparked mockery.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom puts on a nicer dress and my dad puts on a tie around her neck.
At 9 a.m., we’ll be quieting down to the TV as we used to in the past when we were in Tammels - writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also explains why the Finnish government has millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that it is necessary to cut back when the government has run out of money,” says Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted a bingo feature on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to disband Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,\" President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan by which al-Assad would, after some time, give way to power elegantly.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall in a matter of weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points in a bilateral debate: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and Assad had to be contacted immediately and the Assad withdrawal had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment.
Ahtisaari reports that he forwarded Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several mass killings at that time, and key opposition groups refused all agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches, as his experience has shown that Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authorization.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins also said he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to hold power with some of Assad's supporters.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the talks in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum seekers’ organisation centre in Tornio
An asylum centre designed by the government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in the city centre in an empty Tornio joint lyseo building.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose a school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-president of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the debate.
The organization center was opposed by 13 delegates.
This would make it possible to expect the decision to be positive, he said.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was quickly reacted to.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense, says Nousiainen.
The Labour Market Still Wants an Alternative to Extortion
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä, the halving of holiday money in public would only take care of part of the government’s goal of lowering the price of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, half of the holiday money would be a means of working, because it would target almost all employees, unlike the cuts planned by the government on Sundays, for example.
Labour market organisations could agree on cuts in holiday money, because they have been entered in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will report to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become more and more difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won’t take long for that kind of thing to happen if there is a will,” he said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, changing the Epiphany and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
Reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation past trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
Because of the actions, the Central Workers' Organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves extension of warehouse in Mahlahall
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved, but slightly murmuring, the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, or sap hall warehouse.
The reason for the criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than what was originally discussed.
A busy schedule too.
It was also a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the context of the interim report.
An investment of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200,000 was still on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as rent,” Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
the Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous steep position to bring street name signs in Karelian languages to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared for the use of Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing on a case-by-case basis.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a unilingual municipality, it is also worth taking a broad-minded approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be used in a wide range of marketing in the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the province's vitality
Cuts in train connections hit the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And it also affects whether you can live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raised the issue of air transport, the continuation of which has also been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that our chances of success are not reduced by government measures, as is now the case.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example,” Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siun Sotelle
Joensuu City Board’s view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also.
Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured), a member of the City Board, presented at the board meeting on Monday that the whole project would be abandoned, but his proposal became unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one pair of trains.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains leaves, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for train traffic for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed from the cliff to the roof, who couldn’t get down from the roof on his own.
The situation was born in Torniomäki on the Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to take to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slid off the scene and the passers-by alerted the rescue department to help pull the ladder to the last one left on the roof safely back to the surface of the earth.
Fluctuations in FedEx's net sales, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak performance in the last quarter. The transport industry left weakened its full-year performance forecast due to reduced demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company’s share fell by about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the actual trading opening on Wednesday.
FedEx forecast is $10.40 to $20.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast has a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a factset study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated on average despite price increases of 4.9%. The increases will come into effect on 4 January. Additional fees for the land transport of heavy or large shipments will come into effect in November.
The company is still expecting profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, increased net sales and increased e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has performed well in a weaker-than-expected economic situation, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans for hiring seasonal workers were announced one day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, from 90,000 to 95,000 people.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, a 6% increase.
The earnings per share were $2.42, so Zacks Investment Research's $12 analyst forecast remained.
Revenue rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, net sales were expected to be 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class shipments in recent years, which has caused the company’s Express unit to stagnate.
The strong growth in e-commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground’s performance.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurances.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher base charges, while the return on freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading opening, FedEx stock price had dropped to $3.85 or 2.5 percent for $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11 per cent from the annual average and 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the Fed of the U.S. Central Bank meet for the most anticipated meeting in years. The group sits at a wood table of eight-metre diameter in Honduras to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative two-story meeting room is a mural depicting the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the financial interests of the state above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank management has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
On Thursday, the Central Bank is to announce whether the U.S. economy is ready to start weaning from the unforeseeable stimulus offered by short-term interest rates that remained close to zero in the end of 2008.
While most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in financial markets can cause officials at the already cautious central bank to fright at increasing volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate — even a quarter of a percentage point.
“The labour market and inflation are of course the first and most important in their practical follow-up,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market will give enough reason to wait,” Piegza said.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree on what the central bank intends, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of economists surveyed Bloomberg this week.
However, in the financial markets, the central bank is expected to wait, and according to the main indicator, there is only a 30% chance of a withdrawal.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices may fall unless policymakers soften the shock by promising another drawdown.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index defected 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
“The reason behind the review was expectations that the central bank would keep the key interest rate stable this week,” said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this point,” he said.
If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of those involved in financial markets without shaking.
Another expert noted that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said throughout the spring and early summer that he expected to raise interest rates this year, despite the Liberals saying that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month and is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank will calculate as full employment.
Salary income seems to be increasing
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual 2% targets of the central bank, the central bank's decision-makers noted that the key reason for this is the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
“The economy can cope with even higher interest rates and it needs them as long as they take into account the tight situation in the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world did not start to tremble last month as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May, and investors feared that the decline in the Chinese economy would also impact global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now dropped by nearly 10% from the peak in May.
The turmoil in the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank are further complicated to consider raising the key interest rate.
“The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate.
Now he believes the central bank is waiting at least a month to deal with the effects.
“There is great uncertainty as to what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is little reliable data on the situation since the recent development of the Chinese economy,” Oliner said.
The consolidation of the global economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the world’s most influential monetary authority.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow its scope caused upheavals around the world.
In today’s world, markets and economies are closely intertwined. In addition to monitoring world developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
“The decision-making process of the central bank is more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Director of Global Strategy at Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond's regional central bank stated this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem unrelated to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee) has called for an increase in the steering rate, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
“The economic crisis in Asia led to the Central Bank’s decision to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings, although only limited recognisable sanctions were available for US economic growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed the decision.
“The central bank should only put monetary stability at the forefront of a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Committee.
The latest turmoil does not even approximate the situation at that time, he said.
“In no way should we be afraid of raising interest rates because of the shock of the market,” added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
“The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability.

The Brazilian Rio Grande Pediatric Association promotes a proper diet for breastfeeding women
The Brazilian Rio Grande Pediatric Association SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach nursing women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies who are breast-fed from the breast, painted with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This allows the baby to get all the nutrition it needs and to develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calorie intake, other changes in diet should be made.
A recent study by Dr. Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, revealed that a healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the genes of the baby and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the immune system of the child.
Seven's Sunrise has the highest number of viewers, although Nine is trying to catch the lead on his Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would urge Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership election, however, which did not much improve Today's ratings.
Nine channel's morning program was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The morning program of the rival channel, led by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London. The week-long special broadcasts of the program are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance was apparently of no importance to Australian television viewers, as Sunrise had an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, and the Today program had 339,000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly from last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but remained from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, while Sunrise had 330,000 viewers.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
This morning, the winds of change will affect Parliament more.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

A notable novelty for Seven was the 800 Words new series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children. The new series reached a staggering 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough to star in the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor retained its strong position with 1,16,000 spectators. The series brightly defeated The Block (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
From the first half of the new quiz series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30) followed an average of 446,000 viewers.
On the second half-hour (17.30-18.00) the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase in the first half of Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half attracted a staggering 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat's attendance was 620,000.
The Chase Australian second-night ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will pass by another 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

Sam Wood is a bachelor of dreams, but who does he choose?
Was the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski perhaps inadvertently revealed the choice of the bachelor of dreams.
The final choice of the bachelor of dreams, Sam Wood, has been a well-kept secret.
The three remaining women do not whine a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We questioned the moods of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before dropping one out of the trio.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women said that Wood was the perfect man. The women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity, and considered him to be the perfect partner for his qualities.
When asked who would be the most suitable companion for Wood, if the last rose did not hit the spot, their answers could give an indication of who would take the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been easy since the beginning.
“As soon as I got into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit well together. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah has feet on the ground, and she’s really fun to be around,” Markoski added.
“I’ve seen them together, and I have to admit there’s chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay considers herself and Sam Wood a good partner.
Mackay said he realized on a hometown date last week that Wood could be the one.
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race. Now I’m investing in our relationship to the fullest extent,” Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he did not choose him, the woman mysteriously replied:
I can’t say, he said.
I like other girls just as much.
The bachelor of dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting a NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after he moved to the United States. Several other clubs also became interested in the man after last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as was the case for the man in the Australian rugby national team. Hayne fumbled the return situation of the air kick after the team took the win on Tuesday from Minnesota reading 20 to 30.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man a new opportunity to return the jet kick, and the coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the locker room after the game.
He did not rob the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, but encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
Cam Inman, a specialist editor at the 49ers, reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne sparks the capture of the Minnesota Vikings game in the first quarter.
Hayne and her Australian fan crew had expected something else from the man's NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field in a rainy manner and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more miserable start to his NFL career.
“These things happen, and we have to move on,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the mistake with his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his pitch in his own territory opened a seat for Queensland.
Overall, the experience was incredible for a 27-year-old boy.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram, posing with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, the man-owned oil company Yukos was arrested, and his pro-democracy work was restricted.
Four dead after police shot with rubber bullets protesters in Nepal
Four people died in southern Nepal, a source said Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a crowd in an alleged unconstitutional demonstration of the country. Among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than 300 km from the capital Kathmandu.
According to district chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal reported that police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It’s not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive alternative, suddenly were so deadly.
This was the latest clash in weeks of protests on the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have died in violent skirmishes since August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, this is an important step towards a new constitution, but the issue is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been working since 2008, but legislative measures accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the devastating earthquake in April.
Legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Katmandu this week, and officials say the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde

According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear center of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles. It can also be 60% likely to develop into a tropical cyclone over the next two days.
Google to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations helping thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of running, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
“We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migrant crisis escalates, many families in a similar situation are in dire need of help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations Refugee Agency.
After donations have been collected via google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the equivalent amount, bringing the total amount to $11 million.
The European refugee crisis has been at its worst since World War II, especially the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly Overweight Diabetics May Benefit From Obesity Surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those who are receiving surgical treatment.
“It takes time to get the mortality data,” said Robin Blackstone, a doctor of obesity surgery, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by various methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have concerned morbidly overweight individuals with a BMI of at least 35.
The body mass index indicates the weight and length of the normal range from 18.5 to 14.9.
When the body mass index is above 25, the person is overweight, and the body mass index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the average body mass index fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of research.
The body mass index of patients treated with no surgery remained close to 29.
Patients treated for surgery had a total improvement in diabetes by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part only by about 2%.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical treatment group.
The researchers also monitored patients' haemoglobin-A1c levels, which describes the development of blood sugar levels.
According to the researchers, the recommended haemoglobin level of A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the mean reduction in haemoglobin-A1c was 9% to 6%.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged at approximately 8%.
However, a team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over a five-year period.
The research team also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
During the fifth year, in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the body mass index drop was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as was the hemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%).
However, according to a Swedish study at the University of Arizona College of Medicine at Phoenix, the surgical treatment brings years of life to obese people.
In a Swedish study, those obese people who underwent gastric bypass surgery had a 29 percent reduction in mortality over 15 years compared to the group receiving traditional treatment.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone confirmed that people with a body mass index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
“This is the most important finding in the study, as it states that surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease,” Blackstone said.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when they have a body mass index of 27-30.
“We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously,” the researcher said.
When a person’s body has accumulated genetic changes that predispose him to obesity and diabetes, it’s really hard to turn the situation around.
Not everyone can come to Europe - the Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, saying that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan leader in Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama delivered his speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that, although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this situation.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” the Dalai Lama said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts made by Germany and Austria in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education,” the Dalai Lama said.
After all, we need to think about how we can reduce the number of people killed in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
There have never been any problems solved by force, he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that when he resorted to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
“After the September 11 attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution comes through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences — the Dalai Lama said.
Handicraft swallowing cases quadruple in children in four years
According to the Georgian Poisoning Center, poison centers across the United States report an almost quadruple in children under 12 years of age with high alcohol levels of handicraft swallowing since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poisoning Center, cases of handicraft swallowing reported to poison centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children have to go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hand sanitizers intentionally, some to impress their friends, and some to incite social media.
YouTube videos feature teenagers who drink disinfectant because of cheap hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcohol-containing mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can attract the smell of handicrafts.
“The child doesn’t think the substance is bad,” Lopez said.
“Most of the attractive handmade products are just perfumed.
There are hand sanitizers with strawberry, grape and orange flavors that appeal to children -
The alcohol content of disinfectants is 45-95%.
For young children, a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
“The alcohol content of the hands is very high,” Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poison Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
No one would leave a whiskey shot available to children, but if hand disinfection products are often left available to children, they will quickly produce a large amount of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old, recently enjoyed four ruffles of strawberry scented hand sanitizers at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
“The girl’s blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice as high as the adult hop limit,” said Dr. Chris Ritchey of the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah soured and couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as the girl had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol, Ritchey said.
“The situation was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol swabs in addition to moving your hands beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizers containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported as an active substance in the product description.
According to a police report, three fourth-grade students in the northern part of New York state planned to kill an evil teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handicrafts and prohibited it from being brought into the classroom.
The police felt that the plan was meaningless and called for disciplinary action by the school.

The Dutch need an old Scottish fighting pair - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that the interest of Dutch football fans towards Celtic has fallen because no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers duels.
De Boer, a team leader at Ajax, said: “There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland.
Since the Rangers are no longer with us,

Warburton Careful in January Player Transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January's player transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer roulette and says he wants to compromise the team's unity.
“January player transfers are significantly different from summer transfers,” Brentford’s former coach said.
“The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been a success in our lineup this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player purchases can do more harm to the team than good.

The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the average employment rate in the whole of the United Kingdom being 73.5%.
Scottish Minister for Foreign Affairs David Mundell commented on the recent figures: “The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a strong economy”
Almost exactly a year ago Scotland made a historic decision to preserve as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has declined.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
I received an invitation in January through a man’s best friend and despite my shock, I responded in the affirmative.
As the day approaches, I am terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell the real story about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Reporters are allowed to watch executions in the United States, and because there are more applications than seats, participants are selected by macabre raffle.
Oklahoma has cut journalists from 12 to 5.
The chosen ones follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've been talking on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to prison staff, I cannot be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I am not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to put the details into my mind.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of putting neutrality at risk on Twitter.
Here's the basic idea:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him.
I gave the reporter my dissenting opinion.
The journalist admitted that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but still considers my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't obey.
I have told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
He wants to see an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes a movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, editor of the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that the man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
An impartial description can be read in other reporters' cases.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die in vain.
Man lured from Canning River after watery police hunt
An officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry to lure a man up the Canning River.
The Perthian man's escape attempt was in the shallow, muddy water. A few meters away, the police got the man back to the dry land.
Canning Vale police received a call Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arriving, police found a suspect who tried to shake off the police by heading to the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
“The man standing in the water announced he would not come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water,” Sgt. Shandell Castledine told reporters.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia's suit of service did not attract watering, so he chose a safer tactic - negotiation.
\"Sometimes an attempt to escape leads a person to resort to amusing means,\" Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
According to Peter Moody, officials tried to spy, and he threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria's agents of spying on his stables last year, threatening to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that officials and the Incorruptibility Department of Racing Victoria have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to treatment recently given on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to work for competitive sports. Moody has faced a difficult situation when cobalt was found in Lidar's sample, and the man was unable to explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue in control of espionage charges for a year and a half, and did not want the accusations to affect the actions of a bitter man.
“I wasn’t going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration erupts once and for all,” Moody said.
They know what really happened.
Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want to walk upright, and I want the owners of the horses to believe that I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't want to be a horse coach anymore.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach.
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told about attempts to spy on the integrity department in his garage.
“One and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions. I’ll tell him his name when asked,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe I am a fraud.
If that is the case, they should present the evidence, because I have not been caught for anything unauthorized.
Former RVL president Robert Roulston, current RVL president David Moodie, and current RVL CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and assume responsibility for the situation in the sector for non-coachers?
Do I harm the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'd still get a training license and push me out of my job, and there's no doubt that what I'm saying will make a lot of people think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's sad.
It's really sad.
I urge them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw...
The long-standing investigation of Lidar's cobalt values and the recent rejection situation eventually frustrated the coach so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of unbeaten champion Black Caviar. The man described the rule of care for the race day as ridiculous after a clay wrap was placed on the horse's feet in violation of the rules.
- It's against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that, Moody said.
“A person in my staff mistakenly put clay on the horse’s foot.
Clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it did.
But it happened on the day of the race...
Moody can be expected to face a three-month ban on non-compliant clay treatment, which the organizers have begun to investigate.
This is a joke.
The rules are drawn up by someone who knows no horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Arrested for escape from Cobram crash site
Police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist this weekend who escaped from the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he suffered serious injuries after a car collided with him at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the man who drove the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalaas reported to the Shepparton police.
A man is likely to be charged with neglecting stop and assistance obligations in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
A 40-year-old biker from Cobram is still in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Refers to Opponents' Wrestling Talks
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy considers criticizing his team's tackle game as a purpose-oriented action by the NRL's two league favorites.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, judges gave Storm wrestling to the annoyance of Melbourne hosts winning a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered the reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifying final in Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a model match and stated that Queensland did not care more about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they only focused on contact when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that the coach of the two top teams criticized his team. Bellamy considers this to be an indication that coaches worry about losing to Storm.
“I think Trent Robinson didn’t say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24 to 30,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense system or techniques all year. For the last six weeks, we've only invested in contact games and tackles, which has turned us up.
Trent has been on his mission for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It’s funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what was interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting - Bellamy said.
“In 2010, St George received a lot of criticism for his boring game, and Wayne said that the criticism didn’t stop him at all.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast central attackers.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play with his style, and not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that Storm and Roosters scored more goals than when they met Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos' game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was between 20 and 18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting for football?
Or are the game breaks and low-goaling interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them...
Stormi has a free weekend as the team will be visiting either North Queensland Cowboys on Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be available Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed on $200,000 bail in drug case
A man in custody of a 40-pound shipment of cocaine smuggled into Queensland for a possible life sentence has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a hundred kilos of cocaine on a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomera in August.
Police observed a meeting between Maximovic and an accomplice in the marina for the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse. A batch of 40 kilos of drugs was found in the Toyota Echo car at the parking lot.
Although Maximovic may be awaiting life for possession of the drug for commercial purposes, according to the man's lawyer, there is no evidence that his client was trying to take possession of the whole lot, but the man may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will attempt to flee the country.
“Maksimovic has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia — a judge said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bail against which the man was released.
“After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it’s clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
However, that alone is not enough to prevent a man from escaping, the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and stays home from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl’s phone to capture pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and signed up for an online messaging service where he made another user send him inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, after waking up, the girl noticed that the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
After examining the computers found at the site, police found disturbing Internet searches using search terms to retrieve inappropriate child pictures.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead the pedophiles on the Internet and that he was presenting the police with the intention of scaring the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said in a local court at the Dundee Sheriff Court: “The man claimed to be dependent on intimidation of people.
He admitted that he did the searches on a computer, but claimed that he did so to portray the police and thus to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead the pedophiles.
He said he got disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “After finding the messages on the phone, the girl screamed at her mother, shaking and crying.
The girl saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, and Hogg was interrogated.
She said the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road pleaded guilty to the charges of possession of inappropriate child pictures on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his release from bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed in the sex offender register, as it can be considered that the crime did not contain any significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October due to social work background reports.
Hogg was granted immunity from bail in this case, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sex offenders even before the date of the conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes the wrong speech in parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the stairs to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of the incident spread quickly on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by allegations by opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted the President's speech on the state of affairs in Parliament, which was the same speech that the President made on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
“The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is titled ‘Death’,” Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer immune.
The party’s leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, is concerned about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut between 25,000 and 10,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the business services business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and separates the computer and printer business from the faster growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
According to HP, the company will record $2.7 billion in non-recurring expenses from the fourth quarter.
“The reorganizations will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who will lead the company after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than HP today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies move into a new business style,” Whitman said.
As our own company, our position is better than ever and we can better meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of over $50 billion and focuses on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
Founded by Stanford University, raised by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s, the company now splits into two. The two founded an electronic company in a garage in Palo Alto, now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive reorganizations as traditional desktop computers are transitioning to mobile devices.
The changes made by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in the industry where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: Team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will definitely have to skip at least the next four England national team games, and with the knowledge of the man's history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strongly after an ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new season.
“This type of injury does not threaten a career,” Wenger said.
The bone didn't heal properly.
This is not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries.
Medically, this may be the case, but, as Wenger said, further injuries may occur when the player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different troubles since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in only 65 of a total of 157 league games over the last five seasons.
Arsenal's broader picture is that from 2007 to 2007, from six of the eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams that lost the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the injury statistics improved last season will continue to develop for the better.
“Sometimes, returning after an injury may involve a vulnerable period of time when you need to strengthen your body and seek competitive advantages,” Wenger said.
Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it, his career will continue as he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League contract Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger is preparing small changes to the line-up.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely starters.
Wenger can also place Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting line-up to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to take care of the balance of the team and give rest to those who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite to continue the F-Group, Maximir Zagreb has some of the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for 41 games for the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night as the ground trembled at a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson from last season after having to bend to Monaco. He is also still motivated by a distant desire to pilot the team towards the European Championship.
“We have a huge energy charge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has not yet won this title.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I am also a realist.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially given the fact that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics for young men are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 25 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) addresses the problem by declaring 2015 as the year of men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, people with depressive symptoms have better chances of getting better if there are enough healthy people around them.
In addition, the probability of developing asymptomatic people falling ill was halved if there were people close to them who had no mental health problems.
However, it is all based on friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalization of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The superficial success is related to external values, money, image and social status. All of these take attention from internal values and our innate desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A video game millionaire recently stated that money can’t really buy happiness.
The great thing about the Friends was that the series turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality. This was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously performed by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often miss Rachel. It was clear that the men were able to relate to this, even if they did not refrain from feeling full.
One volunteer explained this to me: “When I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems.
“Friends are one of those series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can offer help from the outside in a moment of despair, but long-term support comes from a close circle of friends and family.
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set of the show has been brought to life. So if you are attending the event this weekend, you should take your friends for coffee to Central Perk.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central broadcasts the entire Friends series - all 236 episodes - in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the attack when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by beating Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of playing the debut game. She strengthened the position of the French champions immediately in the handshake. However, PSG screwed up several goal spots before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted after 60 minutes of playing the game.
The A-block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so the PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG not only seeks a sequel in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its positions for the quarter-final in three remaining games.
Although SPG caught the score, the match was not a complete act of a team piloted by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost a goal representation position and the man was forced to change when faced with his former home club, where the man began his staggering career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win and good grips give us a good foundation, even if we still have something to do for the season,” Blanc said.
This is good.
I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after injury. The team had to settle for a 2-1 draw in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux over the weekend. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in his shadow at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, moved from Manchester United to PSG, was named a solutionr for PSG, which takes the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the nomination as he rushed the ball from Marco Verratt's pitch past Malmö's defense and then fired an accurate hit to the back corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
However, the PSG's anticipated victory was disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international level players to the field since the start. The team playing with five men's defense and two attackers' tactics was difficult to beat.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot narrowly passed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back post in the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very actively.
Instead, PSG succumbed to unnecessary pitching and weak finishing, not least by Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Right at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick was baited by goal for the vices of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his claws in the pitching game. After Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria shot a spiral kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
Another goal was created during the Count's time thanks to Cavan. A Uruguayan who played sixth season shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic pitched him the left winger Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's Kiri ended in the second goal, and only the shot fired by Wiland's top defense David Luiz from close range had to be controlled, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was abandoned at the very end.
Malmö pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in his class. - We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Qualifying is not enough.
Hats off to the Parisians.
This was a great match for them.
Glencore to raise $2.5 billion
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which was tested by falling commodity prices, raised US$2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that he had sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to reduce debt.
The company’s market value fell by 57 per cent this year and is struggling with a collapse in the price of raw materials, as the Chinese economy’s recession hampers demand and puts a strain on the market.
With the share issue, Glencore's share price reached the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to a 0.69% increase.
Glencore announced last week that it plans to raise $2.5 billion with a share issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 cents, which is a 2.4 per cent decrease in the closing price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the Group.
Concern about the continuation of the Chinese economic downturn has caused the iron ore price to collapse by half, while the decline in coal, copper and other commodities has been 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
A White House statement released Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on September 25, a counter-visit following President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
After bilateral discussions between the heads of state, the President of the United States and Presidential spouse Michelle Obama arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan in honor of the state visit.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues of mutual interest — as stated in the White House Communication.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February, and he is expected to drop by Seattle to meet several American engineering leaders. From Seattle, the president's trip would continue to Washington and from there to New York to the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased activity in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon spoke intensely with African-American Effie Brown and stated that diversity is not needed behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he explained how important it is to take into account the different views on the project on the black protagonist of the selected script.
“Diversity is taken into account in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the show,” Damon said.
Brown glared and injured at the claim. —Wow, that’s clear — the woman stated that the Alone on Mars movie starred after Damon’s comment.
Damon and Brown had gathered with other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
“Whoever the director is, I would like to encourage you to think about how Harmony’s character is portrayed,” Brown said.
The only black figure is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as director of the film. Damon harshly replied that the choice of the two could lead to an undesirable outcome.
When the conversation aired on television, social media exploded from Damon's disapproval comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger over the scene in direct words: “The fact that Matt Damon is talking to the only black person to explain what diversity is is is so whiteish that it hurts —
Tweets were shared more than 5,000 times, and liked it 4,000 times.
Damon’s comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of the human races in the media is one of the top topics to talk about.
Following the death of teenager Michael Brown from a white police bullet in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained support across the country. The movement seeks to end discriminatory treatment of lawmakers and blacks by authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement as presenting the album nominees of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Just like books and black people's lives, albums still matter.
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fow News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether that group should be described as a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love,” the movement’s management said.
Damon is one of those entertainment artists, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known if Damon has responded in the affirmative.
American Ninja Warrior's first winner
The professional climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed a million dollars for his win.
For the first time in the seventh season that just ended the TV series, all the assigned tasks were cleared.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten survived the final round.
In the final task, the men had to pain up to a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task in the given time. He was the first competitor to complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race with approval. However, Caldiero performed the task three seconds faster and became the winner.
After a tough fight, Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after catching a million dollar pot.
“The winning amount is incredible because I’ve never made more than $10,000 a year,” he said in an interview with E!.
“Suddenly, I can’t even imagine what’s going to happen, the future is wide open.”
Lead producer Kent Weed spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to have cleared all tasks.

Detroit Tigers win over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers have no particularly pleasant experiences in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of the best teams in Baseball, are now in the final place of the American League Central.
However, the team succeeded on Tuesday by beating the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
Twins lost their chance to get to the Houston Astros to fight for the second wild card slot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even if only for one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind the rock in the second half of the season.
“Every win is a nice win, no matter how it’s achieved,” Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon stood up when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and again in the ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 turns for a good game and allowed three runs.
He's only had three good starts with nine outside shifts.
“I just want to finish the season strongly this year,” Simon said.
“It’s hard for a changer to throw in every game, and that’s why I want to feed until the sixth turn.”
Tigers pitcher substitute kicker Victor Martinez received three hits and hit two runs, which were his first beats since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first night of three hits since he received four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He hit well,” Ausmus said.
He looks good in batting practice, and he kept his head up in the game.
In the latter turn of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Byron Buxton started the shift by hitting two nests close to the left flank.
The real catcher Aaron Hicks struck the sacrifice beating, and Simon took second place with Brian Dozier, who took three straight passes before being replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a break for Mauer, a new pitcher's surrogate, Miguel Sano, hit two nests, followed by a right-handed Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners on the field, VerHagen got three Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The Major League team led for the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had struck a verification run on the first turn of the ninth turn, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon struck a two-run punch, and the situation was 5-8.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight passes and was able to hold the position of his team.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes being a little rusty.
Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran who had just gotten back from the injured list into the fields. The man was sidelined for a month due to a back infection.
“Of course, the beginning wasn’t what I would have hoped for. But as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do a good job and a few good pitches in the third inning,” Hughes said.
Upon taking the lead, Hughes gave a single nest hit second to Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real catcher J.D. Martinez's free game brought Victor Martinez the first imported run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 tube was cut off when the team had players on the nests.
Nick Castellanos of the third was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned as he attempted to advance to three.
Tigers increased their lead in the second inning. Catcher James McCann survived the hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first base, when the situation was 3-0.
- That's a pretty good hit - commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
In the pitching shift was Hughes, who pitched a pointless third inning, after which he was replaced by his right-handed substitute kicker A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance was three runs, six hits, a free pass and four straight passes.
Notable: Tigers right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not involved in the line-up due to a batting shoulder rupture.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list due to a shoulder rupture since mid-August, and was scheduled to be included on Wednesday.
When Sanchez does not play, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the injured list and is included in the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris has received 1 to 4 games since being traded to his left-handed batter David Price on July 30.
He has been out of line-up since August 20th due to an oblique abdominal muscle rupture.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) receives Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
