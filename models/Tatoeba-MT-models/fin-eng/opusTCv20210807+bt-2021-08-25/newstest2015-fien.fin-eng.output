The City of Juankoski will join the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the union on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the union last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the settlement of the municipal joint venture, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide separately on the implementation of the next municipal elections.
Municipal elections will be held for the next time in 2016.
After joining Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of about 111,000.

India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev's leadership of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct an essential political dialogue with the eastern part of its country,\" Putin said in a statement.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, who say Kiev and the West are assisted by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The goal of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so they don’t get the chance to shoot the people in the area, Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Korjaamo.
I was surprised that the crowd came in early.
There were visitors during the two days as expected, promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We’re still going to be hip-hop festivals, which means that there’s no pop, Kangas assures.
A law will enter into force in Finland on Tuesday restricting the purchase of suitable explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the National Police Board for permission to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a precursor for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and mixtures containing them, if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide is present, for example, in cleaning and detergents, but concentrations usually do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used for acceleration, for example.
However, precursors obtained before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster Accused of Nairn and Pitlochry Hotel Rape
The accused of rape in two hotels is facing trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at the Glasgow High Court.
He is accused of rape at Pitlochry's Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire province on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman in her unconscious state, sleeping, and thus unable to make a decision on her own.
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View Hotel in Highlands, Nairn, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the Supreme Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shines - Mario missed out - Premier League - Evening-Sanomat
It wasn't until 19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed why he is considered the hope of the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, strengthened at Mario Balotelli, arrived as Tottenham's guest.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of his sixteen pitches to his own team.
Pool supporters, who have already become the player's favorite, expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team's star sparked the tip of the midfield diamond Raheem Sterling, who poked past an important opening goal of a 3-0 win by Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine.
An Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than a Balotelli is between the opposing lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who speeds around 34 km/h on the grass at its best.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman explained how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from a north-western Londoner who grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra -- I am happy and proud --
The City Board of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra as of autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times has asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she will start her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in the music life of our country for more than a century, for example by performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many orchestra members before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm, he says.
Employees' organisations' boards gather in pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new impetus for pension negotiations is being sought today from the labour market organisations' own meetings.
The SAK, Akava and STTK administrations will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations will continue.
Labour market organisations have been chastised, among other things, by the dispute over the binding of the retirement age to life expectancy.
Organizations have promised a career solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimate, it would be born this week.
Pedestrian.
The women's volleyball league team Woman Volleyball from Rovaniemi stumbled on the league champion Vampula's athletes to Pähtiputa in the final of the practice tournament on Sunday.
The Vampula turned a stretched match into five 3-2 wins.
Last round WoVo lost 15-11.
My neighbor was one step ahead of me.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and in the passport game, Vampula was a little better,” WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
WoVo's six were in the sense that the 190-cent American centimeter Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck on the side.
Sara Niemi played as the center.
Karoliina Kyllönen, despite her thumb injury, was able to play and formed WoVo’s most firepower combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a chipper, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the Vampula was the skilled Russian passport and the Libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next week as Hämeenlinna’s HPK enters training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet again at the sports college.
Lidl forges wild figures in Finland
The turnover of the company’s stores in Finland grew by almost 25 per cent during the financial year ending in February to nearly EUR 1.2 billion.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is expected to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has more than 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often fatal in sparsely populated areas due to a delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the patient records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after the diagnosis.
Susan Jordan QIMR of the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
SMALL INQUIRY: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers reviewed women’s health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, past illnesses and socio-economic status also contributed to the chance of survival.
In older women and with cancer becoming more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20% more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers it possible to have delayed diagnosis and difficulty getting treatment.
“Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly in large cities,” Jordan said.
Although remote care treatments are becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programs to support patients who are being treated far from home.
According to a study by Dr. Jordan, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old family mother living in Gold Coast, Eliza Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its snowmobile parking operations in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhovi.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the town plan proposal for the Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be made available to the public at the service point Osviena.
Statements on the draft plan are requested from the Environmental Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
Through the change in the station plan, the city wants to enable the tourism-related snowmobile activities to continue in the area.
A park area is planned to be built on the site, which includes the area between the current Friendship Park and its river.
Between 15 November and 30 April, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available.
You may also place refueling points on a specified part of the area.
The new park area is also allowed maintenance services.
The City of Rovaniemi has leased the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The lease agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and the agreement is valid until spring 2018.
Snowmobile parking and the change in formula have raised even loud opposition.
The residents of the neighbouring apartment buildings have been sore about both the vote and the emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been studied, and no observations have been made that exceed the guidelines.
The new equipment is also lower than the old one.
The friendship park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were to be moved further away, the hotel’s safari guests should be transported to the starting points of the safaris by buses, which would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and the surrounding area of the friendship park is also large enough for the snowmobiles, better than the places presented as replacement starting places, such as the eastern side of the boat pier on the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendship park is good for its location, even because the activities can expand in the future, for example in the Ounaspaviljong area.
The consolidation of parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the City Council of Rovaniemi, according to which the city’s objective is, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally low-cost locations.
The friendship park is marked as the starting point for snowmobiles also in the city centre’s partial general plan, which has not yet received legal force.
The fall in owner-occupied housing is visible in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under 35 years of age, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions, as today’s young consumers reach their age on behalf of garden sales — the main target group — the Financial Times reported on a study by the British Garden Trade Association (HTA).
According to a report by the Financial Times, apartment renters spend only 55 percent of the money spent by homeowners on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is reduced as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. Also, these factors threaten the garden area, with an estimated value of about £5 billion per year.
In the Greater London area, house ownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, with the least money spent on horticultural products per household in the whole country.
According to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), however, an increase in housing rental or a decrease in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
RHS’s leading garden counselor, Guy Barter, says that — for example, plants grown in transferable breeding vessels are particularly popular among apartment renters, as such breeding vessels can be included in the change if necessary —
According to HTA's report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period in garden resale, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, worse than last year’s March and April weather.
Turkey interrogates US diplomat over espionage report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has invited the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy's Treasurer and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and online newspaper The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main target for spying on US and UK intelligence services.
Turkish news agencies say Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major states have been spying on each other.
A previous report on espionage directed at Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in new Finnish film
In several successful films, Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze has been attached to the female lead in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights into the morning, whose filming starts this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actress award for her role in the 2003 Barbarian Invasion.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's film Munich and Julian Schnabel's film Butterfly in a glass dome.
Two Nights to Morning film starring Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
The defendants presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià City Government officials at the Majorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvià, on the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by shop owners and bar owners in the known Magaluf region.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was put in custody after several shop owners of Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him. On Punta Ballena Street, most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who reported the case provided evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià City Government officials at the Office of the Prosecutor's Office against Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are being interrogated by a judge along with Navarro.
ABC, a daily newspaper throughout the country, wrote that nightclub owners were outraged by the bias of the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
“It’s no longer money, it’s survival,” a shop owner told the court.
You don't destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was a newspaper headline in several countries this summer when a YouTube video was distributed online, in which an 18-year-old British vacationer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island's authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the notorious, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and a fine of €55,000 was imposed on the nightclub owner and pub crawl organiser Carnage jointly.
Above all, among young British tourists, the popular tourist attraction of Magaluf has also become popular with the so-called balconing trend, which has caused a number of alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket-bombed southern Israeli communities, but the traces of fighting are still visible.
In the town of Ashdod in the south, in the Pashosh kindergarten, workers removed fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the kindergarten.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that going back to school after a long time feels a bit strange.
“We’ve had some difficult times when we didn’t leave home,” he said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the ceasefire began last week, thousands of residents of communities in the Saad-like border area had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas farther from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Front are suspicious of the return after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families are currently placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border, which was subject to heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study diligently and promised that —the education and safety of children —
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' demand for the removal of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the body of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt expects a new round of indirect negotiations to begin later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the number of deaths, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the Israeli side, including a Thai employee.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelter in over 100 UN-maintained schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelter and fighting continuing, school officials moved the school's beginnings the previous week.
“I hope the school opens soon and we get to school again, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children,” said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, a sheltered school in the city of Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to RP data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose by 4.2% in June, July and August, i.e. more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months before August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the rise in prices.
RP Data results show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% and in Melbourne by 11.7% the year before.
The housing market in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin is next busiest; the average price increase is five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of apartments for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in sales of apartments to be auctioned, the overall high sales rate and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months,” Lawless said.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have attracted record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has featured classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä Art Weeks said on Monday that they had set a visitor record when 14,500 interested people had visited the Wait event this summer.
These figures are not used to.
People have been shoveling through doors and windows, says Director Pauli Sivonen of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will reach 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen points out that new museums are always phenomena when they open up.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
We hope that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani over the last four days.
On Sunday night, a commercial property in Pohjolankatu was broken into by breaking a window.
He had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel had been stolen from the truck tank on Syväojankatu.
A boat and its outboard engines had been taken from Petäisenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside it was written on the front side.
A couple of suspects have already been arrested by the police.
Sunday night, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
A police dog got a mark and a man in his twenties was found hiding under a tree in a forest.
On Monday, police arrested another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of having committed the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine charged with murder in Kajaani
The disappearance of a batch of amphetamines of less than ten grams brought a murder charge on a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and shot the owner of his suspected drug-exporter apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that another man was with him as the shooter.
The incident became known to police when a police patrol stopped a car in which a party was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a cut-out shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a verdict on the matter later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August repeats on average once every ten years.
The statistics of the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most of the country, the deviation was from one to two degrees.
Due to the heat of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature for the whole summer was measured in Pori in the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees Celsius.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to a seven-child immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, British Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and the relationship between the boy and the father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap in an upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She has been in therapy many times since her mother died, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said, “Stop the noise.”
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm watching cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer stove or the beauty of cricketing.
I never talked to him about such things.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, thus gaining an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, although working conditions are better today than at the time.
The melting houses are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthic depths, where flames, smoke, and soot burst and bring to mind the hell.
Dad used to go to the bath and just lie down in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the dirt of the melthouse away from himself.
As I walked around the Melthouse, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked the proximity that parents offered.
My father never hugged and never said he loved me.
It wasn’t until my mother started getting sick a little before she died that we started saying to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep repeating, I love you?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry is still a good friend of French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the death of the mother.
As I began to suffer from excessive obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full turn.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And boring.
No one likes eating carrots.
Henry's known, short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics on his role as Othello, he is immersed in the making of the theatre.
Next up was the Comedy of Mistakes and August Wilson's Fences —Fences —Fences.
Making a theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedy Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started working in the industry when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ spotted him on stage making impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's television career began in the mid-1970s. For a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV, he tells.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, learn to make jokes from the assembly line between 1975 and 1985, while I was living stardom and on television.
Lenny New Faces in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where the characters appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and reprehensible, I got to work at huge events and learned how to deal with the audience.
Yet the award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment show on British TV was at the same time a grotesque parody of black people.
Henry worked in the '80s in the second comedy series, where both mocked and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the decade following that with commercials, documents, TV shows, and movie parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv show shown on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, “What you’re going to do next, Len, now it seems like you’re just pedaling in your seat or going by sidetracks —
Next up was the Radio 4 documentary series - What's So Great About....
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught us properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class who wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me, “Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Dating words and understanding why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
“This is what it’s all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
The play was ultimately a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but that was not quite the case.
Soon after, Henry played the lead role in the Comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was playing at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it.
At one point, I thought, \"Oh, you've changed...
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A little voice in my mind said to me, ‘You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’”
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation will be continued as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and a part of me sighed at the relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others.
You're part of the play. Stay in your role.
Henry - Fences
Learning the lines to play “Fences” was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This play, too, was well received, so it was as if a sign from the gods; this is what you must do.
Of course, Henry says this with a loud voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: little boys with humor constantly interrupt our conversations as he switches from one impression to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as receiving instant thanks from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you are constantly craving it, it can lead to an impasse.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general it no longer inspires me in the same way as before.
I'll ask Henry if he's gonna go on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit together with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I’d ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting.
It's really funny.
The story is constantly being told, and I enjoy it.

Kenya prepares a register of civil servants to remove — ghost workers —
Kenya has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove — ghost workers — from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive a salary, a government announcement was announced.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after they leave their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, salaries and other financial abuse by ghost workers cost at least $1 million a month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left his official post, BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reported on the capital Nairobi.
All officials must report themselves to the register within the next few weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration format, the government said in a statement.
According to the press release, anyone who fails to do this for no reason is removed from the payroll.
“This measure significantly rationalises the public sector, as it defines how many people actually perform their duties. In addition, it cleans the payroll at both levels of the government. This solves the problem of ghost workers,” says Anne Waiguru, a cabinet official at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result for the financial year 2015 in Seinäjoki may be EUR 25.5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about 9.4 million in deficit.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to compromise the scope and level of services, as well as to purchase services, sales and grants of assets, and to increase tax and payment income.
Of the EUR 10 million reduction target for investments, the total amount is EUR 8.5 million.
There is no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increased unemployment and a 5% cut in central government shares further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The City Council agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to a strategic goal,” says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals to the Management Team for further preparation.
The proposals of the City Board are the basis for budget preparation at the council’s economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal progresses through the panel process to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested on suspicion of plot against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspected - of plots against the government - local media sources report.
Police did not immediately comment.
The Hurriyet Daily News reported that there were 14 high-ranking police officers among those arrested.
Some of the police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a large amount of crime and tracking telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister during that time) said the actions of the police were part of a planned action against him and other ruling figures by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukov, who serves as a leading teacher at Slaviansk school, where Yatsynyuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children can learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
Celebrations on the first day of school traditionally include children's embroidered shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
Perry, Texas, said the abusive tweet was unauthorized.
A defamatory image of a Democrat district attorney was sent from Texas Governor Rick Perry's verified Twitter account on Sunday evening while hearing allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed, followed by a new tweet in which Perry vowed that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
“I don’t accept the tweet and I’ve deleted it,” a later release said.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a defamatory cartoon about Rosemary Lehmberg, Travis' district attorney, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, leading to a large jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet was, \"I don't always drive drunk, three times allowed for higher proms... But when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing a finger...
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor at San Antinio, who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry said he was innocent and called the charges a political plot.
His powerful legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the allegations and said that the law under which the governor of Texas's longest-running office is unclear, mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state subsidies to a public inviolability unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted the left-wing monitoring group to lodge a formal complaint.
Perry’s verified Twitter account is regularly updated — and sometimes also famously.
After reaching fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry vowed to end the tie by posting a photo of himself jogging on the lake with a text — Here I come, South-Carolina — on Twitter.
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again -- normal --
One of London’s most important builders has warned that the housing market in south-eastern England has returned to normal activity levels.
The capital of London has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, causing the Bank of England to impose restrictions on housing loans in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, founder and president of the high-end developer Berkeley, said — since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of transactions have returned to normal since the peak of 2013 — and added that this has enabled — a stable operating environment — to be restored to normal.
The housing market in London went well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to the land register data, house prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by about a fifth the previous year, reaching a price increase of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the confirmed pound has made London's properties less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible -- manor tax -- before the May general election.
Foxtons, a London real estate agent, warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending orders, would lead to lower levels of market growth both in terms of real estate sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans declined in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for real estate prices in London, according to which prices will fall by three per cent because the price index, which measures the opinion of homeowners, has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London, Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has fallen by a quarter since one year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, which increased revenue from properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that — the demand for the best locations for a well-designed, well-designed product has remained stable, and therefore sales have remained high —
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the previous year, which is almost a third more than at the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year, thus increasing £380 million and turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for the year corresponded to current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before tax for the whole year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at a steady price of £23.96.
Hacker leaks nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards award ceremony.
A hacker who claims to be holding images of 100 other stars leaked from Oscar-actress Jennifer Lawrence's naked images online.
The Hunger Games star's representative confirmed that the images are authentic and condemned the hacker -- a rude violation of privacy --
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who releases the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged.
The photos, originally released on the 4chan image release page, had apparently fallen into the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of hundreds of other stars being hacked is claimed to include dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the images are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
For those who look at photos taken years ago by me and my husband in the privacy of our home: I hope you have a good mood - Winstead
However, Victoria Justice of the Nickolodeon - iCarly - and Victoria - series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that - these so-called nude images of me are FALSE, don't you understand -
Let me finish this at the beginning.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of images of the star.
Only the excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter \"J\"
They dissipated, it described the best thing that happened, gradually they fell apart like a box of cardboard left out of the rain.
Only occasionally did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the prick.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The last victim of his spikes had an early relationship, however, which had been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought some content into his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauties with a cheerful heart, from a northern village that was even more barren and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, whom Kevern assumed to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house located in a damp but paradise-like valley, and the name of the valley was conveniently called the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, weeds growing in the garden that resembled giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel, J, was nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver, through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, as Ailinn's crosses, suntanned legs brought to Kevern's mind a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer and which his father had often listened to with cabin blinds down.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually banned — they were just no longer played.
They wanted to be left in oblivion, like the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion achieved what the laws and decrees had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read the memoirs, cookbooks and romances of heroes, in music they favored the ballads.
In the wildness of the day, Kevern began to key a fictional piano and sing a serenad to Ailin's big feet with a bold comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller - Kevern told him, and at the same time naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
His father had always done this before the letter “j” escaped from his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you let the word from your mouth with j start, and you couldn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn’t a fun game then, and it wasn’t.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn’t banned, it wasn’t just played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit shown through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailin's age, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
There was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude, grateful, as being spared by the trade of happiness, the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean ancestry are best suited to entertain and sport, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian continent, they were like naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their task was to make sure that every family had a functional phone that was used to do things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When it came to pass, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of burning flames and fearing that those flames would next reach them, opened restaurants serving labneh yoghurt and burning a pipe of water, and continued their lives looking down at the ground and bored with depression.
Let everyone act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had heard only ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words Kevern just sang had ever been able to put on as music.
Through music, love was expressed.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except maybe the big feet.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the leaves of giant cabbage-headed plants.
Ailinn didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
She thought he was weird already.
He thought it was funny . . . he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of view.
Nothing else to see in the world except Ailinn's huge, crow-black hairstyle.
He didn't want to see anything else.
If you say so, he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said, “I love you,” but it was too early for that.
I find you attractive because of your thick ankles, he was trying to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and got up from his terrace chair and at the same time poured the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
The wine was made only of elderberry flowers, so he could not use it as a cause of the collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to tremble, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
“And your thick head is what pervertedly attracts me to you,” he said.
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both because of his own unnecessary cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did she think she was gonna hit him?
He had never told Kevern about life in the good northern archipelago, where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
It was the same great sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even more pale and diabolical after the incident than their smuggler and scattering grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to beat every woman who would dare to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd still see a thick fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first — kissing had become the most common word describing an erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote of the unimportant love ballads pumping out of the receiver — suck first and then attack.
Kevern also felt that it was too much, for even sucking in itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go, just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through the upstairs window, a man who was the cause of his own heavy life.
Adam left the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who turned his back, bowed, ashamed, beaten, who had lost all the will to fight — why did he feel that vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had ever seen such a sight before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, she looked at her legs.
A few years before the newly described event, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, who worked at the Private Institution of Public Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a brief study of the continued minor and medium-hard violence in the areas of the country where the reduction, or even cessation, of violence was most likely taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
Much has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done, he wrote, so that the natural aggression of the people who fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those abandoned and remote corners, where, despite the church towers over the hedges, human mildness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it generates.
The people weep among sentimental ballads, devour stories of overcome adversities, and swear by the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, old-fashioned cruelty persists in both rural communities and urban cohabitations, and there is also evidence of a new, more evil-souled quarrel in homes, workplaces, streets, and even playgrounds.
“You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize — his director commented after reading the entire report.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to assert his right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
Luther Rabinowitz said, “I am against atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.”
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the Church —and what you call cruelty or evil-souledness, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
To say what happened, if it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, if it ever happened at all, destroys the fundamental vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light declared a guideline that Ofnow had already shared with the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and singing is better than writing, but nothing beats love.
“I understand very well what you want to say — Esme Nussbaum responded in a quiet voice when she was sure her director had finished, and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that initially led to what happened if it happened.
This time, however, we do not shed our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far, he said, to describe as ‘mistakes’ the actions that our grandparents might have done or not done.
You also go too far when you say that they shed their anger and distrust on others.
A person in a position like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was a time of chaos, that’s all we know about it.
“If we are quite honest, in that chaos, Esme ventured to continue, no group of society can say that they behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk more about it, we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do so.
But what does the past exist for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
I'm going through your report, and he said it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcycle rider on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passers-by as evil-souled and furious.
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho military bans planned attack; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials have denied setting up an attack on the overthrow of the government and said they were acting against a police officer who was suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had besieged his official residence and occupied government buildings in Maseru, the capital.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after telling him that he had been threatened with death.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat that came from -- political fanatics -- police have been said to have attempted to arm fanatics.
“Lesotho’s armed forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they are ready to cause problems,” he told Voice of America news agency.
According to the South African government spokesman, Clayson Monyela, the military's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
“Although no party has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be in all respects equivalent to the characteristics of the revolutionary attempt,” he said.
According to Lesotho Army officials, the soldiers return to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing heads the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes he is the target of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements by the large coalition government.
He thus denies his contempt for the power of the government, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft to set up a data center in New Zealand
Microsoft has set up a large data center in a new location that the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent to Microsoft’s media, the company states that it does not disclose the location of all its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been the seat of the centre.
Microsoft is shutting down its Oulu office, which will take the job from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft Communications Director Camilla Lindfors says the company will not comment on how many employees the new data center employs.
On Monday, the company announced the creation of a data centre for Uusimaa.
Man accused of assaulting girl at traffic light crossing

Gordon Stewart is accused of driving a girl at an intersection in Pittenween, eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car carelessly and caused injuries to the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied charges at the Dundee Sheriff's Session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera like Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera like GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both cost about $300.
Personally, I took these photos at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules to follow.
Always check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera battery and other parts are waterproof.
In addition, set the camera shooting settings to match the photos or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize the shooting conditions underwater.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, others can withstand a depth of up to 50-60 feet.
Check out both regular and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take multiple photos, many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose a picture, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is hard to see underwater, and the composition of the image can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows for fork, which means taking multiple images at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is greatly reduced deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while photographing in the swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you will see.
Try to get close to the target.
This is an important advice when filming on land, but even more important under water, because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object in order for the object to fill the entire picture up to the frames.
China won't let Hong Kong choose its leaders, protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament ruled that Hong Kong voters should not elect candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing unrest that calls for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark the long-awaited protests in the Hong Kong business block after activists began planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision was published.
The Chinese People's Congress's decision gives the Communists the power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating,” said Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with autocratic government.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Committee of the People's Congress of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that a general standing as a candidate for a Hong Kong leader would be too - chaotic -
As of 1997, with the UK handing over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents of the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the Nomination Committee, which is administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who — love the country and love Hong Kong — are accepted.
In the summer preceding the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region for years.
Behind the campaign for democracy was largely the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would cause waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details apparently, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, the organizers said that the movement -- sees the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way --
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the taking of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that residents are slowly losing power in their city.
The wave of arrivals from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
In addition, there is a fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong's lifeline - the business world.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many take part in it and how long it lasts,” said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread the concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
Chinese state media have also presented stories that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the henchmen of the revolutionary Western powers -
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
U.S. Prom tradition hits UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing the UK’s first luxury mode of travel for today’s students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, to ensure the most memorable arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, the service also has a security aspect.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in trucks loaded to the extreme.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the easiest and highest quality transportation to the university.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet arrived because the service has just been established, but added that students will start making orders in the next few weeks.
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay tuition fees of £9,000.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the higher education section of the organization - this service plan seems to be very far from the life of the student majority -
Many students start their studies this month as they are shocked by the level of living costs, as the financial support available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the huge increase in basic living costs. Only the next thing you can think about is where thousands can be found to be used for something as simple as arriving on campus.
Ipswich Pig House - for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales photo of a house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a large pig lies in the photo in the living room of the house.
A one-bedroom house with a price of £120,000 is located on a private road in Ipswich.

“However, the picture ended up in the notification by accident and has since been removed,” the company’s representative said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as a unique one-bedroom house.
Although the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it is still visible in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where people have asked if the pig is included in the price of the house.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria protested in front of the Ministry of Justice of the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted to recover the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
The increase in pay is also to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Mr. Ivanov.
For a month, prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours, saying that they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite the meeting of representatives of the prison workers' organisation and the Ministry of Justice, there was no agreement on the matter, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reports.
Negotiations are ongoing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, Director General of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Judgments, told BNR.
The protest by the prison workers' organisation is also expected to involve members of the Ministry of the Interior Workers' Trade Association.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin almost fainted on the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finnish victory today.
He was able to forget his bluster-black U.S. match and beat Ukraine's second-half blood-stopping decisions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was going to go out there at the end of the day, the encouragement was so great.
In the eyes, there was nothing to be done.
The noise and the white ocean were too much for me.
Salin's power moments included nine pins at a fast pace, ball-sucking, plate-scrambled and trickled everywhere that happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flow mode where everything worked out.
They come from somewhere, now to an insanely important place.
That's my role.
Do all that.
Now it was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
It caught the whole gang.
Salin is the team's cheerful and spirit-creator, so it's no wonder his example brought the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big and tough Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after a 32-year hiatus: The previous ones left an outrageous judge's game in mind
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the last time the Finnish men's volleyball team played in the World Cup final.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali as a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as of yesterday: it was a fiery match in the opening block against France.
“In the closing balls of that match, the judge’s game was glaring,” Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled on the backline.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the craps went crazy more than that, said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and eventually finished 17th.
Now Finland is again among the world’s champions, with the Polish World Cup coming up on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The strength values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever, think of Parkkali.
But what will happen in Poland?
The Finnish player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to seeing Finland get off the ground.
Then it can get tough - judge Kosonen.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope this is the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go bust — said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach for the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
The sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.

Finnish tourists rescued the dog from the mountain of Cita in Norway: “These men deserve all thanks”
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dog were in trouble on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
This weekend, Mikkelsen was looking for international heroes on Facebook to thank her helpers once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog in the mountains with him on Thursday hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little further, but its legs just didn’t carry, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, a nearby hotel, or passers-by.
By the end of the night, things were starting to seem threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo from Tampere.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campground when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm about the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog,” Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomat in a message.
Soon, a German man who had a mattress with him came along.
The mattress gave Cita a stretcher-like look to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.
Photo by Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but in difficult terrain the carrying went slowly.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for international heroes to thank them once more.
The Soins responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we probably wouldn't have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn’t thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - Cita said she was feeling better!

Genetic abnormalities are often misdiagnosed
For years, a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth had only a few years left to live because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motors such as muscle weakness, awkward walking, and toe curling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before turning 18 and dying before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that, as a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell every day and it took me longer than everyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten the legs. After the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his research papers, which said he was suffering from FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he said.
When I got information from them, I was shocked and in a panic-like state.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25, and in between, I would slowly lose my full ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers reports that by the age of 17 he stated that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, \"Girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair.\"
I think you are suffering from a much less dangerous disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
“When I was told what CMT was, I thought I was being delayed,” he said.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
Hundreds of migrants found in a coal car in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.
They were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
Migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going,\" Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski said.
According to police, the migrants had paid about 3,000 euros each to get to Greece, and an additional 800-900 euros more to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia with a population of two million people on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

For example, British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie have appealed to the Scottish to remain part of Britain.
In the Gallup, supporters of independence have been defeated.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of land plot to Bottas - value approximately 60000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-acre beach plot to Valtteri Bottas from the shore of Kärkjärvi in Villuhde.
The local government showed a fair sports spirit and was unanimous in its decision.
No sound was heard at the meeting when the plot was decided on, says Mayor Pauli Syrakki.
The Bottas gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
This year, the municipality will remove them, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a leisure home on the property within two years.
We are delighted that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has been to primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
Hopefully it will continue, the mayor said.
The mayor estimates the value of the beach plot to be 40000-6000 euros.
The beach is low and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Throughout the decades, Nastola has successfully managed to keep those successful in sports with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
World Spear Throw Champion Aki Parviainen and Aerobick World Champion Tuuli Matinsalo received private home plots from the municipality and built huge detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola for work and then moved after the life situation changed elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastola, and his situation is different, Syrakki inches and believes that Bottas will remain in his municipality of residence.
Hull hired attacker Hernandez with club record sum
Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguay national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will switch to Hull from the Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The deal is three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and rose to the main series in Italy.
In the Uruguay national team, he has scored seven goals in 14 games.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games for a change to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we’ve come in a short time,” said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he also acquired Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
Russian Space Test Fails to Kill Geckos Sent to Sex Trip
The five small geckos that Russia has sent into space have died, according to Roscosmos, the Space Agency of the Russian Federation.
Gekot travelled on the Foton-M4 satellite for more than a month and a half.
The satellite returned to Earth on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the test.
Even though the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
The effects on the Geckos can be used to predict the effects that weightlessness would have on a person while he was staying for longer periods of time in a similar state, illustrated New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or causes of death of the geckos are determined.
According to Interfax, passengers crossed into sex bugs were frozen.
The surprise is also that the fruit flies travelling on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip without difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter for a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities announced this on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track him down after he had used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man's actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people attracted to the war in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that about 800 French nationals or those enrolled in France have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The wishes of the basketball national team for a sequel are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine today in its second match of the World Cup.
If the opening loss to the United States had been expected, Ukraine is one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Peter Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match of the Games.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Eugene-Pooh — Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we’ve played against them before and we need to get our standard defense fixed,” Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than yesterday in its defeat to the United States.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal pack of wolves in the field,” Möttölä said.
Hollywood star's alleged nude images spread online - some confirmed to be genuine
A number of nude images are being posted on the Internet, allegedly portraying well-known public figures.
Actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a nude campaign.
The entertainment site TMZ has released an angry comment given by Lawrence representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant breach of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images she is spreading are genuine.
She had taken these pictures with her husband years ago.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a gruesome effort was made for this.
I have compassion for everyone who was a victim of hacking, he writes according to the site.
Victoria Justice, on the other hand, calls the images under her own name \"false\".
Genuine or fake nude images are also on the move from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: “They don’t work hard enough to get out of here.”
Football club FC Honka is currently in the final place of the Veikkausliiga.
The comments made by goalkeeper Walter Viitala after Sunday's VPS match well reflect the club's confused current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper in four months.
But everything has to be adapted - Viitala said after the 1-2 defeat ended after the struggle.
Honka made a lot of defensive head mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the poor defensive play.
Player traffic in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, which is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With player roulette, many young players have also had opportunities that they might not even deserve.
“Some of us don’t work hard enough to get out of here sometimes, and Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
“After the game, I told certain players that if you come to training and games to have fun and you think you’re a betting league player and don’t have to work, you’re probably on the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success as gamemates constantly change.
This season has not had the same lineup twice in a row.
Especially in the defenses, people have changed.
That’s the biggest reason we’re in this position,” Kuqi said.
After a VPS loss, Honka is a serial jumbo, at even points with the second last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the betting league, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to Number One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop one now.
We’re definitely not going to fall out of this series — the goalkeeper Viitala.
Lars von Trier is making a TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return to filmmaking.
The Danish director is preparing a television series called The House That Jack Built.
The series project was reported by Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films today at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to a statement from Zentropa, the series should begin filming in 2016.
Trier is reported to be focusing on the scriptwork of the series as of this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also reported by Trier’s long-time collaborator Peter Aalbæk Jensen, a producer known for his hard sales speeches.
According to him, a similar series - has never been seen or will ever be seen - has never been seen.
Hold your breath, Aalbæk Jensen said in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac in recent years.
For television, he directed the Kingdom series in the 1990s.
01.09.2014 15:20 The store chain Lidl seems to have got the Finns on its side, at least if you believe in the results.
Lidl Suomi Kommandiiteyhdistys Group, which runs the operations of Lidl Finland, continued to grow in the financial year ending at the end of February.
The company also increased its earnings.
Profit before taxes reached EUR 79.6 million, compared to EUR 56.4 million one year earlier.
Sales increased from EUR 960 million to EUR 1.2 billion.
The increase was 25%.
The company, which increased its market share, also improved its operating profit from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The operating profit percentage was 7.1.
The German-owned Lidl’s financial year will run from the beginning of March until the end of February.
The company says that it paid EUR 13.7 million in tax to Finland for the financial year ending in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its chain of stores, has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and it employs more than 4,000 employees.
The first stores opened in 2002.
Ice Bucket
British Isabelle Roberts roared so loud when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment for her caricature while performing the Ice Bucket challenge so fast that her jawbone dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so loud when ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I was just roaring, but as I roared, I felt my jaw getting stiffer,” he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and started laughing, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old British, who participated in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
The video clip has become an Internet sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Point of view on wolf howling: How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
Today was a great day.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played against France in the European Championship final at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
He wasn't exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the hundred Finns who shouted the noise of 20,000 spectators in an otherwise empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match in Finland-Ukraine?
There are eighty times more troops of 100 Finnish fans in Bilbao.
The 1995 European Championship was a time for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, for example, in the Russian qualifying match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to European cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, such as Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä with lime lines to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed about.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, although not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, a little more than 100 Finns were reportedly present.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, too, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can tell you the exact number of Finnish tourists.
Estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10,000.
No matter what the number is, it’s an incomprehensible number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In a global global economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, there is still a chance to see how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go and see how our girls and boys succeed in the world,” says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
Certainly, both in Spain and at the World Volleyball Championships in Poland, there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
Sports themselves need to be attractive.
Itkonen makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses cannot move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team activities were raised to the pedestal.
Volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred Trinity works: sports media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught what this carnivalistic support is, Itkonen reminds us.
Can the ball sports transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played for an average of hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen considers the question a good one and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good species.
The second school believes that interest is shifting.
The other one is the one who doesn't want to have a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experiential trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic shows are not of dual interest.
It is a challenge for the people in the midst of the drug.
Bottas plot secure - almost 1.5 hectares from lake shore
Nastola rewards Formula Driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach home plot.
The municipal government approved the transfer of a plot of 1.4 hectares at its meeting unanimously on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be added to the property.
Nastola has followed the success of Bottas since his karting days.
He is perceived as a good ambassador to market Lahte, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven demolition buildings in the area, six of which will be demolished by the end of this year.
Bottas reached Formula 1 in the Belgian race for his fourth prize baller this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived in Vilhunt during his childhood.
He currently lives in England but visits Nastola every time he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design clothes come, but hardly for the poor.
It is currently presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open Tennis Competition in New York City.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by ball players on the field, but also by the top amateur Marcus Giron of college players.
According to him, the shirt helps him to follow his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the nylon shirt, from which information is transmitted to the mokkula on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
The central unit is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given an exact time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even hinted at its price, Tech Times reports.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in smart clothes.
Californian Athos has brought a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing, and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 apiece and a thumb-sized central unit that they require costs $2,100.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technovates.
A smart way to save money on textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is about to start his second year of study, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which later-year students borrow their books for a nominal fee rather than selling the books immediately.
“My mathematics book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the entire semester, plus a big sandwich,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder reports that his books for the last semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120.
According to the University Board of Trustees, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
An increasing number of students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay clearly less for it than the students buying the book.
According to more than 250 campus bookstore Neebo Inc companies, renting textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores this spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online Shops
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained for a third of the price it would cost in a campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler’s-Calculus book is almost $290, but from the online store of special books, Chegg.com, the book gets $239.99.
Buy used
Used books are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the “Calculus” book can be used at the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's final year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought a book — Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business — used on Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey and other academics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls School recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
At times, the reform of the new edition is not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
You should consider renting textbooks if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a “Calculus” book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Check out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use and wear of the highlighter pen.
Renter, be careful: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Obtaining e-books instead of regular papers can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented out, paying the owner of an e-book, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store gets the book “Calculus” as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors is worthwhile, whichever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends taking advantage of the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it will help to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price from the university bookstore.

Almost double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Almost twice as many people have died in fires this year compared to last year.
According to media surveillance by the Finnish Emergency Services Association (Spek), 55 people have been killed in fires in 49 different fires.
Last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
The majority of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age.
According to the organisation's fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
17 fire deaths have occurred in apartment buildings, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spek reminds me of the fire safety of the home.
At least all home fire alarms should be checked.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing devices are easy to put into use.
There must also be an unobstructed exit route from all the premises of the home.
Children should also be told which electrical devices they can use while at home alone.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for the anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for the so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people rescued by air from Blue Mountains in Australia
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after a night stuck in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man set out to hike on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The family worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party consisting of local police and helpers was sent to find the young, and the duo were found at about 23:00 near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple and were taken to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from the Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given a retreat order.
According to Ukraine, paratroopers have been vehemently clashing with Russian tanks in the field.
According to the military spokesman, the gunfire on the opposing side has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
In the Asova Sea off southeastern Ukraine, a Ukrainian patrol ship that received artillery hits yesterday sank in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no idea where the ship was shot.
The separatists said on social media yesterday that they had shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, insisted that Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw from positions from which they cannot fire civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, talks in Minsk today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should result in an immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused floods in Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains whipped southern Sweden and Denmark.
Flood waters cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars under them.
On Sunday, authorities estimate that it may take some time for the flood to subside, even though the rains were predicted to stop on Monday.
The heavy rains were able to surprise the Swedish authorities, and no weather warning was given in advance about the rains.
Ari Mustala, an on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that plagued the area was very local.
The rainforest looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
French socialists should remain silent and help France, Francois Hollande's main supporter says
Valls called on the deeply divided left — to show its feelings — against the socialist president with difficulties, whose composition of the new government failed to obtain the approval of the majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our job is to stay with him — Valls said and deserved applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave alone the controversial 35-hour working week of France, despite the proposal made earlier this week by the new finance minister Emmanuel Macron that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to work together with the government.
However, Minister of Justice Christiane Taubira caused dissension by appearing at a meeting of Socialist MPs who expressed dissent and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing France to give up hope for the future.
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the continued discord among socialists and said that he does not believe that the new government of Valls will last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone calling the war, but so has Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
“And the new government won’t last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to disband the parliament and considered sure his party's election victory in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the top of the list in the May EU elections.
According to a poll published in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split up into several competing groups before the end of the Hollande season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, political researcher at Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public needs to notice quickly that the change is happening,” he said.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Pokka cheated Good morning The boss of Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-moira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda was badly betrayed in the recorded part of the program.
The Good Morning Finland programme released a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Jorta and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Good Morning from the next day’s broadcast, but the recording does not go quite in the pipeline.
Alm-Siira goes crazy in his words when he tries to pronounce the word in a budget run, and his confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their heads time and again.
And these heroes should be allowed to stream live again tomorrow, says the Finnish news release.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo agency for the magazine picture, finished third in a series of portraits in 1972.
This is Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in Fredrikinkatu, Helsinki, in May 1971.
There were many heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were enormous.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had about five minutes to shoot.
I took this picture from five feet away.
The light and the background were right.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
It is clear from Meir's face that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
The competition then managed with pictures of known people or events.
It’s great that you can succeed with other images now, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation has already cost over EUR 5 million
Investigating the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 person-years of work.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his doctoral thesis on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the enforcement of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to solve the crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be reviewed on Saturday.
The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: “Fish and chicken dishes included in the plant diet”
A picture of a special press release on the wall of the Pirkkala Women’s Journey School caused a food stand on social media, says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Vegetarian lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when there is meat on the list will we make a vegetarian alternative!
This is what is said on the school wall in a 15-year-old bulletin.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send angry feedback to the Pirkkala municipality.
Arja Vaarma, head of food and cleanliness services, tells Yle that the note that has been forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there was a thought like this that was discussed with health care at the time.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian alternative only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or nurse about the vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution for Yle by the fact that the young people’s vegetarian food experiments may leave food deficient and the lack of meat or chicken may raise wonders from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise near $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion. The data comes from people closely involved in the matter.
The acquisition would allow Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of $6.8 billion, to have access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information on a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be public because negotiations were not conducted in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises representatives did not respond to comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
The company Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales amounted to USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, also operating from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The cruise industry worth $29 billion is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of emerging economies such as China and India.
The companies compete to become the number one option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded with its current line-up in 2000 after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the published information, Genting’s share of the company was 28 percent, Apollo’s 20 percent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP’s share was 8 percent from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise have a combined share of 82% of the cruise capacity in North America, according to a registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issue of shares.
The City Council of Tampere will discuss the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the City Government will provide strong support for the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, who is preparing a doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, the time of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that the keeping of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be applied to Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of Näsi dolphin strengthens the demands for the closure of dolphinarium activities.
The death of Särkänniemi is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi Dolphinarium.
It’s time to put a stop to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start exploring how to transfer the Tampere dolphins to a restricted sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Your nose did not have time to return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience even more life than the unsettled concrete basin, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Protection Association aims to prohibit the use of all wildlife species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Protection Act under preparation.
This includes dolphins.
In support of the demand, Animalia’s Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in the demonstration on behalf of the dolphins on 1 September.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are brutally captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphinariums or for food.
Putin urges Kiev to open talks with Ukraine on a new state
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern parts of the country and to immediately start negotiations on a different territory -- statehood -- Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government for talks with Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners matches his apparent strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help the separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to practically grant Novorossija independence, which allows it to direct Russia to the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army's efforts to take back the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which was taken by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula to itself on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently baptised the region into a Novorossija . . . a new Russia . . . this term resembles the days of glory that preceded the revolutions of the Russian great power.
According to Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks are an illusion as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26, and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
“We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state in south-eastern Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there,” he said.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to statehood is related to broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the Kiev leadership in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a conflict within Ukraine.
The Kremlin spokesman's interim remark aimed at correcting Putin's comments - the wrong interpretation - stressed that the Russian regime dealt with the separatist revolt in the eastern regions differently than in Crimea, when it practically took over an area with a majority of 2 million people ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to integrate the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population supported staying in Ukraine.
Independence, discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually power in the region that connects Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, is home to the main Russian fleet, as well as commercial shipping port areas and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the region between Rostov and Crimea, which produce products of vital importance to the Russian army.
In his inaugural address on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of Ukraine's non-core regions over their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and instigated by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest request to the Kiev government for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the takeover of the separatist city of Novoazovsky, supported by Russia, is the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area of Crimea.
It has led to a massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Mariupol, with half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsky and a narrow area of land leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in Brussels to the leaders of the European Union, asking for further measures to prevent future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon reach a point where there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders called for further sanctions to be put in place if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russia in Ilovaisk were replaced by 10 Russian parachutists, who were captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Japanese genius Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari and a little later Jeremy Menez were hit by a penalty kick.
Lazio also received a penalty at the end of the game after his narrowing goal, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this season from Real Madrid.
In Milan's former aggressor icon Inzagh's coaching debut San Siro Stadium was only half full.
A total of 39,000 spectators were announced as the audience for the match.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in a nude scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged by hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
The entertainment world has been buzzing since a bunch of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were released on the internet as a result of a widespread celebrity image hacking scandal.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude images of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, such as supermodel Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Images of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko, who live in Melbourne, have also apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential, \"This is disgusting.
All personal communication and images should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
Greckon in New York reportedly commented on the incident in an online newspaper — shameful — and said that the victims — feel ashamed —
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer on topless edge of the pool.
Palmer's film merits include film “Love and Honor” with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokeswoman told TMZ that there was an insolent breach of privacy.
Actor Seth Rogen was angry at the hacker in his tweet: “The release of images stolen from a cell phone is in no way different from the sale of a stolen product”
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view.
Finland played almost like its home field and rose to a sensational victory over Cuba at the World Volleyball Championship.
Look at the pictures of the fan.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white, but Finnish blue and white.
According to STT, nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters followed Finland's victory in the Spodek Arena.
It was like playing at home.
The fans had such a big impact on our game,” Finland’s captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost 0-2 in the match, but rose to 3-2 in the win.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle climb from behind six points.
Cuba already led the round 16-10, but after that, the Finns were charmed.
However, a couple of hundred Finnish fans were disappointed when a charter plane was unable to land in Katowice due to the heavy fog.
So the fans who ended up in Warsaw were late for the match.
Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a high rate in recent days.
In Bilbao, Spain, more than 8,000 Finnish fans will be present at the World Basketball Championships.
It was as if every basket in Finland had been a winning basket for the match, U.S. star player Stephen Curry praised Finnish basketball fans after Saturday's match.
