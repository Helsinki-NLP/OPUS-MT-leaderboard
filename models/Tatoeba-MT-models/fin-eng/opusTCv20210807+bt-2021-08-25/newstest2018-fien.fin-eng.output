Camille Auer wanted to fix her gender, diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's making art on the subject -- a person should have the right to his own body --
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the ceiling of the Academy of Fine Arts’ Project room gallery.
Each of them says the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell a long story about how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decide for him who he is.
“I wanted to tell you about my personal treatment history in order to make the violence in the process visible,” Auer says.
By the process, he refers to the process of gender correction.
It is often a years-long period of research that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process starts with a referral to diagnostic studies on gender identity disorder, which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he ordered over the internet and was already well into his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to legally correct the gender.
The Transgender Act, or the Act on the Strengthening of the Sex of Transsek Sual (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to get the right gender, for example, into the Population Register Centre and passport.
At the moment, each person who corrects their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and proof of infertility.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
“This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,” Auer said.
The reform of the Transla Act has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has made eight comments on the law and there is a preliminary ruling in the European Court of Justice that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change to the Act under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
The elections came and the Finns Party came to the government.
The law change is now stuck again.
It is a matter of internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government doesn’t want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the board about changing the law,” says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty’s Finnish branch.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the Patient Report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer, a psychologist at Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote a story that would define Auer's right to care for and to receive help.
The consciousness of the studied reality appears to be subject to wavering.
The student’s perception of self appears to be fragmented in a borderline way and the unstable traits associated with personality are emphasized.
Auer didn't recognize himself from these descriptions.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,” Auer said.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given sex-repair treatment.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked off the television in the waiting lobby of the transpoli.
Later that television produced a work of art called Monument for the Excluded, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that anyone who is defined as a woman at birth can magnify their breasts, but a diagnosis is needed to remove their breasts,” Auer said.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything but the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only one of its kind.
The gender correction process is harder for many people for mental reasons than purely because of medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to be justified by their own existence and their right to have their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people in need of support and help are denied treatment, arguing that their resources aren’t enough,” Auer said.
Many people who seek the process have mental symptoms: depression, anxiety, potential bullying experiences.
On this basis, medical staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
“Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process started,” Auer said.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: “I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that’s what people usually find difficult to digest.
The depression has been treated with medication and when Auer started using hormones, it became easier.
He had finally been able to express the feelings that had existed since childhood and in his teens.
Why the broad jaw did not seem to fit into your body and why your chest muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
Seeing is a basic need.
“You have to justify yourself with so much talk, dress, use of voice and movements,” she says.
Today, Auer feels that he is already seen, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, the casual comments of the loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people are wrong.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they won’t or won’t be able to internalize it,” he said.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or parts of the body can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no formal confirmation of one’s gender.
“There is no medical basis for these studies,” Auer said.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to legal gender.
An adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating that he/she feels that he/she is of another gender.
After six months of reflection, the applicant confirms his/her application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right to self-determination is also required in Finland, and this demand is also crystallized in Auer’s exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

Civil Rights Organization issued travel warning to Missouri
Afro-American civil rights organization, NAACP, has issued a travel warning for Missouri due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
“NAACP’s travel bulletin on Missouri comes into force on 28 August 2017 and urges African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and exercise extreme caution while travelling to a state where there have recently been numerous questionable racial-based events,” the statement said.
The law that recently came into force in Missouri makes it difficult to export discrimination cases to court, and the enforcement of state laws disproportionately targets minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
The civil rights of people are violated.
They are stopped based on skin color and beaten or killed — Rod Chapel, president of NAACP Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
We've never heard of so many cases in so short a time.
The Missouri Travel Bulletin is the organization's first warning to the state of the United States.
For example, the organization cited racist comments against African American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year, he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by Missouri Police, although he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to the Missouri Attorney General's report that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
“The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends, and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay bail or by telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015 a hundred hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, the sixteenth most in the U.S. states.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it difficult to sue companies for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had passed immigration laws requiring the police to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the organization, increases racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and concern other states. However, recently, non-governmental organizations have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the CEO’s supplementary pension
Mika Lintilä, the Minister of Economic Affairs responsible for state ownership steering, has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension payment received by the airline’s CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
It is contrary to the state's will.
The EUR 130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo came up this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
Finland’s Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s decision-in-principle on ownership management.
The sanctions immediately escalated the speech.
Until recently, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
At the G20 summit in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along well with each other.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump were bitterly reacted to in Russia.
The most stunning response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who says that the sanctions bill signed by Trump means a full-scale trade war.
Even if Russian reactions only signify political rhetoric as exacerbations and excesses, the tightening of the U.S.-Russia relationship is a fact after a brief honeymoon after Trump's choice.
In the United States, the passage of sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
The Congress passed the law with considerable unanimity, but the president said it was much more difficult to pass the law.
Trump has recently criticized the law he has signed as “significantly inadequate.”
President Trump’s gluttony may have been due especially to Russia, although the adoption of a law restricting own powers must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, an investigation is being conducted in the United States about Russia’s possible interference in the presidential election as well as Trump’s campaign links with Russia.
The tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a brief honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed rapidly and various scandalous twists have been revealed almost to be updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not made in the United States under the leadership of the President but in spite of the President.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is kimurant in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea is tightening relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a country that has a lot of trade with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent U.S. sanctions are still unclear.
The EU has feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas, which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than useful.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House is now looking for a Statue of Liberty
To intervene in statues is the surest sign of a change in power.
The Americans know it as well as anyone else: the Iraqis, along with American soldiers, took down the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the chief ideologists in the Trump administration, well knew what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a word bar, regarding the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticize the statue itself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruise organizers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The object of his attack was the significance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue's pedestal — 17 years after the statue was completed.
I saw Miller squealing Acosta: “I don’t want to go further into its history now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty -
Miller wasn’t wrong, but it’s not just about history, as he said.
Lazarus’s touching words are the only ones of their kind in which the state calls not only immigrants but — the poorest of the poor —: Your Tired, Your Poor, / Your Huddled Masses yearning to create free, / The Wretched Refuse of Your Teeming Shore —
The poem is now more current than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, and he made it clear that the “poorest of the poor” are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal. They well knew that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to embody the links between French and American republicanism with a classic symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Attaching the poem to the image was an ingenious feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to turn it back into the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a mouthpiece who can now be regarded as some sort of predictor of Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives, who takes the United States torch to a world covered by darkness: “Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States.
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the ship's deck after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people seeking protection and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
And that's not what Miller and Trump want.
Their torches do not show the way, but stir up the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots entered the UK national team
Neil Black, Executive Vice President of the UK Athletics Federation, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Championships are — a significant confirmation —
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is something special going on in Scotland that UK athletics must learn from.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what is going on,” Black said.
“I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the Institute’s activities.
The Scottish Athletics Association, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the activities of the Association,
And the British Athletics Association believes that their activities are behind it.
And the average streetman thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it's something wonderful, whatever it is.
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who compete with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre run, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as captain of the national team.
Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was incredible -- Black says.
“Sportsmen left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happened to live and practice.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports -
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist for the Commonwealth Championships in the 400-metre fence race, and these are his fifth World Cup, and he thinks it’s “unbelievable” that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
Mid-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records over the year.
He competes in London for 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London. Also worth keeping an eye on: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings at the UK World Cup Qualifiers and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman in the national team besides him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is -- immensely proud -- that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final seats and medals.
“It’s a great honor to be captain, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“Of course I’m very proud of all the Scots who made it to the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They participate as distinguished athletes who compete for prize winners.
Captain's speech?
I thought it went well.
I was focused on how lucky we are to have a home run.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere is going to be amazing.
Blocking reviewers on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics ranging from his political principles.
Criticism must have been annoying.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led as dumb and silent as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
That brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their authors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge unjustified, and his attitude was downplaying also online.
It's just Facebook, a lot of people are commenting.
But it matters,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the Democratic-controlled state.
He has received second-best estimates of his actions among 50 governors.
Hogan is not sensitive to hot dogs.
He has led the state firmly and strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and published a picture of a balded head in chemotherapy there.
Therefore, blocking users entering the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum, which is maintained by his staff with tax funds.
Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, who said it was just a question of moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and relevant.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Maryland's Bowie was not hostile but posed a question about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news — he wrote in comments to the Washington Post news.
“I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately regarded as an organized group and are ignored as a large group of concerned citizens.
The governor's staff called comments -- a focused attack -- someone else might call them to promote things considered important.
In the Facebook era, communication can be easily managed by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials published, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It’s the same thing, digitally only.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of shackling Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision was made last week in Virginia.
According to Alexandria District Court judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County government violated the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution while blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association went to discuss with Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about Twitter and Facebook usage.
This shouldn't be difficult.
In Washington’s time, low-cost postage had a similar effect as the Internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers hammered Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers in which they barked at Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the United States-British Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, and also online notifications from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from southern and southwestern Finland, but then also from individual Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died of a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to hit pigeons, and especially from them to the pigeon.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also observed in finches.
In 2009 it was really good.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a big collapse in Finland’s green finch stock, after which the strains of the species have been recovering.
There have now been sick green finches, but at least not yet on a large scale,” says Juha Honkala, museum master at the University of Helsinki’s Central Museum of Natural History (Luomus).
The fear is that the previous epidemic of green finches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop summer feeding birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field representation at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field representation for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led a tournament held at the Archerfield Links field next door last year before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of a new location and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory,” Rafferty said.
Players can see the field at its best. It is in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador for the game, and he is proud of his achievements here.
This tournament is a great show on this field.
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won both a European tour and a European challenger tour in his 32-year career.
“This seems like a very special occasion,” a Southport player said.
“I didn’t get to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember.
Gary Orr returns to the real world on his own soil, and he went on tour after he turned 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I am pleased with my game so far.
The trio is accompanied by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Parking for a car costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.

Possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
In Säkylä, at least so far, no indoor air problems have been found in the message company building of the Pori Brigade, the brigade reported Thursday.
Indoor air research is still ongoing.
The investigations began when a man who interrupted his conscript service for health reasons thought his health weakened due to the poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lieutenant Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been observed in the health situation of the other conscripts.
It turns out that this was an isolated case, and there have been no health problems with the other people who served in that unit.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any indoor air problems,” Holma says.
The brigade's statement says that due to the arrival of the July batch, goods had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused the dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stale as a result, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Gold Country
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove for cooking.
He rarely uses a pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato — locally —nota — directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the sweet potato burned on the carrion is eaten grumblingly with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as washing laundry in cloudy water fetched from a nearby swamp.
The toilet office is supplied by a bucket in a roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and has not been assigned fields to care for.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and soldiers must also be taken into account.
“No one dares to walk in the village after 5 p.m.,” Degei said.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum, in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch power, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which strictly controls the region and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is remote and turbulent. The journey starts with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues on a stomach-wrenching five-hour drive with a rental car.
There's no public transportation here.
The town of about 19,000 people has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated roofs have been dyed yellowish brown by rust.
Few Indonesians have been here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago tribes worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
“We didn’t have any clothes like this,” Degei says. He means a colorful hand woven wrap hat, a dark skirt and a bright-colored blouse.
We used to only have magazines covered in our bodies.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold country of Indonesia.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. Only about a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix, United States.
In 2015, the mine generated $3.1 billion in gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in wood reserves.
For the Papuans, however, these riches bring misery because they mean the suffocating presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and military local units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paid as much as $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income and are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500,000 people and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s gained proportions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area in peaceful protests.
Brisbane Archdiocese's 2016 report We Will Lose Everything reports on previous year's atrocities, such as executions without trial, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular means - and relentless attacks on peaceful protests.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because there are cases every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 percent are Christians, but the demographic structure is changing as Indonesian populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi migrate to the region in search of a better livelihood.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado-hate essence in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market place cheaper than locals,” says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Paniai and moved to the provincial capital after work.
Local women lost their clients.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Yokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address Papua's injustices and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 areas, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 areas, including Paniai, on his way to the Jakarta Presidential Palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” you said.
Paniai experienced some kind of wavebase just two months after Yokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared from the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should wear headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the accounts of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers took the children and assaulted them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Election Commission, located near the scene, was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand people, including young men and women and children, gathered in front of a local police station and an army command centre in the football field to demand justice.
They had hunting bows for feasts, and they began to perform the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago tribe, dancing in the ring and emulating the bird song.
Some protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere heated, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: “If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them to death — The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine that has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, a resident leader of the Kego Koto region, suspected the situation would get out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
“When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist — he told TIME magazine in bright color on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
A number of shootings were fired.
Alfius Youwi was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
“I ran to him and made sure it was really him,” Yohanes told TIME. Like many Indonesians, he only uses one name.
I saw that he was dead... and I kissed him...
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were just protecting the police station because it was under attack.
\"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,\" Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
It's about life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killing was sent to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Yokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
I want the case investigated immediately so that it never happens again.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations of human rights violations outside the legal system.
He immediately began to withdraw his speech.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but certain processes are needed to do so — he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
Everything will be settled in court, he said.
The United Nations accuses Wiranto of crimes against humanity — Crimes are linked to the death of more than 1,000 people in a bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai have a bleak disbelief in their claims.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” Yohanes said.
I'm tired of this.
He says he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
I am afraid, he says.
I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panic people are afraid to discuss the event.
He says the soldiers had abused him after helping bury four of the victims.
“Soldiers will find me in their hands after the victims are buried,” he said.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot down villagers in the neighboring area of Paniai in Deiyai.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the manager refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital, including children.
The man in need of hospital care was Ravianus Douw, 24, who had been hit by water while fishing on a nearby river, and died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
According to locals, however, the mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, causing one villager to be killed.
“We are terrified, afraid of revenge,” said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought to treatment.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and the mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes that live in the lush middlelands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents who claim to defend the rights of the parrots by random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai, in the name of safeguarding national sovereignty.
Some of the detainees will never return.
Among the Beans, Paniai is known as a “sad, forgotten place”
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and it is also too expensive for locals,
Just like bread.
People grow their food themselves: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold in the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to better-educated and more wealthy immigrants than locals.
Only a few beaners have sufficient capital and expertise to run their own company in a competitive manner.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, president of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Outlying Papua is a little out of focus in the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain stringent.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare filming license. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia’s Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Yokowi has not kept his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor contributed to development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
\"Indonesian journalists reporting on the troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua have new risks: visa denial and blacklisting,\" Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is under pressure only from nearby neighbors in Papua.
In March, six Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s numerous and widespread violations — including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so hiding the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult.”
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When a Dutch official delegation led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, a source who attended the meeting said.
Indonesia has a presidential election in 2019, but the beans say they are no longer likely to vote for Yokowi.
“Jokowi means well, but there are people around him who are involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the Panic: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in lack and poverty, practically without health services and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, Panics, like other beans, consider the votes they give to Yokowi to be a debt that must be repaid.
They don't want money, they just want justice, he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again showed resistance symbolically: they buried one of the victims in the opposite land of the police station and army headquarters.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
My family member was killed, Yacobus says.
What else could we do?
Dereck Chisora calls for Robert Helenius' rematch to be cancelled: \"Even their own fans don't want to see --
The heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight in the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
The match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in a recent interview with IFL TV, throws the cause of the rematch completely on Helenius' shoulders.
My fight in Finland flopped, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
It was my opponent’s fault.
Even his fans don’t want to see him fight because he sucks.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial scoring award.
The re-match ticket sales went smoothly, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been moved to autumn.
Nothing new has been heard from the match since then.
However, the cancellation no longer bothers Chisora.
The match would probably have been cancelled after Chisora had fallen ill.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up in a lot of pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be operated on, Chisora said.
The UK says it is currently in about 45 percent condition.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a defeat for Whyte in December with discord.
Fire took over Torch skyscraper in Dubai for the second time
The flames captured one of the world’s highest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee from a 337-metre-high 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in a building called Torch, a torch.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to have been injured, and the cause of the fire was unknown immediately after the incident.
“We were sleeping and we woke up with a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes — a resident named George told Reuters.
According to Dubai rescue officials, fire extinguishing forces were able to extinguish the fire at four in the morning at local time and stayed to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise further questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surfaces of high-rise buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building board commissioned a study that found that the boards used for cladding and insulation of the facade suffered the most damage.
In the UK, police believe that the Grenfell Tower insulation and cladding plates in London could contribute to the rapid advance of flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
The Mopo was Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
Mopo was found later Thursday.
The police request observations of the moped or its capture by email to This email address is being protected from spambots.

Modified on August 3, 2017 at 12:40 p.m.: Police announced that a moped had been found.
More than 20 percent of air passengers in the United States take on board prohibited items, according to a survey.
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unwittingly taken prohibited items onto aircraft past the checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA). At least six percent of passengers had knives or other bladed items that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% said they only found out afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey was conducted by more than 1,000 passengers and was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, and the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
19.7% of passengers knowingly violating the TSA rules were from Generation Y and less than 15% belonged to Generation X.
The most common rule was broken by bringing food and fluids to the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly exporting blade-mounted items to the aircraft, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men reported knowingly exporting prohibited drugs to the aircraft.
Passengers from all over the United States took part in the survey. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many smuggled goods had accidentally passed security checks and how many had done so consciously.
Not surprisingly, most travelers are also most likely to take smuggled goods past security — knowingly or unwittingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey states, TSA guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what fluids to take on the plane and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also the belief that books should not be taken to the aircraft.
Fluids can be exported to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said his decision to delay Obama’s decision to reduce emissions.
A day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions made during the Obama administration to reduce smog-causing emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he is running takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt did not mention in a word the action brought against his earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeals.
The states should start to comply with the ground-level ozone requirements for 2015 as of 1 October.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year to give his agency more time to familiarise itself with the plan, because the agency - does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth -
Pruitt was a public prosecutor for the state of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical industry and the fossil-fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden change of mind is the latest setback to Pruitt’s plan to mitigate the regulations.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington issued a ruling that the EPA director overstepped his mandate in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration’s decision on oil and gas companies, which ordered the companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his turn to the ozone regulations only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
“During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to sue it for reaching an agreement on schedules,” Pruitt said.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers it confers on us.
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt can continue to exercise its powers to delay the execution of decisions and other legal powers to ensure that the provisions are justified and based on the best available information.
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in the ozone regulations in Congress.
The aim of the bill passed last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the EPA's coalition that sued this week, said the group plans to continue the pressure.
“The EPA’s change of mind as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitised groups of people, and is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
“It’s worrying how much pressure was required to make sense of the guy in charge of our breathing air,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration, as its ideological objective is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups pursuing their own interests.
A SUV coming from a supercar manufacturer takes place in the style of a Ferrari.
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer introduces its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All cases of Eastern Savo measles of the same type of virus
The measles infection in the coastal Strait is the same type of virus as in previous cases in Eastern Savo, reports THL.
The Virology Laboratory of the National Institute for Health and Welfare has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo’s fifth measles infection is the same strain of the virus as previous infections.
THL has ensured that the measles infection confirmed on Friday, July 28, by a person in the coastal straitline is the same type of virus as the previous cases in Eastern Savo.
Based on this information, all infections found in Eastern Savo relate to the first measles outbreak in the region in June.
The news is good because it means that we have not come up with any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may still appear between mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Dr Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for the primary health care of Soster.
There have been no new measles infections or suspicions since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their vaccination protection is up-to-date, says Erkkilä.

Finland prepares for the lawful act of screaming
The pantika soup was not even considered legalized.
On the background of the argument that the process produces, along with liquor, methanol, which is toxic.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing a moonshine soup is not even considered.
The shield is made by fermentation, the moon is distilled again.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that in addition to liquor, the process produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to enact a pontika soup as a right of every man, says Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared a reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of the Pontika was not considered legalized.
It was not brought to the political table either.
There was no discussion on the liberalisation of distillation, MP Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) says.
He is in the negotiating group of parliamentary groups in the government parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
In the future, even on application, you will not be able to authorise the distillation of the moon in the home.
Commercial production is also subject to authorisation.
According to Tuominen, there is a simple rule for the home preparation of alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be produced by fermentation at home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make screams at home.
The government wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavour and aroma substances and enables the production of screams, Mäkelä refines.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or the flavours and flavourings produced during their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, drinks can be made as much as they want, and self-made alcohol can be given as a gift.
It is not allowed to be sold.
Kilju’s work is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The Alcohol Act is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be discussed by Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The session is 5 September.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius escorted to hospital by armed guards
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pain, was rushed to a South African hospital for suspected heart attacks.
Pistorius has already left the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to the hospital this morning, escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesperson confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for an investigation.
A spokesperson for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literated phone calls reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The transcriptions of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on 27 January 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop public speaking about not paying for the proposed border wall.
The US president accused Nieto of having knocked out the wall project in public. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcription of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the United States would take on refugees on their way to Australia must “be ridiculous” and “stupid” Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama’s term would make him look like an idiot because he had proposed a ban on the colonization of refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant phone call of the whole day”
Georgia massacre: Activists set up again for racist lynching in hope of justice
A Ford Mercury-branded car passes a crowd in Monroe's small town of Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man dressed in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and looks through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
Roger, N--U-- the man's coughing.
Get out of the car.
Screams break the silence when a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a restage that was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are real when the noose is rolled around the neck of —Roger.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to restage the 1946 events. At that time, Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years — even though the murderers are living among us and many need to know who they are — says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in rearrangement of the set-up.
It's a shame stain in history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our soul.
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the restage is a startling invitation to action, and it also reminds Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want the perpetrators to be tried. We want things to be finally finished, and we want to recover from grief and reconcile, but above all we want justice,” Brooks said.
We can't recover and make peace until we get justice.
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to FBI documents received by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
No one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives of lynching have been known to locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, blacks in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in the presidential election by the Supreme Court in April, and elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, an incident occurred around the time of the election in which black tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently concerned Malcom's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the city was rumored that Hester had had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting her child.
According to FBI records, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcom's $600 bail against which he was released from prison on July 25, 1946.
On the way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
“It turns out Harrison ordered and arranged the murders,” the FBI report said.
It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, who were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Witnesses.
Brooks says it more succinctly.
It was a voter murder, he said.
They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote.
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reconstruction of the Georgian massacre for almost a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating, a depiction of a shocking racism that many would like to believe has already disappeared from the present-day United States.
It’s hard to watch the show, but even harder not to see what Greene says is meant to be.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we have to face our own dark side,” the director said.
“But I can’t create a relationship with you if you can’t hear me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.
The rehearsals for this year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been portraying the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan for years at the stage, but the role is always as difficult and repulsive.
“I feel dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh said.
It is important, however, that this side of history is also displayed so that it never happens again.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and pushes Hester, and he's furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
Didn't you hear me?
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then there's the punch.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs the hardest.
Rascona's asking.
He's confused.
Did I accidentally find it too fast? he asked.
- No, Greene's not.
I just don't think white people used the word \"n--u\" at the time.
The other black actor confirmed.
- It's slang.
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is dominated by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those killed.
The scene starts from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are breaking.
Nobody laughs.
The relocation ends quickly and violently.
Screams, shots, and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit song.
His voice is broken with every other word.
A few hundred feet away, fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Almost half of the audience are black and half are white.
Among them are a couple who have come to see a show from Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in Georgia's pressing humidity.
The murders have turned from a story to a reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the song, Greene invites the crowd to check the bodies.
Children squat to look at artificial blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
“They’re not really dead, the little boy mutters like reminding himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who performed lynchers take off their cloaks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a hard performance.
Don't worry, the woman in the show is comforting.
We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.
Later, the audience and actors gather for a dinner.
A white couple from Altanta are discussing the show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the sensations that the performance evokes.
“It’s hard to listen to horrible words and watch horrible things that are said and done by people who look like you, just because they look like you,” he said.
“I was made to realize that lynchings are still happening — he added. —They’re just called arrests —
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning next year's show.
“Resurrection is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also an educational experience,” Brooks said.
The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it...
Shrinking vegetables in stores sparks: Removing this much -- extra parts -- actually saves you
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of cauliflower already in the store before weighing?
How about taking off a large hat piece of pineapple - no matter how much weight it weighs?
The answers strongly share opinions: for one, it is an expression of extreme snooze, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that are not used and yet go to the trash at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in the shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket in Ruoholahti, Helsinki, because many people tear off the leaf parts of the cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the biowaste in the store.
According to the news published by the Financial Messages, snooping at the vegetable counter surprises traders.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing actually save you money?
How important is this really?
We women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, mushrooms, broccoli and cauliflower take the leaves or strains off.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower costing EUR 2.10 was EUR 1.80 when all the leaves were peeled out of it.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple, which costs EUR 2.30, dropped to EUR 1.95 when its stock turned away.
Globe artichoke: The price of EUR 2.60 was EUR 2.40 when the short position was cut off.
Delicious mushrooms: Two mushrooms cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the stock, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without carrying 80 cents.
The result: If leaves and strains start picking off, save a few dozen cents at best for one vegetable.
In percentage terms, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 per cent.
This would have saved a total of 1.20 euros!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - Brazil star signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football club PSG, according to the news agency AFP.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a buy-out price of €222 million to FC Barcelona, a football league player.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League blocked the transfer earlier Thursday when it rejected Neymar's representatives' first payment attempt.
According to the league rules, the purchasing club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out his contract himself, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who provided the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He may be introduced to a new home audience in the PSG season's opening against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA investigates the details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association UEFA so that it could determine the disciplinary action that could be brought about in the case.
Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, has accused PSG of violating UEFA’s rules of fair play.
UEFA can punish a club that loses more than €30 million over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar's transfer does not automatically violate its economic rules.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts, UEFA was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaif of Qatar.

Austin, 21, suffered severe burns from lightning strike - flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing ordinary work on an airplane at the International Airport of Lunch-Florida with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a lightning bolt struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The lightning force threw the plane's wing to the ground near Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
“I asked if he was alive,” Austin’s sister, Autumn, said.
Austin spent two weeks at the hospital.
In addition to burns, he had muscle damage and brain bleeding.
It was a hard experience for the whole family.
You can't expect one.
It’s traumatic for everyone, says Autumn.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was on-site at the time of the incident and the carrier itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and boosts business by cutting dividends
On Friday, the British training group Pearson announced that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and cut dividend by 72% when launching a new restructuring program in response to the pressures on its business.
According to President and CEO John Fallon, job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and early 2019. The company already reduced 4,000 jobs in connection with previous structural arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would again cut costs by £300 million in May as part of its third savings program, which aims to revive the business weakened as a result of rapid digitalization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged. Its revenue grew by one percent in the first half of the year and was £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, saying that a NATO soldier was killed in the attack and several others were wounded.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion at the mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's statement, a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan Army was attacked by a self-made explosive device carried by a person.
The statement said all injured were in stable condition and were treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are major concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20 per cent were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul in an area where predominantly Shiite Muslims live.
The Taliban announced that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in the bombing in central Kabul, the country's deadliest militant group after U.S.-led forces overthrown the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul over the past few weeks have also significantly weakened people's confidence in the government, its politics, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA calls its decision to postpone the implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under the Obama administration to reduce smog-causing emissions a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called “obson specifications” late Wednesday, which the agency said was a sign of its commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states,” Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone definitions for one year until October 2018. According to the specifications, smog pollution is measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 predominantly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to postpone implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate Barack Obama's environmental regulations, saying that the measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increasing emissions.
According to the EPA website, inhaling ozone-containing air can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms — such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, an ISIS leader had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects said the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
Police do not explain why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to excrete toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also being continued.
Neste’s CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Neste’s profit before taxes fell, but beat the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company achieved a good result in oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products reached record levels and the development of the Marketing & Services segment’s operating profit was in the right direction.
Last year, the comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax relief.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even if the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will be able to complete our previously announced strategic investments in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a potential match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match in the near future of a series of less than 66.7 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms in the ESPN sports channel's premises in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, WBO's upper featherweight champion.
Garcia won on Saturday on Showtime by unanimous decision of former four-weight world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on the ranking of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, “How are you, Master?
Good luck with the match.
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven on Saturday.
When the two posed for photographers, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between the men would be — perfect in terms of sizes —
I'm a former featherweight, Garcia reminded me.
“I moved up the series for the [63.5 kg] Broner, but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to the lightweight series.
He must rise to the lightweight series [61.2 kg]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes...
Lomachenko agreed.
Boxing needs this game.
Klimas asked if the match should be arranged on the pay-per-view channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko, according to which Lomachenko will debut in the lightweight series later this year and will fight Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knock-out wins). Garcia would also be interested to face the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight series at the Forum on 23 September.
The match could be on the pay channel because fans have asked for it — Garcia said and later announced she was ready to fight on the channel that offers the best prize package.
We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention.
As soon as we reach an agreement, I'm fine with it.
Garcia said she appreciated Lomachenko as an incredible fighter and that she might be going to watch the Saturday match.
Lomachenko stopped praising Garcia's bed and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked — really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout —
Garcia said she focused first on showing the impact force and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the match between them would be more and more intense.
This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I am definitely involved in this case, Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best. - Mike's a legend.
It's going to be a great match.
Average salary 5,300 euros, training what happens - the investment advice situation was -wild and free -
The quality of investment advice has spoken a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom a banker’s investment advisor spoke full nonsense when selling investment products.
The rules on investment advisors and the sale of different investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightenings are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify competence requirements.
The Financial Industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of degrees to a company called APV Investment Qualifications Ltd, whose degree team consists of experts from both the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and the industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are quite extensive in terms of requirements.
The study material for the degrees includes 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Ltd, says that the pass rate of exams is roughly approximately 70.
Of the staff of the largest banks, approximately all investment services providers have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 degree because their performance is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banker stores without mentioning names whose staff seems to have avoided completing the qualifications, Savikko says.
According to him, there are a number of such bankers.
According to Saviko, the APV1 degree has been completed since 2000 by between 13,000 and 14,000 people, and approximately 3,000 people have completed more demanding APV2 degrees recommended to investment advisors.
Some bankers consider completing a degree to be an advantage.
Several other industries have considerably stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation in the financial sector requires the completion of APV degrees, because it is then that expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average wage for regular monthly working hours is approximately EUR 5,300.
On average, men who work on missions earn over EUR 5,900 per month and women over EUR 4,500 per month.
On average, the 10th highest earner earns about EUR 8,100.
The tenth of the men who earn the most earn more than €9,000 a month or more, one tenth of the women who earn the most earn €6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
Up until now, self-regulation has been trusted at the employee and task level.
According to Fiva, the audit carried out by Fiva received individual cases where the expertise and competence of the investment advisor were insufficient based on the activities of the advisor.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products even if your skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In the first place, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have considerably stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II.
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, on the other hand, will be given the power to determine what needs to be done.
Fiva’s market supervisor Marko Hovi says that one of the clear changes to the present is the regulatory requirements concerning the expertise and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovi, the new requirements apply both to the staff of investment firms and to tied agents who sell products on behalf of an undertaking.
Hovi says that according to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will be given the authority to determine competence and experience.
What exactly they are, will be decided in the coming autumn.
In the future, the company will also have to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and further training.
All of this has to be documented, and the company has the obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The Court states that in practice, the company must, for example, map the staff’s job descriptions at the individual level.
This will certainly come at different levels of requirements depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to the Court, there is also a requirement to work with someone more experienced than the deadline, if the level of competence or experience is not sufficient.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the Court, with the change, the rules become more stringent and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.

The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States by Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted on Thursday, 787 Dreamliner aircraft, on which Boeing tested the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, a flight from Seattle flew a distance of 15,700 km, which is longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight stayed within the borders of the United States.
It flew through 17 states.
Imatra’s persistent beach swimming school students don’t sweat the rain or the sun’s roasting - Iines Kaikkonen continued to pedal with the help of a swimming table village
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run in Sludge and Lempuka this week and next week.
Even though it sometimes rains and then it shines again, young swimmers are not the worst, the head of swimming schools Taina Itkonen praises.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children will gain swimming skills, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and the escort are already starting, Itkonen estimates.
The Imatra Beach Swimming School is organized in cooperation with the Sports Unity project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere on the beach.
The sun was shining and young swimming schoolchildren were training to stay on the surface with swimming sticks, someone even without them.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines from Kaikko, 5, first questioned going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to stroll towards the beach.
You're doing great!
He said he went swimming a lot this summer.
The swimming pool is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, swimming with the village continued to practice swimming with Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with today’s accomplishments, the swimming class said.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted water wars.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for swimming lessons.
No matter what the weather has been, Anna has loved going here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming schoolers packed up on the pier.
The boys had plenty to do with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels to the pier, snacked on fruit, and baked the day.
In the water, the lesson continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
Something that doesn’t belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier sells toilet brushes -- here's a story that connects him.
You can see all kinds of things.
A few days ago, Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product series.
I mean, dishwashers and laundry racks, and a toilet brush with a border brush.
An unknown soldier refers to the film and the marketing of the film that premiered in this autumn.
However, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been mocked on social media: When will the Unknown Health Ties come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Executive Vice President, Siniproduct say?
We are a film partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, Määttä says.
According to him, the products will come in special presentations, and the film will thus get visibility.
Isn't there something funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a commoning story that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
Cleaning is not a stranger to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other corporate partners in the Unknown Soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
To date, Hartwall’s vichys have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already managed by Kalle Kinnunen, blogist of Suomen Kuvalehti
Coffee and clocks are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the premiere of the film, so there is still time to continue.
For example, Valio, Processor, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl have not yet revealed their war products.
New results of Swedish asylum seekers’ age tests have been announced
The latest results of the medical age tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new assessment method reveal that more than 80 % of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone considers the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be minors.
The Finnish Immigration Service has so far commissioned 6,880 tests, and the Forensic Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested, i.e. in 2002, the asylum seeker was determined to be over 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the Forensic Agency determined that the test was - possibly 18 years of age or older -
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was, possibly, under the age of 18.
Tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Bureau of Forensic Medicine says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
The figures are fairly consistent, and there are no big differences in the statistics from the previous months, he told The Local.
Although a large proportion of applicants were determined to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that applicants have lied about their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of the 581 tests and reported that there were 442 cases -- indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older --
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that, in 243 cases, the applicant had openly stated that he was 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints. Then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of humans. The evaluation can be used to determine whether a person has reached puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I think the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age for sure, we shouldn’t pretend that we can,” he told Metro.
However, the forensics agency Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests: “It can generally be said that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test will soon be 18 years old.
Ilonen collapses 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent the 30 points of Mikko Ilonen down with a result strip in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left at number 11, divided on Saturday, but was found at the end of the round to split 41.
In the difficult weather, Ilonen was accompanied by three Bogs by a double Bog.
Others also had a difficult time.
The Englishman Ian Poulter rose to share the top spot in a one under par round, although reported that there was enough work to do with the umbrella.
The weather was rough, but it was a good day, Poulter said.
He shares a top position with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
Governor of West Virginia changes party
Jim Justice, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, announced Thursday night at Trump's campaign event that he was changing parties.
“Democrats simply abandoned me,” Justice said.
“Today I can tell you after a lot of prayers and a lot of thoughtful reflection... today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats...
The crowd burst into applause.
\"Tomorrow, as a registered Republican party member, Justice added.
As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game.
Trump promised to make a major announcement at the West Virginia campaign.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited a mining company from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday that “the transition of Governor Justice is yet another blow to a democratic party that builds barriers rather than a better America”
“Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice’s announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership of any kind and cannot find a positive message that unites people,” RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS news.
The lightnings have sown damage - Thursday will even be a very thunder day of summer
At the end of the week, there will also be more thunderstorms in southern Finland.
During the past week, there has been thunderstorms, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes ignited several fires.
According to a meteorologist, Thursday may be a very thunderstorm of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week there has been lightning especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
In the pöytyä, lightning struck the electrical center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The rescue department received a report of the fire about 15 minutes before midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity center was located in a sauna room at the end of the terraced house.
The rescue department demolished the roof and wall to find the fire bases and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa again, lightning ignited the outbuilding into flames in Harjulantie before midnight.
When the rescue service arrived, the building was already in a full phase of fire, and the rescue department could only prevent the spread of the fire.
A 50-square-foot-long outbuilding burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä another lightning struck a detached house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flashing lightning strike.
The emergency services were there to check the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses were fried.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway line between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when the lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information about the defect was received between eight and nine Thursday morning, after which trains in that period were replaced by buses.
The problem was resolved shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has continued normally on a section of the railway run by thunder.
The lightnings have sown havoc in different parts of Finland.
However, it has been relatively low this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been absolutely turbulent! estimates Finnish Meteorological Institute’s on-call meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
Wednesday and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance of the summer, it also feels strong.
This might seem like a very loud thunderstorm, but that’s what it has been like this summer’s thunderstorm,” Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the land lightnings blinked 1,700 times, and Thursdays have had potential for even the hardest thunder day of the summer: by about 4 p.m. there were 1,790 land lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning continues in the early evening, we can get over two thousand lightnings, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm was experienced in 2015, when the lightning volume of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the lightning volume this year had increased to 18,386 salamas.
So there's still something to catch up on so that this year doesn't break the two-year-old record.
However, the thunderstorm can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid at the end of the week, which is a birth environment suitable for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunders is likely to shift to Saturday from the northern parts of the country to the south, where the days of about 2,000 lightnings can be received on both Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more united rain front in the central parts of the country.
In such a way, he says, he only thunders infrequently.
Coe praises Russia's \"open-minded\" apology for doping scandal
World athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made due to the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end the Russian ban on participation.
Russian athletic leader Dmitry Shljahtin, at the IAAF Congress on Thursday, said that the Russian ban was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry — for all the athletes who were stripped of gold or silver medals in the competitions —
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia had been presented in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA.
“I think his response today was very straightforward, and it was a very open-minded presentation,” IAAF president Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation admitted that the country had gone through difficult times and said that it would do everything in its power to reorganize its activities.
Coe also said he was “satisfied” with Russia’s acceptance of the terms of the ban.
“I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group’s recommendation that this is not the time to end the Russian ban,” Coe said.
In the coming months, we will have to do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete at the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
“Testing is still insufficient, and the coach who has been banned is still free to act,” he told reporters on Friday following a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
Production company disappointed with poor success of Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become as successful as the authors hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I’m disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Annika Sucksdorff, CEO of Helsinki Film, in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it looks like it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is a small figure compared to the film’s budget, approximately EUR 5 million.
This has not become a lottery win, but now it is important for investors to get theirs back.
If the film had done better in their home country, they would have already got their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How Football Economic Rules Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
The rules restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from transferring from Barcelona, Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France, which is the most expensive player transfer ever made in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are decided by the European football regulatory UEFA, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced fair play economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid €222 million to terminate the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary in the new club moves in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its Star Guard, as it follows to finance a dynasty enriched with Qatar's oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large amounts of money on acquiring players, but they need to be balanced with real income sources so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The economic rules of fair play were drafted by UEFA President Michel Platinum, who was elected in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners pulled their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair play economic rules shifted from clubs’ debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases, and created a global brand.
The current three-year review period of the fair play economic rules will run until 2018. During this period, the clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of €30 million.
Although Platini had to leave UEFA's chair in a scandalous manner in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
“The rules of fair play are still in place, and we will apply them in the future as well,” Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press news agency last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can balance the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expense of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair play's economic rules, the first sanctions were issued in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which was funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was ordered to limit its Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market level, UEFA does not calculate the aid as actual income.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s support for PSG was oversized.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's merits in the PSG could be financed by contributions from the Qatar World Cup Organizing Commission for 2022.
However, PSG and the Organizing Committee have denied that Neymar would be an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA is monitoring companies more closely than usual to circumvent the rules.
Sources aware of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on the condition that their identity is not disclosed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published financial statements, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the past period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its net sales will increase by at least 30 percent with the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish League, clearly irritated by the departure of the world's best player, tried to complicate Neymar's move, allegedly violating fair play economic rules.
“This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state — Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, told the Spanish AS newspaper, referring to the Qatari ownership of the PSG.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the government financing the football club's activities, which is owned by an American sports tycoon.
“The case is a result of ownership that has completely changed the football environment over the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
Compliance with the economic rules of fair play becomes very difficult. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state -
Now we are in a hurry: Finnish World Cup athletes coach stuck in Helsinki
The long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and the three jumper Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, although she should coach at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach’s advice.
Pajulahti competes in long jump qualifying tomorrow and Mäkelä competes in three leap qualifying on Saturday.
However, the two's coach, the Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the issue in Britain's broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organisers as a document, but it is also not suitable for obtaining a visa.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, said coaching director Jorma Kemppainen.
He has always handled visa issues himself successfully in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the stadium for the steps, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach might be missing.
The World Cup Medal for FinlandLondon demands a miracle
The World Athletics Championships start in London today on Friday and last a week and end on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the kind of sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other indicators.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one value race to another, where the acquisition of experience matures the athlete’s performance to the level that the Adult World Cup Medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the small Finnish World Cup team, and neither do they.
The World Cup medal for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest and surprise of sports is that miracles can happen.
It pulls bench athletes to the TV screen and glues to watch the races, although the London medals are not solved due to the time difference until late at night.
Of the previous World Athletics Championships in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear-thrower Tero Pitkämäki.
Dareful people are waiting for a medal from Pitkämäki even now, although the second is told by the recent results of him and the other throwers, as well as Pitkämäki's stay in the qualification at the prestigious competition last summer.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will remain in history as a major Finnish sports hero.
For the other Finnish athletes of the competitions, access to the finals or making their own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt of Finland’s athletics in the coming years will be a good success in the international competitions for young people this summer.
The refining of young talents and financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come in an instant, but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns also know how to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully the London Games will go down in history as Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of, for example, the fear of terrorism or cowardly attacks.
Enni Rukajärvi is second in Copper's big air -- but I'm sorry --
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place on Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi’s best big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi scored 147 points in the competition.
With his final jump, he tried the cabalerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
I feel good and feel good now, but I’m sorry that the last jump didn’t go well.
From now on, I will try it again in the race.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new express ship stuck in port in Helsinki
Viking’s new express ship, the FSTR, is very late on schedule.
The express ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There was an eight-hour loading on the ship.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving slightly, Estonian Johannes Rebane, waiting to be boarded at the Port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there was a technical flaw in the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles for those waiting to get on board.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical problem.
It was repaired at the Port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn’s return trip for a couple of hours.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.

Small District Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story simultaneously craves the days of the characters' '80s splendor and '90s grunge' (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a brilliant The State sketch series for MTV) as well as their own time — 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the show moved into larger stories in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous reminiscence we have stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like it’s been around for a while.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (there was a background story of a vegetable can that spoke in H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
At the core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teens approaching adulthood. Its emphasis makes the impossible to reach the past a part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodies, for example, the '90s stalker movies, such as the horror film Hand that rocks the cradle.
At one point, one of the characters digs up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skates, and — some stuff from 1991 to
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (then Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such a series, the best are the side paths.
It’s especially fun to see the age-old Paul Rudd, who has a bearded butt under his lower lip from Matt Dillon’s “soul patch” movie Singles. The Andy, the king of the camp, played by Rudd, is getting old.
The moments of random madness may lift this series to flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: The Americans’ Cold War spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series wrestling catalogue, where the East meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian police drama of the 1980s, in which a Bucharest cop couple fights for truth, atheism, and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring the hard-faced Gregor and idealistic Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici, their lines have dubbed Channing Tatum (the series' lead producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than that.
The show has some good visual jokes (policemen spend time watching chess on television in the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in the imitation of a clumsy socialist drama, for example, with a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask. Therefore, the series often starts to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the show's humor is neither fast enough nor abundant.
In summary, the series might work better as agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby devouring hamburgers.
The message to the imagined Communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the show were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and theirs as well.
Toni Tauru, from Kouvola, will be in the ring in Macau on Saturday against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa fought in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of the jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting myself against my parents.
It’s a fun story, 32-year-old Tauru says.
Kouvola was supposed to be in the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were received with a quick schedule in the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Terror has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my match was cancelled.
It annoyed me, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the contestant is pleased that a new time has been given for the fight.
Waiting for a week has little to do with preparation.
The move doesn't seem to be working out, because it won't improve in a week.
It can get worse if you exercise too much.
In a few of his previous struggles, Taurus has faced opponents whose strengths are in erecting.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvolalainen describes as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he comes on top of the first round hard and tries to take the carpet.
He has won the Jujutsu World Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous game did not go as planned.
The Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Taurus badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially when I'm standing: he didn't get a hit.
When I started pouring, he hit my eye.
It was a shame for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some rise more frequently in the ring.
For example, the next opponent, Issa, fought for the last time in September.
Last year, I had three matches.
This is the second battle of the year ahead.
Sometimes the pace gets pregnant.
I have been training and being in good shape for the past few years.
But I've only fought for the fight.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when we had a friend from Sweden.
Training was a great help, as on Saturday a Kouvola employee will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice a vertical match.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take the property myself.
You can’t give them away for free, because they spend the most.
Macau is attracted to the Tauru that had fought in China before.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think we have a big, great night ahead of us.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been impulsive and inflation easing has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, and the Bank shifted interest rates because of increased pressure on the incomes of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Commission decided by a vote of 6 to 8 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation review, the Bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%. It also warned that household income levels are under increased pressure as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the Bank, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation rate boosted by Brexit, and the Bank announced that loan costs could have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the committee members decided to cancel part of the massive financial package, which began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will terminate the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide low-cost funding to banks in excess of £15 million, i.e. a total of 115 million.
The Bank’s interest rate decision states: “According to the Commission’s forecast, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income reduces consumption,
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated the need for some tightening of monetary policy in order to contain inflation — market expectations — a little more broadly —
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be “gradual” and “limited”.
In May, the bank forecasted a growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and a growth of 1.7 per cent for next year.
Now it kept its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31; compared with the euro, it weakened by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker than expected growth figures dampened the increased expectations for interest rate increases. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The Bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its most recent inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from accelerating inflation and low wage increases, and the bank said the situation would deteriorate even before it got better.
The Bank added that monetary policy — and cannot prevent — a fall in income in the coming years, but expects wage developments to recover — significantly at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will overturn some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made one year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% following the shocking EU referendum result, which plunged the pound down.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will likely start to be reflected in prices and in the economy only after four years.
In July, three decision-makers called for a 0.5 per cent increase in interest rates.
Inflation dropped last month to 2.6% from 2.9% in June, but the bank said it was expected and inflation would rise again in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the excess of its target level of 2% was, in whole, due to a weak pound.
“Given the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to intensify further as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
“Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renews contracts are increasingly popular, have low interest rates and also offer cost-free options”
NHS prescribes 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients may be prescribed an anti-HIV medicine, which is a revolutionary one, and the Supreme Court closed the dispute over the funding of the drug in the English public health system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. The pre-exposure drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's judgment last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for PrEP although claiming that it should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called the decision announced on Thursday — a significant new intervention — and was described by the National AIDS Organization — as a crucial moment —
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to start accepting enrollments for an experiment that expands to other clinics in October. The experiment reaches its full scope in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a pre-exposure HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in risk groups.
A drug taken before intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during intercourse that prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select candidates who meet the criteria for the experiment for men, women, and transgender, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in the treatment of general practitioners can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the English NHS signed a contract this week for medicines after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by gathering broad clinical evidence of its targeting, administration and treatment implementation.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective measures to prevent HIV,” Stevens said.
It is yet another remarkable achievement in the more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of mankind’s greatest health challenges.
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” said Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Agency.
If PrEP is properly targeted to those in need and at risk, it can have a pivotal effect on the English HIV epidemic.
As of September, those at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded experiment, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news...
“The most important thing now is to make sure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group is excluded,” says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
PrEP has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect 10 000 people at risk from HIV infection.
“The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that has been delayed in vain for several months due to slow down by the government,” said Sharon Hodgson, the health minister of the shadow government.
“We have evidence that the drug can have a life-changing effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The experiment helps us to better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully halted.
Quality of life: the interlayer and smart interior solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker excited about the renovation of the property, moved from the Knightsbridge residential area to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house in the style of Queen Anna's era. The success of the renovation is shown by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed her rig and moved.
“Before this, I lived with my ex in a much larger apartment in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
I am looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment screen and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it and made an offer on the same day.
Since then, the apartment of about 90 square meters has experienced a complete transformation.
It was a two-room apartment where the bedroom was only accessible from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make use of the room height.
“I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands, he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed design office in Notting Hill. Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space of nearly four meters tall rooms and creating an apartment that would not only be a renovation and sale site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
Steel structures are quite complex.
The spaces had to be stacked so that there was no need to crouch in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height was just right on top of them as well as below.
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, the copper gridded window of Retrouvius opens into a stylish living space.
Mirror-gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the feeling of space and light.
The mirrors at both ends of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window that opens with a view to another room.
The mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's utensils and glassware.
It’s a great way to hide the kitchen when it’s not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen it is unique that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
“It took a little planning — Erfan tells about the steel-reinforced veneer-surface MDF door.
It is balanced, i.e. it slides very easily when lifting into place.
With a sensible use of space and storage, Joanne got 16 extra square meters, a second bedroom and an even better layout solution.
“When selling a home, the surface area is the deciding factor, or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
In principle, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area
Joanne's apartment increased the area by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The tenant is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly generated based on them,” Erfan says.
No one is attached to the electric wires in the walls.
They are important, but not in the same way.
Joanne’s apartment is an example that good design and extra squares can make the basic apartment exceptional.
It can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiates in her summer look
Princess Sofia's costume selection hit the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a delicate light blue dress.
Sofia was smiling at the event.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, during the day, Sofia represented the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a gorgeous blue-fitting outfit that beautifully dressed the pregnant princess at her last.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue outfit.
This is the last event in which Sofia represents her birth.
His due date is September.
For dinner at the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and an elegant little bag.
The pastel blue was a great dress for the princess.
Sofia has been to Båstad, Sweden this week.
Sofia filled her outfit with a small bag.
Sofia radiated in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even talked to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia laughingly said, referring to her final pregnancy.
He'll raise us with a sweet chili.
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared at the Lahti market, where Thai food was sold.
They did not dare to taste, but walked by.
In the booth, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, among the familiars Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not know Thai at the time.
Since the people did not dare to go to dinner, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the Gulf to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got hooked by a laurel.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened a Thai restaurant in the Lahti Market Hall.
It had two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you’re hungry and places are limited, you can’t leave an empty chair between yourself and a guest.
We slowly got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat on a plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the market hall, but then the restaurant had to move, because it was said that the spices themselves smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was released from the end of the trading hall.
There's room.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times will we be shy to ask the guests if there is room next to us.
Panja knows his customers.
He will be told where he has been and who he has seen.
He knows what food everyone eats.
He has seen how customer life changes and the food club changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring wrapper.
She remembers me as skinny and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than everyone else, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja, who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
She has taught tolerance and internationalism with sweet chili sauce.
He has also opened our sense of taste, our thoughts and our hearts.
Today, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he has had a difficult time, he is always kind.
He's a hard worker.
She goes to the restaurant and goes to the mushroom and the blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant was quietly celebrating the completion of two decades.
Our customers had strawberry cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day went by, at work.
Discovery of an underground base reveals 173 ISIS terrorists ready to strike in Europe
In the early part of the year, security officials received a list of important aspects of counter-terrorism work.
The list includes information from more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data but also pictures of each.
More than 130 people on the list are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a few weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi Army special forces found a list of terrorists' personal data and images while investigating the underground base of a terrorist organization in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed to all European security authorities by Interpol in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after ISIS fell in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons, but also their date of birth, invented aliases, and information about the person’s home country.
The list also lists the terrorist specialties.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads Abu Assid al-Almani, or German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later through Turkey to join ISIS.
A suicide bomber has been written next to his picture.
There is no more accurate information about the man's fate.
A total of about 6,000 fighters have gone from Europe to ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
The man sank below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
According to interviews with the rescue department, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, on-call firefighter at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a report after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of emergency care.
Estlander said it was a 50-year-old man.
According to the interviews, the man wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is over.
Estlander thanks the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
This was a task led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also very well guided.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
He was rescued from the water along with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three were seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of which suffered milder injuries, according to an on-call firefighter.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four o'clock in the day.
The crash occurred when another car turned from behind a warning triangle in front of another car, says an on-call firefighter.
According to the Rescue Department, there is a speed limit of 80 km/h in the intersection area.
Brothers fight over $500 million for property
Two brothers argue over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million, a dispute related to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Colin De Lutis, former chairman of the Carlton Football Club and real estate developer, lives in the Toorak rank area only three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business property between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter controversy about the divorce.
Together, the brothers and their mother Anna own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to accumulate property when they bought a deal on Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded the Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The store chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, property development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds and Paul approximately one-third of the company's wealth. Paul describes his father as the family's carrying power and central figure.
According to court documents, the asset-sharing ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about 316 million dollars and Paul approximately 176 million dollars.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal — Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, the case was tried for the first time in the Supreme Court after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
According to Colin, the claim is not true, and he accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to find a solution to the matter.
“According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me,” Colin said in a statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of false statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the country's best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicacy shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the family's purchase of a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he set up a shop in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their sons in a friendly manner.
“Luigi often said he didn’t want the brothers to end up in court,” Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million while leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are bitter about the economic conditions of their departure.
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former board member of the Australian Football League Club and the best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to his 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
In his text message, he said that he couldn't comment properly because it was being tried in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family’s name into a legal battle,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
“Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way,” Colin continued, saying that he still hoped that a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to be gone.
“Our case will be settled in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff will limit the president’s use of media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico, the White House's new chief of staff intends to limit President Trump's media use and follow-up to the news so that the boss doesn't get in trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawson reports:
“When the White House’s new Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he raised a central problem he intends to solve: he plans to limit the information available to President Donald Trump.
Kelly told White House workers that all the information, whether printed or heard at press conferences, must go through her, because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a relationship with television for decades, and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
“If Presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that sympathetic media handled matters more fairly,” Sam Nunberg, an advisor in the Trump campaign, told Politico newspaper in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that — according to six former campaign workers, managing Trump’s use of Twitter is essential that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of praise —
Okay.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter has never been under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don’t know — maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We’ll probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has even been able to prevent him from causing problems a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing factions in the White House trying to push their cause by providing Trump with information that supports their view. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that advisors deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Reporter Shane Goldmacher told of a case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say that he can be infuriated by newspaper clippings where he is criticized —especially if there are reports of harmful information leaks, and then he is absolutely forced to know where the information comes from.
That happened at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news on GotNews.com, founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Assistant Staff Manager Katie Walsh of several White House leaks of information.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later recanted them, and he also did not present any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun reading the story after asking staff about Walsh —
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, then Chief of Staff, and Rob Porter, then White House Secretary of Staff, had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump,
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to run their own affairs.
These unchanging facts make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with the French football club PSG, according to the news agency AFP.
Earlier Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a buy-out price of €222 million to FC Barcelona, a football league player.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated, and he was free to move to the Parisian club PSG.
The transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
In the past, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros last summer for the French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaif of Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Raija Oranen, a successful writer, has overcome alcoholism and flight fear with hypnosis: “I’m fine with my life.”
From the TV series Rose Time and Pure White Sheets, well-known success writer Raija Oranen just celebrated his 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandchildren hold the grandmother so close to writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring the rental apartment also left.
To the light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raija was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which she has survived.
The external appearance is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were anti-depressants.
I used to get help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also worked for fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, a brilliant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who have worked in the tourism industry, have been together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a queen of drama she has always been, finished her life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has made a huge career as a writer, only remembers well the 44-piece Clean White Sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the recession.
I finally decided to become a fresh family company in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Seppälä’s 50th-year interview on the plane.
I was the daughter of the seamstress herself, my mother also had a clothing store and sometimes I acted as a mannequin.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen’s research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for an active time, she has many manuscripts working on - ideas for hundreds.
The orbiters returned to the alley of the ditch, the millionaires.
The wealthiest houseowners in the West Midlands are once again on a haircut with persistent circuitrs who managed to cross the ditch needed by the municipality and return to the field adjacent to the houses.
Tourers parked their twenty caravans near a street called a millionaire alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the moat that was needed as a barrier to the municipality, bringing children, horses and the army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have blamed the municipality of Solihull for its total inability to solve the problem.
An anonymous resident reports that the orbiters came Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown stones at passers-by.
“The municipality needs to be toughened to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more of them tonight, and probably even more today.
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
“I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality can’t do anything about it.”
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the orbiters returned so soon after they were driven away.
There are more of them, and they have even landed a horse in a grazed park.
According to a spokesperson for Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of the illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. “We are taking legal action with Solihull Police to evict campers as soon as possible.
For the collection of evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police about disruptive or criminal activities.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for the purposes of legal proceedings -
Enraged people surrounded by a Portuguese crash plane
In Portugal, on a beach full of people, forced landings have been interrogated in court today.
As a result of the crash, two people died yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane may be charged with manslaughter.
In Portugal, it can be sentenced to 16 years in prison.
A small plane flown by men had to make a crash landing on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon yesterday due to a technical failure.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of whom ran from the landing plane to escape into the water.
The plane landed on a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit the man who was back on the plane.
Immediately thereafter, the plane got up and when it landed again, it hit the child's head, said Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias, who was on the beach.
The girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
Her parents were not hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash with anger.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating the back of it, reported Celia Rocha in Correio da Manha, who witnessed the incident.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a wonder no more people died.
The two men on the plane were not injured in the crash.
The tragically lost Finnish star again won the World Cup gold: “Without an accident I would not be the world champion”
On Wednesday morning, Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated the World Cup gold in a banked slalom competition held in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari also won the Cross World Cup gold in the past.
All three of the World Cup titles have already been collected.
This is an incredible World Cup!
Twice the gold was taken care of, pretty good heart rate is pulled, Suur-Hamari, who was reached by phone, rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is constantly increasing.
The whole paralumbing has grown and evolved a lot lately.
The differences are decreasing, and there are many new calculators involved.
You always wonder if there's a black horse in the back.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Grand Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age, he had fallen zealously with his friends, and the accident did not take up the desire to get to the slope.
It reminds me of what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's useless to ifs.
Those cards play what is shared, Suur-Hamari emphasises.
It would be cruel to title a serious accident and the loss of a limb as a misfortune, and Great Hamari will not do so.
But he turned the terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Great Hamar’s greatest passion for boarding was already fading.
It was only after the accident that the job to the top started really well.
When I was young, I trained with friends, and we were always excited to kill X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that dim somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself at the X-Games star.
I could not have imagined in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought it would be a very long life if I stayed here to be bitter and sad.
I decided to put on my jumpsuits and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The skier was very pleased to have Leo-Pekka Tähti, a wheelchair rewinder, chosen as the athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his prize at the sports gala held in January.
According to Greater Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the Parasports people.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly open the eyes of the parasports world as well.
When is it time to launch the Double World Champion Matti Suur-Hamar’s Sportsman of the Year campaign?
We'll see about that in due course.
I try to do my best to succeed.
The Great Hamari has not yet conquered all the peaks he coveted.
Next year, there will be a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympic Games will take place in South Korea.
We are going to get a medal!
Majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees frying bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their home country permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seeing any change in the Syrian conflict.
The communication agency chain Burson-Marsteller studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has studied the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February to March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youth aged 18 to 24, half of whom are women and half men, responded to the survey.
Half of the interviews were in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
42% of respondents thought they would return to their home country and 4 percent could not say.
According to the study, young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for permanent return home, while a quarter believe that the most important thing is to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of the key factors in the decision are the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone will not solve the conflict.
Syrian youth were asked what was the most important factor in ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
A quarter of Assad’s presidents hold Assad’s presidency a barrier to a peace treaty.
Almost half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter believe in resolving the conflict through mere military action.
The majority of Syrian refugee youths see ISIS’s power weakened over the past year, while a fifth feel its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and generally against terrorism, is that the media would convey to people the information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people called military measures and education reform a priority.
In the 10th century, the most important thing is to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration’s impact on the Syrian conflict, 66 percent of respondents believe the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Almost one in four believe the conflict in Syria will worsen during the Trump era.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia and Iran’s involvement have improved or exacerbated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the internet organized - the database he developed is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the open source database, which is the fastest growing in the world.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by the coder entrepreneur Michael-Monty, is not costing users anything, and can be developed via the internet by any skilled programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge masses of data remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All information that is not in image format comes from the database, and the images are linked there, too,” explains Widenius.
MariaDB’s Chief Technology Officer, Widenius, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen helps to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later, software giant Oracle devoured Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle deal occurred, a large proportion of MySQL developers announced that they were leaving.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, who didn’t give a sure promise about MySQL’s future,” Widenius said.
He had already started a company that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired some of the best developers from Sun and thus ensured that the continuity of the code was secured with the same friends who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch from it.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of the MariaDB code.
During MySQL, no such verifications were made, Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“In recent years, our growth rate has been about 50% per year,” said Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, does not make a profit yet, and Paqvalén is scarce in terms of the company’s key figures.
That’s how much she reveals that MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million in the current financial year.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps with the exchange of databases, which can be more than a year’s work if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB can be done in an instant because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are paying customers of MariaDB.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft’s Azure, Alibaba’s Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have links to the biggest players.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks — the Paqvalé list.
The database market is still dominated by giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although research company Gartner says the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players like MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing sinters.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases do not reach even a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, because the majority of users pay nothing for these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open databases at the time, or at least the transition would have begun.
Big companies don’t get new customers because most of them choose open source.
This has led to licensing fees for commercial databases being skyrocketed.
Companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers - Widenius ponders.
Since changing a closed database is difficult, the majority of customer companies have ingested price increases obediently.
“There are a lot of customers that are really difficult to switch to because their old applications and others are closed in the database,” Widenius said.
However, he believes that the size of the customers is coming to full.
As license fees increase each year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous one, and the service is better, because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
In addition, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many people change their database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now hiring more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually for databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently,” Paqvalén said.
Widenius is annoyed at how money is wasted in Finland on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper and the subscriber is not at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say that open source is ideology, but in my opinion it is a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that they cannot or cannot do themselves.
In addition to another Finnish developer Linus Torvalds, 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still hold 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this topic.
Italy strengthens its attitude towards civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations that will save refugees on their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules on their activities.
“If NGOs do not commit to the new Code of Conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnit's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized the ship of the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet, whose crew is suspected of cooperating with human smugglers, which promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which had been operating for only a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organization said in a statement published on social media.
“We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet platform since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers who re-accessed the boats.
One such incident is claimed to have occurred only a few miles off the coast of Libya, according to a prosecutor's document, the content of which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area, and is considered a motive for helping.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they did not cause significant changes or obstacles to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those who refused to follow the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, stated that the number of migrants arriving in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which he sees as an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to produce results.
“In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He revealed that there are plans this month to continue discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected to have killed his common-law spouse at Enontekiö, suspect found in the terrain - case to prosecutor
The alleged crime occurred in Enontekiö's Kuttanen last December.
Police say a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
It has been previously reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police also said the suspect had fled with two dogs.
The man was found cold in the terrain, and did not resist when caught.
The case must be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be settled in the District Court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All Hairy Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also starred in films and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of Magic Minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his veterinary role in the All-Hairy Friends television series based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Text Messages Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and phone calls that were used to instigate the suicide of her boyfriend Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, completes 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years of probation.
Carter was convicted of killing in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
“My family is broken,” Conrad’s father said on Thursday.
My son was my best friend.
Carter appealed against the judgment and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, listened to his judgment with his hands crossed with a tearful look on the ground.
“His actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
He ended Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act, the prosecutor continued.
He hasn't shown any remorse.
Carter's lawyer said the incident was caused by shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, felt that neither Carter's age nor maturity level nor even mental health problems had a significant impact on his actions.
The prosecution read Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, in which the mother told me that -- not a day goes by that I would not mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I get through all this. I will try my best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always carry.
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she was \"hunting\" the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“It’s painful to lose the person who’s been in my life every day since I was born. That pain will never stop,” Camdy said.
The case seems to be a precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that incitement to suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a car for carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter had in his text messages spurred his boyfriend to commit suicide.
“Hand yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways — Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just shortly before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, \"You have to do it, Conrad, and you just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy.\"
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the opinions of experts.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published a Knox poll in which he states: “Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison.”
NATO Secretary General: Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to act in such a way that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia relationship had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank the country for its poor relations with Congress, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Audi changes 850,000 diesel engines due to setbacks experienced by car manufacturers
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
The BMW manager said the company believed that — there are more sensible alternatives than driving restrictions — he referred to European cities, including the BMW hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitric oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission neutralizers are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of embracing large car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen. Volkswagen installed scam devices in cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged in the United States, but the actions of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars to circumvent European emissions requirements. The charge was based on a similar study in the United States.
Audi's investigation may significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuela's vote begins a fraud investigation, major protests are expected
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
“This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the election results,” Tibisay Lucenan, president of the National Election Commission, told reporters.
Maduro confirms the end of the crisis
On Sunday in Venezuela, a controversial vote was taken by a council of representatives to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they are in progress at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais, the country's national security forces began taking over the country's parliamentary building on Wednesday night.
The task force is to ensure the security of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-bearing insects. Scientists and farmers are frantically trying to find a solution to the problem.
“Laventel is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has resulted in a clear reduction in spring and autumn rainfall,” says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute for Agriculture in Provence.
This will shorten the life span of lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought a lot of small cascades to the area that spread microbacterials —
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Instead of long spots and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or missing altogether,” Chaisse said.
In other words, there are fewer components containing essential oil.
The solution is sought by intensifying irrigation, slowing down the evaporation of soil moisture, and spraying plants with a mixture of clay and water that protects them. In addition, varieties that are more resistant to drought are developed.
Journalist's murder reveals growing threat in Mexico
The delivery of the once weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and an endless drug war in Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss who is safer: leave the children at home or take them with them to a delivery with a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the chalkboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask journalists for names for each group. No evidence is needed, the findings and sensations are sufficient.
Names are written on the board of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make the news of Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
The violence is non-stop and increasingly targeted by journalists. According to the Journalist Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been attacked and threatened. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoce, editor and source of inspiration.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, though he is present everywhere. The façade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The photo reads: “Righteousness — Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez’s smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a trademarked panama hat.
The meeting is held less than two months after Valdez's death, and reporters discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established, particularly for the handling of journalists' cases, but only two charges have been filed so far, according to the Journalist Protection Committee.
Journalist murderers are rarely tried, as are the thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are grief-stricken and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
“This meeting is a waste of time,” he said.
We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident.
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of 15 May 2017.
He had driven his red Toyota only a few blocks away when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is supposedly related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means the twelfth river.
The shooter drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was saddened by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors move quickly and flow freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is silent.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January.
On the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot dead every day, and there are two-story, decorative burial buildings of drug lords that are larger than many homes.
The state on the coast is —peaceful — when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, founder and director of Riodoc, feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, leading a rival faction that is waging a war against the sons of Guzman.
The case could anger Guzman's boys: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish Riodoce with five colleagues. The shares of the magazine were then sold for $50.
In Sinaloa -- it was impossible to do journalism without dealing with the drug problem -- Bojorquez reports.
Over time, the magazine became familiar with its bold and honest things, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her news coverage in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Editors' Protection Committee for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to be able to continue my life,” he said, receiving the Editors’ Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is Sinaloa’s way of life, Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The reporter must accept the task that falls upon him —or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was sown here — why I didn't tell you what was going on —
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez - a joker who cursed like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always got a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if the routine was his fate.
The death of a colleague has also led them to consider how best they can do their job and stay alive.
“Criminals don’t like it when we talk about their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of cases, Bojorquez says.
In the best case, it meant strong self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Andres Villarreal, a journalist at Riodoce, is that the impression can fail, and that was the case with Javier.
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought into the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had been revealed that only spyware sold to governments had followed activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of the tree from a 40-degree heat.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoce's premises, located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some reporters speculated in half whether these two policemen were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
It had been months since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, Riodoce's delivery planned three main cases.
The brother of Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government's spending of money had focused on the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had a kidnapped group of people.
There was no official information about who had been abducted and how, so we had to proceed cautiously: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out in public documents that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician from the ruling institutional revolutionary party (PRI). PRI has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of much publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place, one of them —El Chapo — Guzman’s son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column provided reliable information about the abduction.
“Previously we would have known what had happened,” says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed “El Flaco” because of his slender physique.
Now all the connections to our sources of information are broken.
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse that stores signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists. The newspaper's employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for freedom of the press.
Miriam Ramirez, a journalist, took a few signs with her as she left the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a protest that was caused by another journalist's murder.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations, “SOS Press” texts appear on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez met with the Governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from the government cases because he is concerned that his anger cannot be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists are surrounded by organised crime, crime-allowing authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the command of politicians and security forces in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articleulo 19 monitoring group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez said.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
There was a message signed by the Zetas cartel at his body: I am here because of my writings.
Next to his cut-out head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to cease operations, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua, following the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message to drug cartels on his front page: “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their states or from the country as a whole.
It's a difficult decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals find a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who once had to become a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
“I became a reporter because Mexico is on its way to hell,” he said.
Some time ago, reporters at Riodoce sat in front of the delivery on the sidewalk on Friday at midnight with a beer when the latest issue of the magazine was completed.
19 people were killed in a shooting between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan beach resort.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters put news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The front page had to be redesigned the next day.
Sirens howling nearby - another shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the police guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The delivery of Riodoce continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive portrait, where the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down the operation. How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked us to get out on the street and do the same day Javier was murdered?
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback -- a hard place --
In April, Hannu Manninen’s celebrations were short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period began catastrophically when Manninen got sick with the flu.
It began a long period of illness that lasted for almost five weeks.
May was almost completely sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was the kind of pediatric disease like an ear infection that I had to take with antibiotics.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned exercises.
I can’t remember the last time I was so sick.
It was a hard time when I couldn’t make use of my passion for training,” Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion only received a training permit in the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU Roller Mat Test conducted on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis with roller skis on a carpet, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After each three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last autumn I spent 32 minutes on the carpet, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
A wall came up, Manninen said.
In a better direction
After the initials, Manninen says that she has remained healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize my body’s metabolism.
Now there is a really good five-week period.
It was also a week and a half of flight time.
My family and I also had time to go to the cabin.
Last season Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening competition, when Manninen became 18th in top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and the head coach of the national team Petter Kukkonen have made a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to the last season.
After the first snow race, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, the plan would be to participate at least one weekend of the World Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would still be included in Seefeld.
I hope the name will be on the Olympic team list.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would be Mannise's sixth Winter Olympics already in his career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002 the moorman underscored the gold in the team competition.
Dinosaur Protects From Enemies
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings of a rhinoceros-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that scientists could even determine that its scaly skin was red-brown and had had a -- a problematic past --
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of all time and the world's best representatives of its species.
The recently discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived between 110 and 12 million years ago during the Cretaceous period.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, an armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
There, for six years, the beast was excavated from a 1,100-pound boulder.
The results of the hard work can now be seen.
“If you squint, you can almost believe it was asleep,” says science writer Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at Tyrrell’s Royal Museum.
It remains in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha’s studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor masked it from predators, and it was also protected from the top by a darker and lighter coloring, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old Nodosaurus made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope, after Mark Mitchell, a Markmitchell museum technician, who was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so surprisingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by the general coloring, where the body is darker on the top and lighter on the bottom.
The observation was still a surprise, as Borealope is significantly larger than the existing animals with a similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the dinosaurs that eat meat preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival instead of fighting.
Of modern animals, for example, deer, zebras and armadillos have a similar coloration. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
“The capture of a large, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scales of the Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, including studying its gut contents to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into the river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to extend much further than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is really significant because its scaly leather has been preserved and has also been preserved three-dimensionally in its original form,” Brown said.
That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
It does not require much imagination to perceive it: if you squint a little bit, you can almost believe that it was sleeping.
The Cretaceous period was an era of theropods, huge bipeds, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealope, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included Acrocanthosaur, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings from Nodosaurus researchers have been published in Current Biology, believing that Borealope washed into the sea after his death and mummified into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved armored dinosaur with skin and armor from muzzle to hip.
Nodosaurus averaged five meters long and weighed up to 1,300 pounds.
Two half-foot spikes were raised from their pallets.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the present-day West Canada until it was transported to the open sea by a flooded river.
Its armor has survived down to small details in an undersea grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its leather remains in armor's pitted plates along its skull.
In fact, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such a survival is — as rare as a lottery win.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
Its cranial armor's pitted plates still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forew is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on its sole -
How did one activist learn to answer the question: To whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his high school friend:
The police just killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street.
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information on his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about Michael Brown's death. White police had shot unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
“This is incredible,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told they were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police closure tapes and screaming people, as well as a man who claimed to be Brown's father, on the sign that he was carrying, saying, \"Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son.\"
Ferrell followed a real-time video of the police standing in front of the protesters with a barking dog.
He says he also saw a video of another cop tuning his rifle and shouting, \"I'll kill all of you... animals.\"
This is not normal - Ferrell remembers that he did.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we’ve already gotten used to and could be called typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying...
He booked a return flight home the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock in the evening, and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been the documentary film, Whose Streets, which premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, as well as strength and perseverance from the point of view of the local people who went out on the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards Ferguson with their daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a crown compatible with it, they re-discussed what it was like to live as a black person and under what circumstances they had talked about it countless times before that morning.
Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for what they believe in?
We're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right.
“I couldn’t take my daughter with me,” Ferrell said later.
Today's events are the culmination of past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow up in it.
He must be prepared for activism and organization, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living as a black person, and he must know what we must do to be freed, to free ourselves.
Fortunately, although I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like other black girls.
I feel like I'd hurt her if I protected her from reality.
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is opposite the police station. It became a campground for activists as they waited for information on the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to view activism in a new way.
“My activism changed completely after August 9th,” he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of the Association of Minority Nurse Students. At that time, he focused on food law and health differences in black communities.
I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened...
Weeks later, in an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar simply wanted to tell you what was happening.
He asked me, \"Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?\"
The suspicion was based on the countless times people appeared in the local community, usually whites, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and persistence.
“We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice,” Folayan said in an interview.
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, known for his activism with prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement prompted Ferrell to join the project together with six other locals. The crew followed the events during the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how the local people were portrayed in the movie, because I was portrayed in the same way.
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was wanted to show that the popular movement - not a charismatic leader, but a community - Ferrell proved to be the most transparent to be depicted.
That’s why the documentary shows surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt pretty naked — Ferrell laughs when he tells me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
But I understood that this work and the human depiction of blacks require a certain vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell's story re-emerges and re-emerges the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
“The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going,” Ferrell said.
Black queer women have had to endure everything.
Folayan agrees: “The movement is indeed maintained by black women, among whom there are many queer women.”
However, he points out that Ferrell was not selected for the documentary —self-intentionally — because of his queer identity.
“He got the energy moving,” Folayan said.
But it's no coincidence that he was in the front line, and black queer women live at the cutting point of many things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen...
The news crews have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the relationship between the community and the police remains tense.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of probation left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeway at a demonstration.
His description of the social political climate of his home corners is short and concise:
Yet he continues to rely on the slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.
Suitable similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has been hung in the middle of the exhibition space with faces —white, black and brown faces, between which you can see the resemblance in more detail.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he served his 35-year sentence, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
Its background is two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transgender and groundbreaking dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third last day of his term in office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit slightly theoretical statement on the malleability, ambiguity, and underlying cause and effect relationships and identity of DNA data.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly identified herself with women since puberty. She was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a grainy black-and-white selfie, in which a bothersome Manning sits in a car in the driver's seat. He has a platinum-lit wig on his head that became his hallmark.
Dewey-Hagborg had a hugely popular Stranger Visions project in 2015, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data. He received DNA data on cigarette butts and gums, for example, and created images of what the people involved might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story,” Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference.
So the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making Manning a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became correspondence friends, and they wrote each other for a couple of years.
They even co-wrote the Suppressed Images comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, describing a future in which the president would have mitigated Chelsea's sentence and would be able to watch the exhibition.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence to just a few days after the publication of the comic book, a lucky coincidence after seven hard years spent in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is opening right now as Donald Trump is waging his own war against information leakers and transgender soldiers and is still finding new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful divisions he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that everything has its purpose.
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and underneath it is Manning's great signature, where the point of the last name i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to the automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based.
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long sequence of letters C, G and A written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters — or nucleotide, as is the scientific definition used by the artist — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in genetic heritage and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations,” says Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells countless stories. Here you can see 30 to 30 of them.
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from Manning and Dewey-Hagborg's comic book.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
“If they can silence you, they’ve won, it says in the picture.
Don't ever be silent.
“The text is from a letter I received from Manning — an artist from Philadelphia tells me.
It's so impressive that I still get cold colors.
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil on a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
“The faces were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring a crowd of people to them,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea created, which was also behind her release.
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
Police say they launched nationwide searches to find Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
Cook County court documents show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau. Arrest warrants have been issued for first-degree murder without the possibility of being released from bail.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local bulletin published by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple incision wounds on his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
University Vice President for Social Relations Alan K. Cubbage said in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and is denied access to campuses at Northwestern University.
“This is a criminal case investigated by the authorities, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation,” Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A statement sent by the University and Somerville College spokesperson by e-mail states that “we have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in every possible way”
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's chief of information, said he strongly urges suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“Police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly focusing on our search,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities assist in the search for suspects.
He said the police received a call from the property manager at the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as terrible.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board issued the following statement to residents: “Police is currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim and possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and kill Muslims in London
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m Catholic,” he told police.
Moffatt must complete 100 hours of unpaid community service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and kill all Muslims.
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted, among other things, of aggravated harassment.
Police said they were alerted by the bookstore staff on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the events in the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as a suspect in the bookstore events, a police spokesperson said.
“I’m not an anti-Muslim, I’m Catholic,” Moffatt told police.
As a penalty, a man must complete a hundred hours of unpaid community service and pay £620, or £690, legal expenses and £85, or about €95, compensation to victims.
According to Scotland Yard spokesperson, several hate crimes are not reported.
“We will bring the WADA roadmap to a conclusion in the near future,” Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the World Anti-Doping Agency's road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission RUSADA.
Some of the measures under the road map have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
WADA's road map has been updated in these respects - Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA Road Map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the powers of the RUSADA. The second part of the Road Map was recently published on the organization's website.
It does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future — Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly approve the results of a study by WADA-sanctioned Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren investigates the alleged role of the state in the doping of Russian sports.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we can't admit what didn't exist...
Mutko's words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Earlier that day, Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping organs.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally, however, he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, after the scope of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, WADA director Olivier Niggli visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the organization was on the right track towards restoring powers.
British organisation skeptical of Finnish beloved innovation: The health benefits of maternity packages - there is no evidence -
The British organization has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
The BBC and Guardian, among others, say that Lullaby Trust, an organization that fights SIDS, prohibits the use of its own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women begins this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity kit reduces the risk of SIDS.
Surrender death is an unexplained sudden death of a baby.
Lullaby Trust is an expert on safe sleep for children in the UK.
We no longer allow our official brochures to be packed into them because it would imply that we recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand born.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland’s good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teen pregnancies.
Giving each family a box may be a factor.
But that can’t be said for sure,” said Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity kit is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers free of charge in Finland for 80 years.
The package contains a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no cradle or crib available.
The organization recommends using the pack only for daydream and stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and ensuring that they do not get wet or dirty.
A quick villain escapes from a Japanese zoo for the second time
Japanese zoo staff are looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the villain left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won’t die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried,” Yoshimi Yamane said.
The runaway 35-year-old villain is a female, 55-pound, and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the villain is allowed to walk freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of a turtle.
The villain's last runaway happened the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 metres from the zoo.
I noticed it on my way to the zoo.
“I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help,” Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Help Your Business Avoid Uber Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the polls were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious of them.
“The questions were simply not consistent or objective,” Errett says. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online store. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have entered the market, helping other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target specific teams and populations, and provide anonymous notification services to their employees and, in some cases, direct contact with senior management past the board.
“You can monitor your health with applications like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company’s Fitbit?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides analytics software for companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint’s software for three years. He says he has a more in-depth view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
With the program, you can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, you can draw up a map from which you can see at a glance at which departments employees are most unhappy and which managers have received the weakest estimates. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill into the core of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil since a former employee wrote on his blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments, could reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Located in Denver, Colorado, Convert is a startup that helps companies detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation suffered a blow.
Convert has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to make customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously by text message.
And if there is reason to doubt the manager about the inappropriateness, the complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
“Public opinion has overtaken the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convert.
He points out that if a company treats its employees badly or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Converter for over a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of operating principles and procedures and can easily connect to the head office.
In the past, the practice was that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he first had to find out a phone number or email address that was able to file a notification at the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” says James Vitrano, chief legal officer at Ruby Tuesday, who said that complaints from employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and treated more quickly.
“I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
We protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation.
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical activities in connection with the Enron scandal.
It was only with social media that companies realized that they could no longer stop the public investigation of their dirty laundry.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under ethical control,” Quinlan said.
Glint and Convert offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by venture capital investors. Both Glint and Convert have support from venture capital investors.
In February, Convert raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, corporate culture and risk capital.
Several studies have shown that employees expect more from their workplaces.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they give their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the success of a company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” said Nina McQueen, director of LinkedIn, who is responsible for employee remuneration and well-being.
Investors get returns when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they’re of interest to investors.
According to experts in workplace culture, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered a sign of change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations,” says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm, who has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
If the company does not take action, the employees will start to wonder if they have been heard.
Does their opinion matter?
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company...
According to Errett, Madison Reed currently conducts monthly employee surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day as it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help them improve the long-term sustainability of their employees in an industry known for their high turnover.
“If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees,” Vitrano said.
If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
Without customers, there are no companies.
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked female neighbor, according to the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at her home after she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of the rope outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera shot into the apartment.
The woman who was frightened of the incident had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon afterwards recalculated into the window.
The 20-year-old suspect admitted to photographing the woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed, and the police had not been able to return it as evidence.
In the hearings, the man admitted to the act, but denied committing the crime.
The man was justified by saying that he loved his neighbor -- a madman --
According to news agency TT, the man is charged with the case.
Teachers call for more liksa in autumn negotiations
Wage developments cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed,” OAJ chairman Olli Luukkainen said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday money highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to conclude agreements in which, in some way, there would be no cuts in holiday money involved in the examination.
In the municipal sector, contracts are expected to arise only after private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages are known.
Luke predicts that, for example, OAJ’s working conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage goals of Luke did not yet reveal.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public sector-trained negotiating organisation.
Luukkainen: Cut in holiday allowance increases earnings development differences
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is deteriorating, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luke, a fixed-term holiday allowance cut further exacerbates differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many pupils per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are constantly increasing.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
Bruins players' day extended as NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have been left to chat on the other side of the campus' new training fields.
Some of them have taken off their jerseys, and their backs are shiny with sweat after the first day of training camp.
For a lot of people, this is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, players studying at the university's summer courses return to the dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning, they meet at the Wasserman football center at half past seven o'clock.
“The next three days are going to be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday changed to Tuesday.
The umbrella organization of college sports reduced the number of daily training sessions from two to one. The change was intended to reduce the number of players’ workload, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final exams will be held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three exercises started over 7 o’clock in the evening. It was hard to find space in the players’ already full schedules.
Restricting training sessions to one day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in the six seasons of Mora during the Westwood Coaching season, when the exercises are held at the same time as the summer courses.
Exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20, when the actual preparation for the season's opening match begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says she supported the NCAA's rule change, although it made the players' schedules even tighter.
“We’re really loading them out for three or four days, and that’s very challenging,” Mora said.
But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think it'll get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes rehearsals from the outside after camp. It is not easy considering the direct view from the training fields to the adjacent parking area and Lusk Center, a high-quality hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
“We have security arrangements,” Mora said.
“It’s a concern that people can book a room and shoot exercises on video from there. That’s not an exaggerated concern.
A lot of money is paid for a video of the exercises.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my head too much.
We have a plan...
Freedom to Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central Africa on Friday, the winner of which will already be considered clear.
Paul Kagame officially strives for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by extremists.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized, among other things, for crushing the opposition and restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics, for example.
For the third term, Kagame is allowed to run because the constitution, which limited the presidency to two terms, was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been carried out and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in the unification of the country divided by the genocide.
Rwanda's success has prompted many Africans to ask whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has also promised his people more freedom after the country has been raised to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by intensifying fact-checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more to independent fact-checkers and present the results under the original article. The world’s largest social network announced it on Thursday.
The company published a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to fact checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest fake news spreaders. Many believe that fake news influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has emerged into political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, preparing for the September elections, supports the plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content quickly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that the fact-checking will be tested in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t pass the screen of independent inspectors. They also want more background information so that they can decide more clearly what to read and share — the Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the Related Articles feature and will make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Origin of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for Squeeze's music video and as Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now, in a charming location in the Bewl river valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer fond of old documents.
“I think it’s great to be able to study the text written by someone who died over 300 years ago,” Rhodes says.
I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand.
The book of Rhodes, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotney from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story is illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared from him, inspired by documents from the British National Library. The project was emotional.
“I moved into tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter. The letter was written by a double agent working for Jacobites in the 18th century,” Rhodes said.
It was his fingerprints!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time the lighting was used as a fire.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archives.
A writer attracted to old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the English National Arts Council, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay for a little longer than he would have liked.
He spent days exploring the Victorian —new — castle, archives, treasures and rarity, such as hyenaheads hung on walls and bottles in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and talked with forest rangers, gardeners, and sometimes also book illustrating artists.
In the evenings, he took whiskey and began to write,
Scotney's nearer history is rather unknown, as the castle was completely transferred to the National Trust only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff were just beginning to review the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years using the same method: by taking all the extra to the attic.
There were journals, letters from the times of the English Empire and maps of who owned what. “You could imagine that land disputes are boring,” Rhodes says. “Here, however, families fought even for one birch.
I thought it would be nice to be...
Some of the book's stories progress from castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who joins the English peasant revolt shortly after the castle was completed in 1381.
“Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380 — Rhodes reports.
The English peasant revolt began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could start in riot.
Perhaps these events are related to each other...
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, the story of a priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney.
The men of the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to bet on heiress.
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life’s Hill, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, from which only a eutrophication plot remains.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
It was sad to leave, he said.
I didn't want to go back to this damn day-to-day thing.
Russia's worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated significantly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War,” Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continued instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukraine region, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, NATO remains committed to act in such a way that tensions do not peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, US President Donald Trump said that the US-Russia relationship had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank the country for its poor relations with Congress, which approved the new sanctions against Russia last week.
Vladimir Klitshko to end rematch against Anthony Joshua
The long-time heavyweight world champion of professional boxing Vladimir Klitschko ends his career.
Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought as a professional 69 times, winning 64 out of the matches.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him with points in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match by knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
Klitshko, however, found no motivation for the match.
“I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley match,” Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitschko's reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitschko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitschko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
This is the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple have one child, Kaya, a daughter born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers controlled the World Cup titles of various federations at the same time.
Finland’s weather-breaker is witching the conditions:
Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer’s outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken away from the woman.
Even the London World Cup has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
The conditions have been this summer against the polekeeper Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn’t even get the little poles to move properly,” Nikkanen said after Innsbruck’s race.
I’ve competed and practiced here no matter how many times I’ve never experienced such a varied wind in this place,” Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmin Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have also been such unstable winds in the exercises,” Nikkanen said in Kaleva’s competition.
The weather was on Thursday in London.
It has been quite a challenge to get the technology together - whether it's cold stuff or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away the vibe.
It doesn’t make sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He won the 455 World Cup.
There's been 445 outside.
Not everyone in London is the same.
You have to be calm and wait for better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 on Friday's qualifying.
Why don't you move abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and the technique stabilized.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally, the hall has been trained, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the ideal race?
Twenty-five degrees warm.
A little wind is fine, as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-official has been harassing politicians at Yle: “We have no room for division now or for many years.
Despite the positive climate of the economy, Juha Sipilä’s government must keep ice in its hat and be careful not to overwhelm the state budget with debt money, says Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there is no room for division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed Retired Virta in Ykkösaamu on Wednesday.
Construction of the state budget for next year is about to begin.
Recently, politicians’ proposals for raising the guarantee pension, lowering the car tax and supporting electric bikes, among other things, have been raised.
They are basically telling us that elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for division now or for many years.
I even think it’s a fraud to talk about a splitter when you take out debt,” Virtanen told Yle.
He added that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as budget secretary and then worked as deputy head of the Budget Department and budget manager.
The last time he retired, he was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the 3% growth forecast is likely to be temporary.
All the forecasters estimate that this is a spike from which we are going to go to the underwhelm next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington Changes Permanent Residence Permit Rules
President Donald Trump announced that the permanent residence permit, or Green Card rules, would be amended with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
The Queen of Denmark does not want to be buried in the same place as the Queen.
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret in April.
Queen Margareta of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henrik, 83, are not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the royal couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It’s no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy,” Lene Belleby, chief of communication at the court, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated on an equal footing with his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the wish of her spouse's burial site and understands the decision.
Horror on the road: The car was coming on the highway
There was a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive money from insurance if the other party is not reached.
The accident occurred at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive image from the construction site of Kehä III.
Tommi says his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her common-law spouse Riina and the couple's two small children drove on the freeway at Keimolanporti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the junction of Ring III to the Hämeenlinna fairway, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was to drive to the side of the family car, Tommi says.
If it wasn't for the evasive movement, the car would have come with Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand,” Tommi says.
The family's car hit the railing at high speed.
The parents and the two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is a little under three years old, the other is under one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one drove even towards us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car on their own.
Staff from the ambulance and rescue services arrived, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car was ready for redemption.
Tommi says that he and the cohabiting partner have a small income, and they received a grant from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family will not receive the insurance.
That's why the family wants eyewitnesses to find out about the car, which is why the family drove to the railing.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take children to the nursery and work without it,” Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or early 2000s.
He thought the start of the car registration number was SIG.
If we don't catch the culprit, I don't know how we're doing financially, now we're gonna have to count every cent.
Tommi hopes that people who have seen or heard of it will be in touch with the police.
The East Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a job at the accident site on Tuesday night.
Title and story corrected at 9.15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally said in the story, the other car did not come with the lane of the incoming, but was driven from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
Directed by Lotta Jäppinen, the performance deals with relationships through humor - The self-discoverer will be seen at the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen from Kouvola brings her first introduction to the What? theatre.
The self-discoverer is a musical theatre performance of relationships and inadequacy that have gone wrong.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
This issue is addressed through humor.
There are no bad feelings, he said.
According to Jäppinen, the rotating summer theatre performance has been carried out with a small budget and a large young heart.
The title of the performance challenges you to think about what you reveal about yourself when you get to know a new person.
Is he pulling a role, or is he approaching the other one with his coat open?
The plotless presentation confuses fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and has no plot.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasises that the Self-disclosure does not directly tell about his or her own or the working group’s relationships.
Facts and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own values will be passed on to the show.
I don’t think relationships are bad, but I also don’t think relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Exhibitionist draws a current picture of young adults living in 100-year-old Finland.
Many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The music is composed by Jäppinen and Rokan.
The love for the theatre was sparked in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to be a director of theatre expression at the Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
It's two years back, and there's another one.
Jäppinen’s enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the years of Kouvola.
The grown-up of the music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola theatre and played, for example, at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and last time at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Guidance is becoming more and more interesting.
The self-revealer premiered last week in Helsinki on the Narr stage.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes could also be seen in the future, at least in the student city of Jäppinen in Turku.
Exhibitionist Kouvola's What? at the theater on 4 August at 7 pm and 5 August at 2 pm and 7 pm.
Finnish Olympic winner recovers from a terrible motocross accident for one year - neck fractured
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The ace of Kumparelatus toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on earth that a chemist would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There’s always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I spent a year licking wounds in my home, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the crash.
Driving a bike can sound crazy.
But I didn't apply for it.
It’s just so hard that a 40-year-old like you shouldn’t be doing too much!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long run behind the Japanese freestyle team as head coach.
Lahtela started her career immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn’t really do much, Lahtela said.
Even during his training, Lahtela often challenged his protégé on the slope and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my own thoughts didn’t even make sense.
Not even in the sport.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it because for once I just got to be.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland’s head coach.
Without stopping, he is afraid that he will burn out.
It is easier to find places in the body that are broken than intact!
Without the accident, I would not have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I switched motocrosses to frisbee golf!
It just got out of my lap right away.
At my worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Even though Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer, she does not demand that her trainers be the same as hers.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
In our culture, there is room to be your own kind and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming and we should be worried.
It’s here: a report on technological developments in the sex robot industry — just when it had begun to feel like 2017 can’t get any stranger.
Yes, sir.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
“We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously,” said Noel Sharkey, a founding member of the Foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot’s eyes, the shape of the nipples, and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are being shrugged, but they’re already being sold quite a lot, and we’re going to see more of them,” Sharkey said at the report’s release.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin, as well as features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human use.
The user can also customize the robot to their own preferences from eye color to nipple shape and fingernails type and color.
All the more worrying, robots have a personality that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of a RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, such as shyness.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as fully as possible to the user’s personality — the company’s website is advertised.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, in a mood, or in a mood.
There are many worrying features of the proliferation of sex robots, which replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, as the user approaches, for example, a programmed robot that is shy and resistant.
True Companion compares Roxxxy robot on its website to vibrator:
Women have vibrators, so why shouldn't men have sex robots?
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalization and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: a recession from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many start acting strangely or insultingly only when the market gives it permission.
It’s no coincidence that sex robots are starting to become more common at the same time as women’s rights are under threat around the world and there’s a president in the White House who has bragged about harassing women.
In the television series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Slavery) is not the most worrying of its powerful imagery, for example, pictures of hanged bodies and exhumed eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
They try to make sex robots as much like real women (in terms of pornstar proportions) as technically possible.
The developers of robots want their skin to feel real and their movements to mimic human movements as well as possible.
However, their personalities are far from reality.
A robot cannot leave a relationship or situation.
They have no will of their own, no history - no fantasy of independence or complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect that two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, the group was led by ISIS chief
The chief of the extremist organization ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, an ISIS leader had also sent parts of the bomb to Sydney.
Suspects said the bomb was to be taken to the aircraft on July 15, but the company was interrupted before the security check.
Police do not explain why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a device to excrete toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport vehicle.
Deputy Australian Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
As a result of suspected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also being continued.
The good side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like the epitome of common sense
In the Trump era, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that the strong division of voters has also broken families at the everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, the advisory boards of American newspapers instructed how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
They want us all to burst our information bubble.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to unite families.
I'm telling you about this because my cousin was visiting me this week in New York, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, who has long been at odds with the Republicans in our family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all my cousins — including a Republican-pro-sister, with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it’s a good thing, but in a broader sense, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given the left a new impetus, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to be horrified by his tricks.
In the long run, there is an even more terrifying possibility that Trump will normalize the Republicans on the right extreme, which suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney’s subdued version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least his tax returns we’ve seen). Compared to Trump, they seem like very minor violations.
When Trump’s term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate needs to be clear-headed, and it immediately feels like a remarkable improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to the Central Park Carousel, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
The horses of the carousel are huge, the characters in the middle — the grotesque clowns and the animals that look back in horror — are ominous, and the underlying roaring music is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York City’s hallmarks become disillusioned over time: the view from the tall buildings is getting tired, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar and the city’s reality doesn’t match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a big roundabout in Northern London.
The Central Park carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — even to the extent that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked for my review, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week at the department store to rate my — my payment experience — on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the reader.
The same thing happens in a café in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15% service money with the estimate when I go to pick up coffee myself from the counter.
This slows down everyday interaction and pressures the customer service representative to put their personality in the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The lady at the department store smiled with regret when I tired of giving five stars to my credit card experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter -- there was no leadership trust --
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuqi club's representative team from the position of coach.
The coaching responsibility is assumed by Fabrizio Piccare, formerly an assistant coach.
The rest of the training group will continue in its current tasks.
Piccareta has previously been an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
The 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter’s coaching group in January, has completed the UEFA Pro license last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FC Inter, regrets what has happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the trust of the club’s management, so there was no other option now,” Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta’s contract is valid until the end of the season.
Together with the rest of the coaching team, he is responsible for the home match against HIFK tomorrow.
According to reports, the team has been in turmoil throughout Thursdays.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta strongly clashed in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Violin artist Linda Lampenius posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hasstags have been added to the picture to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student.
Lampenius himself wonders about the young woman who is looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he was communicating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, he posted a photo of himself on Instagram.
In one picture, she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius ponders his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and how I look.
After the text he had added to English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating troubles in previous years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 because of anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also fell ill with bulimia, which was finally revealed only in 2006.
Healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius delivered to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital.
Last year, he received hospitalization for cuts on his wrists, which, according to prison officials, he received after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing multiple shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence too mild.
The Prosecutor General intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be considered as early as this year.
If the appeal is accepted, Pistorius' sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, according to the country's Foreign Ministry, according to the bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized camped people in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st, with two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
According to television channel bTV, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and already impose substantial fines on anyone camping outside the designated areas.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry indicated that the court may impose a fine.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares of the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the UK. It causes abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen bowel resilience.
Marco Colonna, director of the study, said immune cells guarded the swamp and ensured that harmful microbes hiding in the food did not enter the body.
Cells that balance cells that cause inflammation, which strengthen resilience, protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, the result may be irritable bowel syndrome.
The studies found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are present in mice with a specific bacteria in their intestines.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of cells that promote resilience. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome,” says Professor Colonna.
The more tryptophan in the diet of mice, the more such immune cells they had.
If the same works in humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal resilience and reduce inflammation sensitivity.
In the study of immune cells that strengthen tolerance, the postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they were not found in mice of the same species, which were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbiome of the mice' intestines, i.e. the normal community of bacteria, fungi and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were observed in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri was administered to mice in a sterile environment without intestinal microbiome and without developing immune cells, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluids — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of tolerance cells increased by about 50 percent. When tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same resistance cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan by-products from Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in people with Irritable bowel syndrome.
“We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines,” Cervantes-Barragan said.
High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalisation.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got into the ranks — a genius — after signing with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got into their ranks — a genius — after signing with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder debuted with Manchester United in a match against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
Matic, who moved from Chelsea for £40 million, started with a 2 to 3 win in Dublin, United's final season in the preceding match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
Matic was not in the best shape yet, however, because he was not involved in the Asian tour of the blue shirts before the start of the season. He only managed 45 minutes on the pitch - it has to be changed by Mourinho before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence and mindset make him a genius — he has a natural football mindset,” Mourinho said.
We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later.
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done a great job, by acquiring three of his four priority players.
Three out of four, I have to thank the club for that, he added.
I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job.
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualification tournament to Germany in a straight line 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany’s routine level of play is high.
Their game was steady in every sector, Finland’s head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents tight, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the group.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to swing along,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective score was 14 points by Piia Korhonen.
Three of the four matches lost will be against Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already sent out challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kremlin links.
Reuters, the news agency, also confirms the information revealed earlier Thursday by the Wall Street Journal about the convocation of a grand jury.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent out challenges related to the meeting of Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-known Veselnitskaya, which took place during the June 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Donald Trump Sr. then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, White House current adviser Jared Kushner, were also present.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington marks a condensation of the pace of the Russia investigation.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a grand jury to assist in an investigation that sought to investigate Russia's involvement in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or his close associates cooperated with Russia in the matter.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to collect evidence, send challenges, and force people to testify under oath.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence investigated by the prosecutor's investigation and decides whether the case should be prosecuted.
British inventor microchips himself to get to his home and car with a hand swing
The British inventor is the first in the country to microchip himself so that he can open the outer door of his home, get into his office and start his car with a hand swing.
The microchip is between the thumb and index finger of 33-year-old Steven Northam. Now he offers service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with the technology of Northam’s BioTeq company.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, an anesthetist consulting the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the installation of the microchip meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as in the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. Processing one lock costs £300.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed microchip technology both in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for an American production event cost taxpayers $24,000, according to military documents received by TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the president is on board. It was a attraction at an event at the White House on 17 July 2017 that featured American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of White House officials were introduced to the products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter made in Connecticut, a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi were exhibited.
The White House military office had requested a helicopter station by mission order only about 36 hours before its landing on the southern lawn field — an exceptional one — for the event. This is evident from the documents of the naval HMX-1 helicopter squadron.
“I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of it because it was an exceptional event that got a lot of visibility — on the day before the event, the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, who is the deputy commandant of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn field at 17 July seven o'clock in the morning and the event would start at three o'clock in the afternoon. The helicopter would not leave the site until after the lawn field was emptied between six and nine o'clock in the evening.
In addition, the message stated that if a helicopter was delayed to leave the White House, another crew would be needed due to service time constraints.
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by TIME magazine whether a second crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired whether the incident was a violation of the law.
“One of our questions was whether this was a breach of the Hatch Act, and we were told that there was no breach,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” replied the assistant commandant.
Made in America was the official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political nuances.
In the event, the president spoke in favour of the health reform that had been before the Senate at the time, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and the Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their journeys,
But using them only for photos is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled behind the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which featured products made by American workers from all 50 states,” White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train to bring the president to the White House with centimeters accuracy.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a monthly training quota for the crew.
The unit's helicopters were also flown 11 hours that day in non-presidential support missions.
According to the White House, the incident did not entail any additional costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesperson said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 has no record of flights related to Presidential duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico Base to and from the State of Virginia to the White House lasted for a total of an hour.
According to the White House, the operating costs of the helicopter are significantly lower.
“The calculation of the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters said.
The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations.
According to a 2015 RAND study, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
“I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and employing hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is perfectly appropriate to point out...
It is not certain whether Trump was on a helicopter during the event, but at least he sat in the driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said.
Lightning hit Vaasa railway - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger train traffic between Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to a technical failure, says the Railway Transport Centre.

Venezuela's State Prosecutor Calls for Court to Prevent the Appointment of a New Representative Council
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court ruling that would prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the elected council will be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative council was elected for the country, which could, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, a blocking decision has been requested due to electoral fraud suspicions.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges to the position after a British company that organized the Representative Council vote reported that the results have been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the Assembly, and the elected 545-member assembly includes Maduro's son and wife, among others.
In addition to amending the Constitution, the Council of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees constitutional reform as Maduro's way of strengthening its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have declared that they do not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro claims that the new Representative Council is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
The unrest in Venezuela has been going on for months.
Several people have been injured and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela fell into an economic crisis after oil prices dropped.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to protest on Friday, when a new council of representatives is due to begin.
Russian man sentenced to 4 years in prison in United States
On Thursday, the Minneapolis court sentenced 41-year-old Maksim Senah to nearly four years in prison for involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 following a demand from the United States.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to US judicial authorities in February 2016 despite Russian protests, according to the news agency AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud in March of this year, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is deported after a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry criticised Finland harshly after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In a statement, Finland and the United States were criticised for having been arrested in Finland without Russia knowing beforehand.
According to prosecutors, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to catch usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further control internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Department of Justice's Department of Crime, the incident shows that the United States is also able to hunt down cyber criminals working in other countries.
“We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos' third season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so Cali cartel rises to star in Netflix's hit series
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in Narcos' second season, the Netflix series is certainly not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons of the series will be seen. The third season trailer has been released, and it introduces the series' new villains.
In the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trafficking organization.
The organization, led by four godfathers, works — like a Fortune 500 company — except that there is a little more corruption and violence on the part of the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) manages connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York City.
In a recently announced trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peñana, who recruits US and Colombian policemen for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narcos' third season begins on September 1.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional light art work in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (kuavssa) will carry out an exceptional light art work in honour of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris on 16 May next year.
Kola makes a work of light in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work I want to highlight not only the light but also the darkness.
Today, the light pollution of millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I have experienced concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day,” Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated UNESCO headquarters in honour of the celebration.
I feel very privileged to be able to carry out my art again at UNESCO headquarters,” Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The goal of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fight in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a quarrel in Espoo in the Iso Omena shopping centre parking garage on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when the other party accidentally drove in the prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver, driving in the forbidden direction, shrugged at the driver of another car, resulting in his car starting to move, colliding with the batter's car.
He then hit the car that had crashed into the hood.
In a preliminary speech, the man admitted that he caused the damage and that he had done wrong.
Timo Soin’s question mark headlined: “After that came the Flood.”
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post on Thursday, titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs' party of government.
Then came the flood, now everything floats, Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have used the Flood parable.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases left in the books of history -- after us the Flood -- or -- after me the Flood --
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
Elections are only representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN Mission to Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim director of the United Nations Relief Mission, said hundreds of women were nominated for the provincial council elections, three women sought to be vice president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters were women.
“The role of women cannot be overemphasized,” Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's provincial council and presidential election will be held on April 5, 2017.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international troops are transitioning to an advisory role.
This year’s election is the first time that power has been transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

A flood of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The rage of locals is particularly directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it “eat and flee” tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and the crowds rush through the sights.
Venice is choked by fast day trips to the city by tourists.
The narrow streets are difficult to move around and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center while homes have been replaced by hotels.
The problems of tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist numbers.
They call the current phenomenon poor quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, the time is given two or three hours.
You follow the guide that holds the flag from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and you turn back, says Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini, the prevailing and problematic tourism.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in Venice.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark’s Church.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians protested against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives residents away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be only tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who was organising the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as ships bring to Venice the income it desperately needs and create a need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been planned that cruisers would go further from the historical center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the administrative district of Veneto, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide on its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Around 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving around in Kuopio?
Traffic jams of kilometres on the motorway
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi, the lane to the north has had kilometres of congestion from work on Thursday afternoon during the return traffic.
In the area, the coating work on the motorway is carried out, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
For road works, there is a 50 km/h speed limit instead of the usual 120 km/h speed.
Even in the 50 km restricted area, however, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoon, practically at a walking pace.
On Thursday afternoon, the road works proceeded on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi on the statue of Revelation, or golden deer.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the curses of public opinion.
Amalie Iuel has released stunning images of herself in the Grand Canyon.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has emerged as a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in a 400-metre run in March by twisting the track at the time of the 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400-metre fence run at the time of the Norwegian record of 55.38.
Soon after his record, Iuel, a diligent social media user, discovered that fame and publicity have their downsides.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their genital organs to Iuel, apparently in the hope that the young runner lady would become interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
“I got a lot of wild photos from unknown people, so I had to turn my account into a private one,” Iuel told VG.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of images he received.
I guess you can guess, Iuel laughed.
It’s nice to get feedback after a run, but I get along well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was two years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia first, then to Pakistan.
Then there was Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains with three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally interact with the athlete, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres of fence run.
The leg injury brought snowboarder Janne Korve to the risk of his entire career - now in the World Cup:
It has been nice to count when nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
Last summer, the career was still at stake.
The strain injury on the footboard had forced Korve onto the operating table in January, and the leg did not want to be healed.
The hand had also been hit in the racer.
In the summer, I didn’t know what to do, whether or not to keep going.
Sponsorship deals were interrupted and a lot of things were open,” Korpi says.
But that’s what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg improved, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back to the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it when I first went to the snow.
Damn, this is so much fun, let’s go a couple more times.
Korpi was able to count properly only in September-October, but after a long fall break, just training painless has been a big deal.
There have been only a few races toured.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of boarding for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you’re in a fever that week.
I can’t think that way, Korpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don’t like him when it comes to boarding, he’s always lit up about racing in a tough club.
According to Korvi, the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation have increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose the X-Games of Norway to be held at the same time.
These are important competitions, the visibility is big.
However, I always think that appreciation depends on what kind of circumstances and what level the competition has.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's pits, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at the time when everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It will bring a new flow to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on the sidelines, but otherwise I don't, there's so much flow in my friends!
In the background of the ferrying career Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Pekka Korve’s son is addicted to race sports: the rider has his own racehorses for whom he makes training programs.
When I travel all the time, I don’t have time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the race results and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korve, race steering and race coaching are a potential career plan when the boarding career comes to an end.
I don’t want to go that far, but it’s a likely option.
I feel like I’m studying it along with snowboarding.
I'm trying to stay on the nerves of time and develop, maybe in the summer I'll be driving something.
If it’s my future career, then it’s not hard to start when you’re already in the sport.
Also included are the Elitloppet ravi cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have rented a cruise ship that heads to Stockholm for the Elitloppet race at the end of May.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
We are at a point where there will be no bankruptcy.
There is still a few months to go, we hope to get the ship full,” Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo’s nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-seat nursing home built for Kitee.
The building will be completed next summer on the other side of Terveystie, a neighbour of the health centre.
A common topic of wonder is what customers need for a new treatment unit, because now, during the Siu Wars, many private care homes are in short supply.
Anne Flink from Attendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that in the future, Kitee will have increased demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kanervikola and Eerika from Kite.
The deal was about business, but it is reported that there is a five-year lease on real estate.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand's Scottish factory
The union seeks confirmation from McVitie's inventor's executives of long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the GMB Scotland Department of the General Trade Union of Great Britain, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products has more than 500 employees.
The Pladis company, which owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested more than £5 million in the factory in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives will be the first to be informed if changes are to be made.
In a letter to the factory manager, GMB urges the company to respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of production lines.
GMB trade union Drew Duffy finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not have clear information about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
“Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow, a major employer in the area of high unemployment and poor livelihood.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, Brexit, rising cost of living and continuous reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow urgently needs successful McVitie's production.
According to Pladis' spokesperson, the factory manager had not received a trade union letter until the previous day and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with our employees, among other things, that, like other highly competitive and insecure companies in the market, we continuously evaluate all of our businesses and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness.
In recent years, the company has invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in its production lines and improved operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a production facility, and we are sure to be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are going to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up pursuing Neymar after paying £189 million to close the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record move three years ago?
The sensational move is the most talked-about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for the transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him over £500,000 a week in wages after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be outraged by the activities of the PSG and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source near Barcelona says that the club has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that they were interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned of PSG's best player-seeking clubs.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they want our players, we’ll become their opponents and contact their players,” Al-Khelaif said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they're after our players, they're going to have to face the consequences.
Barcelona seems to have done just that: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Veratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, and it may well be that Barcelona loses its star player, Neymar.

Trump's phone calls were invented by a White House spokesman: \"I wouldn't say it was a lie.\"
The White House admits that two calls mentioned by US President Donald Trump never happened, according to the New York Times.
Trump's incensed phone calls with both the President of Mexico and the head of the Scouts' Association have proved to be invented.
White House spokesman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
He said Trump wasn’t lying.
Sanders said many of the Scout leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump had discussed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just on the phone, but face to face,” Sanders said.
Speech to the Scouts sparked disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the president of Mexico called him and praised Trump for his successful efforts to eradicate illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will ever cross the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the trip is going to crash on the U.S. border anyway.
The Mexican government issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the call had not taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Trump spoke at a National Scout Organization meeting in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scout leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Scouts' Association announced that it is not aware of the call made by any of its executives to Trump.
Michael Surbaugh’s previous statement, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for Trump’s speech, said he spoke for himself.
Trump's speech at the Scout Organization meeting sparked a lot of confusion as it was exceptionally political in terms of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
