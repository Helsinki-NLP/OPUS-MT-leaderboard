Members of the Welsh Representative Council are afraid to look like fools
Some members of the Council of Representatives are confused by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP, i.e. Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The plan started with the plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Members of the Representative Council, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change may cause them to be ridiculed.
According to a Labour representative, the group is concerned that the name — rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp —
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to a Plaid party spokesman, the majority of the group — not satisfied — has proposed other options.
According to a Conservative Party spokesman, his group takes a name change — with an open mind — but points out that the MWP word is a short verbal leap to the word for fool.
In the Welsh language, the letter w is pronounced in this context similar to the letter u of Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Representative Council, which is currently preparing a legislative amendment to the name change, said: “The final decision on the titles of the members of the Representative Council is, of course, a matter for the members themselves.
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 empowers the Representative Council to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the nomination of the Representative Council as the Welsh Parliament enjoys broad support.
The Commission favored Wales MPs or WMP as the title of member of the Council of Representatives, but the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
The members of the Representative Council apparently propose alternative titles, but lack of consensus may cause a headache to President Elin Jones, who is expected to propose amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments includes other changes to the activities of the Representative Council, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative process, the members of the Council of Representatives may give their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the polls in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province known as Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the North neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU-NATO membership aspirations.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' Watches are Silent as Harlem Churches Live in Difficult Times
“The elderly people I’ve been talking to say there used to be a bar or church in every corner of the street,” Adams said.
- There's no one now.
He said it was understandable to lose bars.
He said that people's interaction has changed.
“Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
With regard to the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not carry as far as the leaders imagine, and sooner or later they will have returned to square one.
He added that churches can be replaced with residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
“Unconditionally, most people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he says, and so they will speed up the day when these churches close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a residential area for blacks - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved away in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by a congregation of blacks under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the merchants of the central trading street 125th Street of Harlem against their opposed hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game -- the watches of the poor--
An expert who played the tower clock game in July called it another name: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first tower clock game played by a black musician in the world. It was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins did not replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex squire involving architects and contractors hired by church lay leaders and, on the other hand, by the Episcopal Diocese.
Sakasti - an administrative body of lay leaders in the parish - wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese -- seeking to roll the cost -- was to the sacast, although the sacast had not participated in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old lobster doll in California
Officials say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and hurt him as the boy dives lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he dived with his friends Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that the boy was just excited to catch the lobster, but then he realized that he was shouting, “I was bitten.”
I was bitten!’
Upon reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: there’s a shark in the water,” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Casablad Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams in department store-style beauty wards with serviced expert advisors.
This is a major move for the £2.8 billion beauty industry in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow despite the deterioration in the sales of fashion and household goods, with larger beauty departments being tried in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, expanding to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets sought to fill shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's says its beauty products range will double to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands like L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific area, just like Boots stores.
In the future, the majority of the products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition of grocery shopping to small one-time purchases in convenience stores forces supermarkets to come up with new lures for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores. The company says this has promoted food sales and made the purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how the proceeds of pharmacies located in supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy follows a acquisition in which Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of the plan to expand the range of luxury skin care products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury's, said: \"We have changed the look and feel of our beauty care departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in employees with special training who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands caters to all needs and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones - After Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left — fresh — when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homeware and accessories brand, Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report Jones was — fresh — at a tense meeting last Tuesday at Jones' business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home supplies and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was bet on doubling Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source: “Truly was Holly’s clearly the most important project.
It was his long-term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everyone in amazement.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlow's head office has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold -
This Morning host is one of Britain’s most confidently profitable stars and, according to experts, his departure can cause a million losses to the company due to product investments, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household items, not to mention the delay in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close for ten years to Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Capp for Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked by M&S's new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity show host for I'm I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night that we would not comment on his business.
Tough talk and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that would be received in the media for his comment, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, as well as his positivity to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be a news anchor.
I didn't give up at all.
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had hailed the first meeting in July as a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, nuclear weapons negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the United States -- a similar reaction -- to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said the United States would continue its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, Trump had a much more optimistic view.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results. Missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom, and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get out 10,000 more into this crowded hall, we’d have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of us.
Indonesia's tsunami and quake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required by international aid was not declared, although about 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had remained homeless.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children form a group traveling to Paluu, it is not certain whether the foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Service, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains woefully unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return was likely to lose lives due to the lack of tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in force.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship ordered to help victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new area of accident.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's spent infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has spent money on improving roads and railways.
However, either administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while the new elections are approaching next year.
The tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion, also add to the pressure of either.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sank a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after painting in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal when his team was in goal loss position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping the shot towards the back post.
The shot floated high across the penalty zone towards the upper right corner.
Eventually, the ball dropped to throw over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play up as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch, and I triggered without thinking too much.
Chelsea led the match at 1-0 after Belgian Eden Hazard painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic no access in the situation, before rolling away near the midfield and spouting to Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic played fast wall pitch in midfield.
Then he released Hazard to the penalty area with a magnificent pass through.
Hazard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool with a shot at Alisson Becker's left leg in the trunk.
Liverpool meets the Champions League in the block stage of Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The Indonesian Disaster Service reported early Sunday that the number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the agency, told a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Friday and raised waves up to six meters high.
Fragments in the collapsed buildings spread widely to the town of Palu, with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. by Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to anyone in Birkenhead near John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police.
A female police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, a woman may have come to the scene of the crime asking about where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim of what happened to them.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was told to tell the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman showed up at the scene.
He repeated, “It’s horrible.”
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two beers in the isolated area, and a third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who were overseeing the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something will be asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 using code 247 on 30 September.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became part of the history of rewriting
The eviction of the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatical puritan supporters destroyed English cultural and religious memorabilia like the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as -- stupidity -- and -- to rewrite history --
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on removing statues would mark the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell neither commanded nor implemented the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
A false Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his previous century-old ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell embodies 19th-century opinions and is a historical proof of a character that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, though perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which in this case, of course, caused the monarchy.
Whether or not a precise description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-17th-century controversy has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell, in turn, is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that distribution.
In addition, his achievements as a government administrator deserve praise and remembrance...
Chinese farmer killed by killer pig
Local media reported that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his surname, Yuan, was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui Square, Guizhou Province. The man's artery had been broken and he was covered in blood, South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The pigherd prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunna province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door to the nearby pig farm was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big boar with blood on his mouth.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound boar had crushed the farmer to death.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said that my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised.
The security camera photo shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the marketers told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others as police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the tori authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked people before, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
A farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer living in Manitoba told CBC News that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and their purpose is not to hurt.
You just have to respect them appropriately, he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rain to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa's wind speed was 38 meters per second, that is, a first-class hurricane, Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast time, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa enters the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northward towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching low pressure will form extensive rain areas southwest of the next few days.
Locally, rainfall between 25 and 100 millimetres causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 millimetres of rainfall per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 50-100 millimetres of rain are expected for certain areas in the south-west, and Arizona in particular.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
As tropical rain threatens, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms produce local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rain to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the region.
Fragmented tropical rain showers begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand over Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations in temperatures can be seen throughout the United States as the Arctic cools down, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large fluctuations in temperature at short distances.
In the central part of the United States, there is an excellent example of major temperature differences on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis, and Des Moines in Iowa.
The lingering heat of summer will again aim to intensify and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, it is expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with a temperature of +26°C from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can reach +26°C on Tuesday, which would be about 4°C warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern United States has good potential for higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Tuesday, more than 20 million watched a broadcast transmitted by six television channels, in which Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of a sex crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as the television companies suspended their broadcasts at a last-minute turn, according to which the FBI conducts a one-week investigation into the allegations on the basis of an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was intoxicated and tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional witness statement stating that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Figures from other channels that posted the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who watch in offices.
Something about the proportions indicates that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators in an American football playoff match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers of all television companies was on the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed how the protesters' screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to a hearing with the Justice Committee on Friday. The moderate Republican backup had previously announced that he was voting for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed straight how he stood for minutes with a look down as the chords flew.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he'll tell the truth to the people?
“You have power when so many women are powerless,” he said.
Flake said his office issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, added that he would have more to say after the committee's consultation.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting on taking Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake became convinced partly by the conversations he had with his friend, Democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of Brexit Politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people criticizing her EU plans for divorce of politicizing, which threatens Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
Next to May's interview, a second interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested the person on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims who played basketball in LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's showdown, where police tell Sims that they lost their glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Waydy during interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his bail amount was set at $350,000.
The coroner for East Baton Rouge municipality published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, the State Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement authorities for their -- diligence and justice enforcement --
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter-long attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball at the LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the match last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was “horrified” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“You’re always afraid of something like this happening,” Wayde said.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
The ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexiko.
On Saturday, the Mexican Center for Disaster Prevention urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater's activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions had been registered during the day.
The center records throttle and vibration several times.
Images were published on social media, covering a thin layer of ash in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometres southwest of the capital since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash before independence vote anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in a clash between protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split vote.
Police arrested a group of masked supporters of independence who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, forming dark clouds of dust on the streets normally filled by tourists.
Over the course of the day, more skirmishes broke out as police officers used their bats to control the sleds.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting — not forgetting, not forgiving — and the latter — living in Spain —
The local press reported that fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained during demonstrations.
The suspense is still on the surface in the pro-independence region one year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal, but which is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was low while those who opposed the resignation boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to follow a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the narrow but vital victory achieved in the regional elections last December, the pace of the Catalan independence parties has slowed this year. Many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or incarcerated awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides sparked the controversy.
The situation is getting worse all the time, he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in custody since the last nine years, announced that he would take part in the European elections next year.
“Being a candidate for a European election is the best way to condemn the collapse and oppression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reportedly repeatedly collided with a house in Londonderry.
The events proceeded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and building were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow may have been fired at the car.
Livingston wins Rangers 1-0 with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured victory
Series-lifter Livingston astounded the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was eventually enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the season's first guest win in the Premiership. Next, it will face next Sunday serial leader Hearts, who will be eight points ahead.
The Rangers will also face Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his undefeated streak in the series to six games, with head coach Holt not yet losing once after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost seats against a visitor with a lack of blade
Holt's team should have led long before his goal, having caused the Rangers serious difficulties with his straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide on the goal front to Craig Halkett's bulldozer, but steered the ball past.
The hosts gave ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate in special situations.
This is the way the important paint came in.
The Rangers caused Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga, from which he was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and complete.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but stated that the home team's defense would hold, and Liam Kelly could not be tested much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow steered the ball past one more special situation in Livingston.
The centralizations that rained into Livingston's penalty area were constantly cleaned out. In addition, a penalty kick was called for in vain for two situations - after Halkett's tackle the changer Glenn Middleton and the ball hit his hand.
Great performance from Livingston - analysis
the BBC Scotlann Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent to every player, continuing through the risers.
The team's playing style and crew have not changed much since it rose back to the highest tier. However, Holt must be credited for the way in which he has strengthened the team upon arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing at leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Wormall on his toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but now remained far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the middle of the league table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of correcting relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of 25,000-headed supporters from meeting in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but still a lot of supporters gathered close to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the attention, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some German Turks greet him as a hero as others slander him as autocratic.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
The biker died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in the southwest part of Deptford near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, with busy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the site of the Saturday accident.
City police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his family.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been steered elsewhere, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin jail: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report six prison guards injured in men's high-security prison unrest.
The unrest began in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 on Sunday British time and continues.
Tornado special police officers have been brought to the scene to calm the unrest, behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesperson said: “HMP Long Lartin prison has sent a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
The warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, riot police were alerted to prison in October due to serious unrest, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (dries can benefit)
Tropical low pressure rarely arrives in Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain flooding during Monday and Tuesday from west Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern Kaifornia and Utah, as well as to the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to proceed directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rains.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in its tweet that only —only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest modeling of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50-100 millimetres of rain. On the Mogollin ridge in Arizona, it can rain up to 150 millimetres in some places.
In other southwestern areas, including the Central Rock Mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are actually available. In some places it can rain up to 100 millimetres.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in a drought-stricken area if there is no risk of heavy rain floods.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains may be beneficial because of the severe drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Department of Dryness, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest class, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. It is still strong at the time, with a wind speed of 135 km/h. It moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm loses its strength when facing cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm strong during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
“We expect 75-150 millimetres from the California Peninsula to the northwest Sonora, and up to 250 millimetres are possible,” Weather.com said.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low-pressure Tuesday morning hours. From there, it continues its journey across Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday late..
“The biggest risks to Rosa or its remains are likely to be associated with very heavy rains on the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Agency said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rains and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in a —stable state.
Police said they had arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
Police are asking anyone who may have video footage stored on their mobile phone about the incident.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced Democratic Party -- meanness and anger --
\"The vote on behalf of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party,\" Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the nefariousness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's charges of sexual harassment that would have occurred decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also testified about his allegations during the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character, and courage on that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with excellent merit in public service,” he told a West Virginia supporter.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning to the fullest, he said.
That's why I'm all around to fight for excellent candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken on the task of resisting and preventing
A senior assistant to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination process is expected to be in the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 dead after a major earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, many wiped out along with the giant waves that struck the shores.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on Friday when waves of up to six metres high hit the beach at dusk. Many washed to death as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunami was caused by 7.5 magnitude-strong earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t immediately escape, leaving them as victims — according to Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB spokesperson Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, but it pulled cars, tree trunks, houses and hit all over the country,” says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial images released by the Disaster Bureau show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water-surrounded mosque.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT issued a statement that the energy released in the massive earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have swelled the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as —wide — and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and that the damage may be greater from Palus 300 km north on a continuous coast, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communications — completely disconnected, and no information has been received from Donggala — is reported by Nugroho.
According to a statement issued by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building fervently shouts warnings about an approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Just minutes later, a water wall strikes the beach, which takes buildings and cars on its way.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Officials say the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities with transport planes, but those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief operations, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodon was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The Donggala staff of the World Vision have reached safety in the town of Palu, where they have been accommodated in tent-cloth shelters in the office's inner courtyard. On their way they passed the stage of destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's really bad.
While aid groups were embarking on their comforting mission, some complained that foreign aid workers would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only begin to flow after the accident area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made.
As the second night descended over Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing entertained the hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian hang gliding team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
The Roa Roa hotel was also trapped by his students, says Mandag.
“As a senior member of the addiction, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon says that he desperately tried to reach the beach festival rivals of Palu with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hamlet community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey mark appeared instead of two blue ones.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves took $26,750 in connection with ATM supplementation at Newport on the Wide
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security worker when he was completing the ATM at Newport on the Levee, a statement from the Newport Police Department said.
The driver of the car had been emptying and replenishing an ATM in the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, behind him ran a man who stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Persons with information about their identities are requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: \"The character who used to be known as Kanye West\"
Ye has been the nickname of 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change is preceded by her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album called Yanghi.
On the show, she replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the show, cancelled her participation -- for emotional reasons --
West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
When discussing the title of the album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, “I think that —ye — is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is — you —
So I'm you, we're all you, and we're all you.
It started with Kanye, which means only one, and ended up in the shorter form of Ye - which merely embodies the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is essentially a reflection of who we are...
He is one of several known rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner, JAY-Z, has also occasionally removed and restored the connecting line and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlateolco Plaza on Saturday, promised never to use an army to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly student support and opening up more free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities drove young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for AI research
The U.S. should double its funding for AI research as China boosts its industry performance, as said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by notifications of artificial intelligence from various parts of the US administration, although the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plans last year: it aims to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book, The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China’s most significant artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he served in Microsoft Research leadership positions and as the head of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee praised past U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organized to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. investigators worked hard to get public funding.
“Academic influences are not exported by China, but by big corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its AI efforts.
“I think AI doctoral candidates should automatically be awarded green cards,” he said.
China’s next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China grants funding to individuals working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations grant money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from industry and the academic world.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed in months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing country's name
The Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the name of the country -- the Republic of North Macedonia -- the name change would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the name of the North neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory, and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
The governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal in June, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the anti-vote campaign raises doubts about whether the voter turnout will reach the required 50 percent limit for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow Macedonia, which has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek membership in both the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in a statement.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of this House have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when eventually 66 per cent of those entitled to vote voted.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way to NATO and EU membership.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and putting chairs in front of the boycotting tents in front of the Skopje Parliament.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not through the kitchen door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, as part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe a large majority will vote for the name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said, yes, the vote is our future.
A poll published on Monday by the political research institute in Macedonia referred to a voter turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - that is, below the required activity.
In a second poll commissioned by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote in favour of the yes option.
For a referendum to succeed, the voter turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the Western-minded government after its rise to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat all Brighton defense with goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player received a pass from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left several others behind on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton watchman Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot to the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero is having problems with his feet.
“We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored in that time...
However, Sterling had already given the sky blues an advantage in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero got the ball in the situation deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the fireplace pole towards Sterling.
The Sky Blue attacker poked the ball into the net just before the end line.
City meets Hoffenheim champions in the league block stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoiler of joy in a game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why force the start lineup?
However, Scherzer, who is always as competitive, hopes to take over the pitching hill in a Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a play-off seam. They have a single win difference for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western series.
Rockies caught at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
“While we don’t have a bet, we can at least get up to the pitching hill knowing that the crowd and the other team’s loony atmosphere here in Denver creates the most demanding competition setting I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take on the challenge?
The Nationals have not yet released their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, playing 34 at the start of his match and pitching on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the batter's nest 300 times, with inning statistics being 220 2/3.
Trump campaign in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
All of our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning to the fullest, and that's why I go around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates,\" he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible, radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They have decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't choose who they hurt or who they have to beat to get to power. That's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them...
He said that the Democrats had taken on the task of resisting and preventing --
And it has been seen in the last four days — he said, calling the Democrats — angry and mean and evil and evil and false —
As he referred to as the longest-acting Democrat of the Senate Justice Committee, Dianne Feinstein, the public responded with loud boos.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
Well, uh, I'm waiting a little -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen --
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion.
I am not really surprised when the Momentum activists of my local party supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I am just the latest Labour representative in the queue, who is told that I am not welcome - just because we say what we think.
Joan Ryan, my parliamentary colleague, was treated the same way only because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
Nottingham East's Labour meeting said on Friday that \"we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive\"
For most of the eight years I have served as a local Labour representative, the Friday-sized party council has been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone, and, more friendly and gentle, politics have long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is suitable for party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I had thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me to turn around and take positions that I otherwise would never have agreed to, whether it was national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a surge of insults on social media, which calls for my choice to be withdrawn, for centrist politics to be abandoned, and I get to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are at least political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sexist and racist insults and never waver.
The normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features of this era's politics.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn insisted that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with each motion of censure or amendment to the election rules, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything would go well.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the omissions of Thatcher's government's single school, I have tried to promote better public services to those who most need them, both as a city councillor and as a minister.
I have never covered my political agenda, not even in the last election.
No one in the constituency of Nottingham East could have been surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in Labour leadership.
But my true message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at block tip
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned a win a day in an entertaining Tennessee's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of 10 that has not lost any matches.
A great defense and more successful risk-taking was ultimately what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
“We have been challenged in our matches and we are still undefeated, so I can be satisfied,” he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, \"All honor to Ayr, they took more risks than we did.\"
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the Scottish captain Roy Hughes's yellow card handed to the Warriors' match allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and succeeded in a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, in a conversion kick, Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out from the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, which Climo succeeded in the conversion kick.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal with a conversion kick after intense pressure.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless CLimo, and Macpherson scored a goal behind Ayr's maul, who left the side-line throw.
Climo managed the conversion kick the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and spurred Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game Series Star Starts in Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named the head of a licensed restaurant company and is also expected to start working in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public registrations, he is registered as Director of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a source for the Scottish Sun newspaper hinted that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
“The sea belongs to us: the landlocked Bolivia is trying to regain access to the Pacific Ocean by legal means.
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
The flagpoles of public buildings fly with a blue flag.
The Navy's bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been tampered with with the slogan: \"Rightfully, the sea belongs to us.
Recovering it is our duty...
In inland Bolivia, the memory of the shoreline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource war is still strong — as is the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia waits for a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of reflection.
“Bolivia has a strong sense of progress, community spirit and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
A number of Bolivians across the country are hopeful of the International Court of Justice ruling on the big screens, hoping that the Hague will be advocated — at the end of decades of intermittent debate — Bolivia’s position on Chile’s obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot to do with next Monday's policy.
“The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close — he assured us in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The United Nations institution of Dutch origin has no power to extradite Chilean territories, and the ICJ has also announced that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision is given only six months after the last positions have been taken suggests that the case — not complicated — is said by Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than fostering Bolivia's intentions.
“The current Bolivian government has hijacked the question of sea connection,” Zárate said.
The rhetoric challenging Morales' dispute has suppressed the rest of Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations afterwards.
Neither country has had an embassy since 1962.
The former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court decision was exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia — an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile — and an opportunity — to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit — she said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of connection to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to understand that it’s time for us to move on from the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States
“North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington,” North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said in a statement.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by heads of state at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to restart deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it is a “faraway dream” to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the Korean War ended declaration would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington will be alert to the adoption of the Declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to abandon the arsenal of weapons, which the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own safety, has received widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large-sized hats, which will soon also be on your nearby street
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you don’t have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 show a selection of special oversized headwear that dazzled the style circles of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations to fashion shows as well.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide featherer, which covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon, wizard hat, and even pineapple —but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask more resembled a diving device, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for a large-scale fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing in the streetscape.
The oversized-sized hats closely follow —La Bomba — a straw hat with half a metre of cylinder, seen from all Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the highly visible impractical hat on social media also spurred another large creation to fashion shows — a straw-made beach bag that is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The burnt orange striped raffic bag with white leather arm straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I suppose I’ll see large-sized hats and beach bags in a street view next summer — the designers have impressed so much that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories —
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for global citizens
The learning outcomes of Scottish private schools have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. The success has been enhanced by individual and communal success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of over 30,000 students, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools SCIS, are located across Scotland, aiming to provide a high level of service to their students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, postgraduate and higher education, as well as for world citizenship.
As an actor in the field of education who can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desired subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language if we want to establish relationships with the people of other countries.
From this year’s latest test results, we find that languages are at the top of the lists in terms of access rates among private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data were collected from 74 schools belonging to SCIS. Based on the data, it was found that among students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but are held in the same rank as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the study programme of private schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of situations where employers had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote the future career development of young people.
The more possible tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future over this lifelong skill, regardless of which career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey commissioned by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent of more than 4,000 UK adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language known by a two-digit figure of 15 percent.
This is why investing in teaching languages is important for today’s children.
In particular, the knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposedly important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always several language options in private schools taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future brings.
In this time period, it cannot be denied that, in an international business environment, languages will continue to be of great importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Today’s languages should indeed be seen as international communication skills.
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes its debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for supporters waiting for LeBron James' first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in a game to be played in San Diego before the season begins.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
\"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48,\" the Walton Lakers official website said.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play the incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for six games to be played in the Lakers before the pass.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need any more pre-matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five election events planned for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote awaits his election to fill the Supreme Court judge's free seat, Trump seeks to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event starts at 7 p.m. on the east coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign online live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to take a stand on the hearing of this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became passionate about charges of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote as much as a week after the FBI investigated the charges.
But the primary goal for a series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in a tight November election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign was commented on by the purpose of these five events the following week -- to wake up volunteers and supporting Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives -- according to Reuters.
“Management of Congress is so essential to his purpose that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during the busy campaign season,” Trump’s anonymous campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today’s venue is at the Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia, where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senator Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
“From Morrisey’s point of view, it’s not a good sign that the president is trying to increase his support for opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows fighting spirit to maintain hope before Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-strengthening power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where is this success force at the moment?
“They had a six-point lead that narrowed down to four, so we take this success force as a touch,” Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in the sails and a lot of what to encourage, like the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, with which they played all day together and received three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior to brick to green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the victory party intensified as his round progressed as he managed in a critical put to level the match to exactly four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putt, who won the 15th match, was followed by a similar scream that gave the impression that he believes the United States team has not yet lost.
“You have to focus really well and take care of your own fight,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the indisputable legends of the Ryder Cup Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but sweet duo has won four out of four without error.
“Moliwood — was the only two who did not make any Bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and receive energy from this boisterous audience, confirms that they are the favorites of Sunday. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no more popular player to secure a possible victory in Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
Talks about Europe’s success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, paired with Alex Noren, who was the hero of the morning four-game.
One Bogi and two double Bogs in the first nine holes dug so deep in the pit that they were not even close to surviving there.
On Sunday, no one will help you get out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-player are fascinating to follow from a close-up point of view of couples’ collaboration: what advice they give or don’t give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team up to now and took a prominent lead before the last day, but this four-game showed that the United States team has a fighting will, although in the United States in particular it has been suspected.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took the 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-games from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning process with two wins from the rapping Tiger Woods, and gained a score balance high to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain two years ago in Hazeltine for losing the win, dominated the poorly played United States team in the morning four-ball, taking the match to position 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four-games, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points for Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also known as Molliwood, were the second two in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
Having first crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball, they then superiorly finished the discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through Saturday's two games, was occasionally very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-ball and four-games, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson to the four-game, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to the southwest.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They obtained a tough 2-1 victory over Jon Rahmi and Ian Poulter in a four-ball, and later a 4-3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-game after losing the first two holes, however.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has risen from a four-point chase station to levels at the start of the doubles, although on the Furyk side the tie is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days being second best, it may be that Sunday counterattack is too much to ask for.
North Korea, by no means, disarms itself without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken significant benevolent measures over the past year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the test site for nuclear tests, and promising that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
“However, we haven’t seen a similar gesture from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will be maintained, so under such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally.
Although Ri reiterated the familiar lamentation that Washington does not accept a step-by-step abdication of nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea for every punctuation, his statement is nevertheless significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. sitting president and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, in a statement, Kim affirmed — the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula — and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to officially end the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pyongyang first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also objected to easing the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The United States is demanding — stripping nuclear weapons first — and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even resisting — the declaration of peace,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our distrust...
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, however, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party demanding disarming were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a dead end.”
Yet Rin's tone of voice was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that directing missiles toward the continental territories of the United States was inevitable after -- bad President -- Trump called Kim a suicide-intentioned -- missile man --
However, this year, Trump praised Kim's courage to approach the surrender of weapons, but stressed that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea gives up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the strengthening of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue to be strong and unfailing until we prove a full, final and confirmed withdrawal of nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting the funding channels for the production of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with Rin of North Korea in connection with the UN General Assembly and also announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described progress as being made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo’s —gangsteric demands — only a few hours later.
North Korea committed to closing the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States is carrying out -- equivalent measures --
According to Pompeo, Kim means — with similar measures — the security guarantees Trump undertook at a meeting in Singapore, and the move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest instruction course
All undergraduate students at Harvard University take part this year in a course designed to increase student rest. The course is a counterattack on the university’s flourishing macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medical science at Harvard University, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing about it now, in my last year of study?’
No one had ever told her about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising — she told him in an interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of medical science at Harvard University and deputy director of health services at the University, says the university ended up organizing the course after they had heard how students suffered severe sleep deficits during the study week.
An hour-long course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with a picture of a dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus getting information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behavior.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know about these issues in exactly the same way that they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking - Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, the all-night study marathons are still a proud subject, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made the sleep deficit a growing problem.
Getting enough quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even an increase in weight, because sleep deprivation causes a condition similar to hunger in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical psychology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave the impetus to all campus students to organize a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all graduate students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to remind them of the time to sleep in addition to waking up in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting — blue light — on the circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga shot won by Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were looking for their first win since February 4-10 against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard now experienced his second defeat during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers remained eight points away from the current leader of the Premier League Hearts.
Menga shot the ball to the goal seven minutes before halftime, and the situation was then leveled with Rangers' falling desire to fight.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and the goal difference above is only Hibernian.
Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game as an object thrown from a gueststand hit the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the line-up where the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semifinals of the Scottish league cup.
Holt continued with the same Liv 11 line-up, where the team took a point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again yielded results when a well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations to his own advantage.
Livingston had the opportunity to score already at two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free path to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide in the backpost.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but in the final third of the game, there was no more confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, at fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had bumped into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombian requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly rejected Lassana Coulibally's bush and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation wasn't just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing for Jacobs' long feed tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly placed the ball on Menga for an easy goal.
During the exchange, Gerrard decided to replace Coulibally and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly's impact on the rapid defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long passes after each other.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his positions at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came from the Rangers' exchange, also called for a penalty shootout after clashing with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Meter
Next up is our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882. John Wilhelm-Hans — Geiger, future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter also became a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film, Coronado Watches, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portray scientists who seem quite like cowboys:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a geiger meter, it's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in minerals.
Evans: Look, now you're really riding...
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention that bears his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method separates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of several cancers.
The experimental vaccine has given promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins of several cancers. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method:
HER2 controls the growth of several types of cancer — Professor Berzofsky explains. —These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancer —
A similar approach —taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was hit by critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show did not go as planned.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a flamboyant style and announcing that he was running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he’s a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Justice Committee. The hearing is related to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's rant was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a fragment of it to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock's intention is to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mistreated for wearing a hat on the back of his head.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I’m marginalized — West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see what it means to be marginalized and say that you’re wearing a Superman cape, because then you can’t control what I do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love...
According to Variety, West's comments sparked boos from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of the present described the situation to the magazine as follows: \"The whole studio went completely silent -
West was selected for the show on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song “I love it” dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUSA organization, who praised her courage on Twitter: “thank you for the threats of brazen violence”
However, Karen Hunter, the head of the discussion program, tweeted that West — is just himself, which is absolutely wonderful —
But I can decide not to support a person (by buying his music or his clothing brand or by supporting this -- the art -- which I think supports and spreads an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us, he added.
Before his appearance on Twitter, the rapper announced that he had changed his name to a person formerly known as Kanye West.
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and subsequently an artist known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant gunner charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
Police said the incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area.
The defendant is expected to stand before a Belgian court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Actress Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wagging hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times' cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that the issue - something has gone wrong - and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a member of the Star Guard of the Game of Thrones, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene on the subject.
“The question of where we’ve gone wrong with masculinity is raising strong feelings in me right now,” he said.
“What men have been taught in the years of their growth that have led to problems now perceptible”
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters in it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, “What is innate and what is learned?”
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time — how can we change this?
There is something really wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the pre- or sequel parts of the Throne Game after the series ends next summer because, as he said, he has had enough of the battlefields and horses —
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best that the Game of Thrones has offered him.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on,” she said.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love played by Harrington in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected citizens.
Health officials say the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Around 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
One year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
It is estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women due to conservative values in the country.
Many cases of disease are caused by inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to resolve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator's information and accuses — of spreading dangerous lies — and conspiracy theories —
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that her employee had released personal information about three Republican Senators on the Wikipedia website about them.
A Democrat from Los Angeles assured that the allegations were spread by “extreme right-wing” commentators and websites.
Lies, lies, and more despicable lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the information published is reported to have been the home addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah State.
An unknown person released the information on Thursday from the U.S. Congress during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that according to Hillin newspaper, messages were published from an IP address attached to Waters' office and by a person belonging to Waters' staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and it’s an absolute lie,” Water said.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, are in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is a completely false and absolute lie...
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“The way he denies this is very hostile,” Fleischer wrote.
It seems that his character is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no need for bravery.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
In this situation, you have to behave calmly and calmly.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters' place in the congressional election, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
Incredible if this is true, he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters stated that he had contacted the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies due to these fraudulent accusations.
We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed - he continued, - and that they are brought to legal responsibility for any and all of the destructive and dangerous actions against my staff members -
Johnny English Strikes Again - Underpowered Rowan Atkinson's Agent Parody
It is a well-established tradition to search for Brexit references in any feature film that is slightly tilted to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit Johnny English and the action comedy series, which originated in 2003 with Johnny English and re-awakened to life with the 2011 sequel — Johnny English — Born Again —
Can language on the cheek of a nation's satire become Britain's new national export success?
So or so, mouty-eyed, rubber-faced and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. His name says above all that it is a comical creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, the stupid secret agent who desperately seeks to spirit around the melting glamour, but appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unhappy musician of the single note at the opening concert in London in 2012.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mysterious world man who left sheer chaos, which Atkinson originally portrayed in the TV commercials of Barclaycard, now forgotten.
The last show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives on a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades bump his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedy come out, but the humor itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because 'serious' film brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
The humor seems aimed at children, and Johnny English's crazy-headed treatment does not seem to me as inventive and sharp-sighted as Atkinson's comedy of Mr. Bean's silent roles.
The starting point is that the UK is in serious trouble every year.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the working agent — which is portrayed as Kevin Eldon's unfortunately small role performance.
This is the last drop for the pompous and inconvenient Prime Minister, who is already up to his ears in the swamp of political disfavor: Emma Thompson does everything she can in the skins of the Teresa May parody figure, but the script just doesn’t offer him enough space.
As intelligence advisers inform him that all spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already moved away from active service must be called in.
Of course, it’s the tuning Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The topic sparks some clever jokes; English keeps School of Rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he again meets his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role, Vicki Pepperdine, seems unable to achieve her rights.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service to confront Ophelia Bhuletova, a fatal supercriminal played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is getting manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough is immediately transformed into a farce: the two disguised as waiters set fire to a fine French restaurant and cause chaos as they secretly seek out Volta's luxury yacht. The attempt to explore Volta's house with the help of virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last blockages of the perpetrators will fade by the end of the scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit like it was made for a child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English films, I’ve come to the same thought before: why can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week with a five-day salary
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the pay would be paid for five days.
The party is reportedly demanding from business leaders that the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution be transferred to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The plan would allow employees to enjoy three days of weekends on the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of ‘fitting’ the party's economic program and its plans to tilt politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source tells the Sunday Times: “The revision of the line was announced before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen in an instant, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits into the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party pledged to support the move to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support from Labour.
The Labour Party spokesperson states: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy, and the party is not considering moving on to such a thing.”
John McDonnell, the finance minister of the shadow government, used the work conference held last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from the faceless dictators and the speculators of companies of general interest.
According to plans by the shadow government finance minister, the current shareholders of water companies would not regain their share as a whole, because the Labour-led government could implement -- reductions -- on the basis of perceived abuses.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to the management of employees.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
An investigation into allegations against FBI judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge. The delay also raises the question of whether the result of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican Senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In an episode of the 60 Minutes program broadcast on Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his South Carolina colleague.
Of course, Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened when the accusations came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous...
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like it's cut in stone.
“I’ve made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it’s bomb-proof,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people he named could confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don’t see what could change...
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held Saturday in New York City, is a music event with a cast that is as impressive as its mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now held for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York Central Park to listen to performers like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aiming to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively working to eradicate poverty.
To qualify for a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or actions — such as volunteer work, send an email to a political decider, or make a call, or perform some other action that spreads awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that there are only 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clictivism’ among others — the idea that the world can be changed by signing an online address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million actions for different goals since 2011.
These actions have encouraged policy makers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements on the basis of which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds made have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executors committed to — helping children develop to their full potential — the group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after activists had sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
“With the help of the British government, donors, governments in different countries, and world citizens like you, we can pass on social injustice and malnutrition to the history of history,” Tracey Ullman, a spokesman for Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British government was also urged to take steps to improve maternal and child nutrition by more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which focuses on combating malnutrition, reaching 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the store’s website is: “Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?”
Global citizen’s answer: “The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman host the New York concert this year, and its star cast includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of Home Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a barrier.
According to Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Minister, quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington can, if necessary, resort to his fleet’s help to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia’s activities in Syria, at the invitation of the legitimate government, are an excuse for a sounding of new energy markets in the region.
“I believe that [Russia’s] reason for being present in the Middle East is to convey energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe,” Zinke said.
According to the administrator, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, by encircling to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the public at the event organized by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that profiles — as the mouthpiece of energy consumers — in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it is one and the same thing.
“The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another — he says, and describes Russia — as the circus number of one trick — whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
Opinions take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to increase the efficiency of LNG exports to Europe and to replace the much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas with it.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to Moscow’s leash.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the capacity of 110 billion cubic meters of the pipeline in use, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's opposition is purely economic, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industrial umbrella, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it very problematic that a third state is involved in our energy supply — Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Confederation of Industrialists, recently said after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully about running for presidential election in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she was carefully considering becoming a presidential candidate after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to move to Washington and fix our faulty administration, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom,” he said.
“After the 6th of November, I will think carefully about running for president.
Warren evaluated President Donald Trump during the event by saying that he is taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been outspoken in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren wrote, \"I guess we need an FBI investigation before we vote.\"
However, according to a poll published Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters do not support this running in 2020.
According to a study by the Department of Political Research at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58% of voters in Massachusetts are not in favor of a senator running for office.
32% voted to stand as a candidate.
More respondents supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 elections raised in the discussions include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin Refers to Her Son's War Traumas at Donald Trump Election
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday and charged with domestic violence.
“From what my own son has to go through when he comes home, I can very well identify with other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers carry,” he told an audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the Donald Trump election.
Palin called the arrest \"a hippopotamus in the living room\" and said his son, like other war veterans, would return home slightly changed, they would return hardened, they would return wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and the Air Force have done for this country...
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and the Columbia Federal District support the lawsuit against the new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking a change to the new policy that has come into force in the United States that asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a friend-of-law letter Friday in Washington, Washington, to support asylum seekers breaking the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been announced in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions suit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy.
He reportedly was assaulted by his partner —and his sons in the violent gang — and was denied asylum by U.S. officials on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with a large proportion of U.S. asylum seekers hailing, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned the 2014 decision by the Board of Appeal of asylum applications that undocumented migrants have been able to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said that the new policy — ignoring state, federal, and international law for decades — ignored
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances specific to the application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle, as stated in the “Friends of Justice” letter.
Prosecutors also argue in a letter that asylum seekers are prevented from accessing the US economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and -bring the necessary additional labour -
In June, prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration issues to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Security is intended for persons fleeing their homeland because of persecution or fear of belonging to a race, religion, nationality, or a particular social class or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11th.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palu, the number of deaths found has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation becomes even more serious.
“The situation is very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her fevery baby in an evacuation center in Palu’s ruined city.
“Ambulances bring in new bodies every minute.
There is very little clean water...
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered stuff, and try to save what remains to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spinal and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, intense aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounts how a ferocious earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I got squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think — Harris tells the Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
I heard my wife screaming for help and then it was quiet.
I don’t know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe...
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of provoking with propaganda announcements.
The U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using an American newspaper as a tool of propaganda. This happens a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper that praises the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid annex to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the 6 November congressional election. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempt to interfere in the U.S. elections mark a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-escalating trade war, in which both parties in turn impose tariffs on the counterparty's export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China's revenge tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were targeted at states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa state says Beijing did damage to the U.S. working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a large exporter of agricultural products to China.
China — is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press — wrote Branstad in a poll published on Sunday at the Des Moines Register.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government will benefit from the American tradition of free speech and the press by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In Beijing street newsstands, however, dissenting opinions are only limited, and real, dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Communist Party of China — he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that — one of the largest newspapers in China did not make an offer to publish — the article he wrote, but does not specify what the magazine is about.
Kavanaugh-fiasco banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republican names stand behind the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and defend him can, according to analysts, cause a counter-reaction, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been in big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to proceed with the vote.
“These things cannot be canceled,” says Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at the University of Syracuse, in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation appeases angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday and they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for MoveOn, a national reform group, said Friday.
Friday morning, protesters sang — November is coming — in protesting the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans of the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, which occurred despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unaffiliated political analyst in an interview.
“People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that’s true.
But it could be even greater, especially among insecure female voters and younger voters in the suburbs, 18-29-year-olds, who often don't vote because they don't like the president.
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court's candidacy, where he made his claims of sexual harassment.
“This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee for NBC News.
“It’s not just about the Committee’s vote or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned, it’s about how Republicans have acted on the issue and how they’ve treated Ford — Guy Cecil, a leader of the Democrat-backed Priorities USA group, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony, with a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony is absolutely or likely to be believed, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake pushes the matter forward, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
In front of the Justice Committee, Ford affidavitly testified Kavanaugh, harassing him intoxicated when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed his genitalia to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet in response to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project in technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's purpose was -- to dominate the world.
“It has to be done now,” he said, referring to his startup.
It's a historic moment.
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own — personal data storage — that is, POD.
It can include contact lists, notebooks, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through information”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some paid developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on Inrupt’s website. This is all available from this week on.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We don't ask for their consent.
In an article published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptin’s mission was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute also after the launch of Inrupt.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of the First World War
The city celebrates the Church of England's only priest awarded the Victoria Cross Medal, who served as a soldier, after 100 years of events.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lt. Col., Reverend Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, due to the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Vann died, however, four days later, the sniper was created without ever learning of the highest British army tribute he had received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is -- impressively symbolic --; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after the feat of his award-winning grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent in a very dense nebula and under heavy field guns and machine guns firing...
Later, he plunged into the front line and, showing the greatest bravery, led the troops to advance before his assaults alone to a field cannon. In the ensuing battle, Vann knocked down three gun battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lt. Col. Vann died of a German sniper created on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s act was — something I could never achieve, something that evokes respect — something like that.
Michael Vann He laid a wreath with his brother Dr James Vann after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra.
Michael Vann says that it is —a great honor to take part in the parade — and added: —a great crowd is remembering the glory of a true hero —
Freestyle fans waited up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament — the TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you’ve been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the entire event.
The event in San Jose featured 13 games, six of which were main-season matches, and the show was scheduled to air live in the UK on Channel 5.
At six in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the show changed to the great dismay of the spectators at Pipsa Pigsu.
Some viewers were not really happy to stay up all night because of the match.
One friend of the mixed martial arts opened up on Twitter describing replacing the match with a children's cartoon - some kind of sick joke -
“According to the law, that content was not appropriate to present at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch it to a children’s program — explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior marketing and communications manager, for the change of the program —
-Pipsa Pig, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said that schedules will be worked on to allow UK viewers to follow events in the future.
“I’m thinking of re-broadcasting, which will probably make the program work,” Coker said.
“However, it’s 6 a.m. there, and we can’t get a show before Sunday for our time, which is Monday for their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their head, messages began to move in one direction and the other, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to correct the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We limit the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, trying to offer our fans more and trying too hard.
This is a sad situation...
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he didn’t notice until he came to high school that not everyone is the same as me.
Daley, who spoke on the Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, said he was talking about gay rights to give ‘hope’ to others.
He also explains how after having a child, winning at the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a permanent host of a long-time radio show, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said that she felt \"less\" than everyone else when she was young, because -- it was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs --
To this day, these feelings, to feel less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed,
He says he wanted to show that he was ‘something’ so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he appears at this year's Commonwealth Games appealing to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells the story of his love for a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met as a surprise in 2013 —
Daley married his own 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
“If you experience so many things at such a young age . . . he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later . . . it is difficult to find another person of the same age who would have experienced similar adversity and adversity,” Daley said.
The couple had a son in June — Robert Ray Black-Daley — as a result of which Daley — the whole perspective — has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal,” he said.
You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 when he was only 40 years old from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic entrance tickets.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore to be in the front row,” Daley said.
I held her hand when her breathing stopped, and only when she had really stopped breathing and she was dead did I finally realize that she was not invulnerable, she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was something I’ve dreamed of all my life — to jump in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There’s no better feeling,” Daley said.
This was also the inspiration for his first song choice on the air — Heather Small’s song —Proud — which evoked feelings already as he was preparing for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson to change bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to petrify significantly to avoid a record round remaining in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays in an event every two years for the record 12th time, moved to a bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the duration of fourball and foursome played on Saturday.
Usually, the American five-time Major tournament winner, at the center of attention, now spent half a day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to capture his punches.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, not even considered one of the most accurate drivers in his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-grown roughy punishes inaccurate punches.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, then in the ninth game of Sunday, there will be the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play along with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to spot the streak of all four wins this week.
If Americans who are four points behind 12 by doubles get a flying start, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
“He perfectly understands the role he played today. He patted me in the back, routinely and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought otherwise, but this is how it went and we came up with a solution like this.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else.
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, though it was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at the expense of people, and he’s a funny guy that everyone likes to be around — he explains.
Younger players must have had fun with him this week, too.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup's extensive lead before the final day's duels can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who survived winning with lime lines just by the measure of his nose and won with the narrowest margin possible141⁄2-131⁄2.
“It reminds itself how we led briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit sparsely,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team’s 5-1 wins both on Friday and yesterday, moving to a 10-15 lead at Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're going to the airport and we're doing everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only for it.
As I’ve always said, I’m focusing on these 12 players who play for us. But we’re aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.
Glad to see how his team's players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: \"I will never lick until I drop in on things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow we will focus on individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It’s great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you’re on the field alone, then the player’s capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be relayed to players — tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now you have to give up a partner who can go to the field alone and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk comes to demand better performance from his players as individuals than they could as partners. The exception to this is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced last day's turnarounds in both directions. He was part of the team that won Brookline before becoming a loser when the European team won -- by the miracle of Medinah --
“I remember every damn word — he answered the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw handed the ranks of his team to the end of the day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We’ve adjusted our composition accordingly and we’re going to put the boys on the field the way we want to, as you know, we’re going to do miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense battle and he confronts Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to meet their European counter-players.
“I put the team’s guys in this order because I think it will carry the whole tournament through,” Bjorn said in a statement.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate in the German Navy should have been introduced in 2014. The ship's purpose is to replace obsolete equipment during the Cold War, but it will be introduced at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, local media reports.
According to a military spokesperson for Die Zeit, the deployment of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-delivery problems have persecuted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are scheduled to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface ships, and stealth technology such as technology to reduce radar reflectivity and the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The ship’s important characteristics include its longer service interval; new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port.
“Continuous delays, however, mean that warships at the forefront of technology, said to improve Germany’s influence in the overseas territories, are already obsolete when they enter service,” Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky F125 frigate ended up in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to deploy the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy will return the ship after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media has talked about essential -- software and hardware failures -- which make the warship unfit for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of Baden-Württemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it appeared that the ship is remarkably overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's possibilities for subsequent upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz, with a capacity of 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the corresponding class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the price tag of the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, when the original price was EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have emerged when the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out that the fleet's usable vessels are running out of time.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He lamented that no frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class could have been deployed to the fleet.
Environmental organization eavesdrops on the hidden life of bats
A new study in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new study is hoped to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide in future conservation measures.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland monitors bats and dwarf bats, as well as eardrums and waterhoppers in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the organization also perform mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequencies of the sounds and the species at any given time are ensured by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and a report are created, in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a picture of the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization’s nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats, and how different species use them.
The data will help in the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
The bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly papers and certain chemicals used in construction materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more useful in catching prey than in the eyes.
Bats use advanced echo tracking technology to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization dedicated to protecting the rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country — and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organization has even established the first and only Scottish protected area for the protection of bats only on the land of the Three Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway area, where eight of Scotland's ten species of bats are found.
David Thompson said the area was ideal for bats.
“Threave suits bats very well,” he says.
“We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization helps us to better understand what bats need to succeed.
He emphasizes the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before refurbishment, as the destruction of one resting place for bats can unintentionally cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the bat protection organization, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, \"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't yet know how their populations will fare.\"
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as “fake news” and says people want to “advertise themselves” using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Lasvega hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid the victim $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as —fake news —
No, no, no, no, no.
What they’ve said today, fake news — a five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine - the player kept smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims they have called, according to the Reuters news agency -- unsuitable reporting of privacy concerns --
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, says the player is demanding compensation — from mental sufferings to the severity of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years —
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan reportedly met at a nightclub and moved to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, reports papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was 99 percent a good guy, but whose -- one percent -- was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of his injuries in the hospital, but later ended up in a settlement because, in his horror of the possibility of revenge, and worried, he was subjected to public humiliation.
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to an agreement to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a $100 million contract.
Brexit: Great Britain would regret it forever - end of car manufacturing
“UK would forever regret if it lost its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit,” Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered it “worryful” that the announcement by Toyota’s UK unit would temporarily suspend production in Burnaston, a factory near Derby, if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays will be visible as job losses if Brexit is ended without a deal.
A factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in the production of our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota’s Burnaston unit.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about exit from the European Union about how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its manufacturing plant in Mini for a month after Brexit is completed.
The main concern concerns the risks involved in the supply chain, as reported by car manufacturers, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and EU, and the cars are manufactured on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Keeping a warehouse that lasts more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is -precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border -
“We need a deal, and we want the best deal possible, which not only means success in the current situation, but it’s an opportunity that we need to take advantage of,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“Not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, we absolutely need to be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far.”
Toyota does not know how long production will be stopped, but warns that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union official at the factory, says among the growing members of the concern: “The jobs lost in my experience will never return.
A government spokesperson said: “We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can — have to be postponed for another week — around Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh due to a grueling fuss, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the possible action the president has taken to prevent justice.
Washington has been rumored for months that Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of firing the president based on the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting is reportedly to have been Rosenstein's resignation from office.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced Thursday.
Trump said he, not preferably, would fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its time coincided with a Senate Justice Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, \"There's no date for this, it could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week due to everything else that the Supreme Court is going on right now.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed.
Some reporters might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than disgust with TV journalists — attention-seeking — but nevertheless stated: — I do not deny the fact that they are observant —
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The President holds more Question Hours than any president before him,” he said, adding more evidence without quoting: “We have checked those numbers.”
“Press conferences will still be held,” Sanders said, “but it is infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.”
We often try to do this and you have seen us do this several times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president showed a possible reason for this when performing uninhibitedly and from time to time strangely to journalists gathered there.
Minister of Health wrote a letter to Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) workers from EU countries regarding fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to Scottish health care workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of applications from EU citizens working with specialised public services - established status.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal distinction.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Christion Abercrombie, supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, has been in emergency surgery since the team had lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reported Tennessee reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on stretchers and taking him to the side for a more detailed assessment.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been cleared of the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that — there is no information on the type/ extent of the injury at this stage — and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays his first season on the team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK. Extra money will be used according to the new plans of the Conservative Party to help the homeless.
The aim of the change is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when they purchase properties in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax is directed at people and companies who do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this will be directed to government action to ease the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee, which will be added to the current stamp tax in addition to the addition of the second home and investment housing increases two years ago, can be up to 3%.
The finance minister expects the increase to generate up to £120 million annually.
An estimated 13 per cent of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the property market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK, especially in its capital, have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign real estate owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for low-cost housing in order to remedy the shameful situation in Britain.
Corbyn has published an eye-catching series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the cessation of productive evictions.
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says: “I said last year that I was going to own the British dream of my term as Prime Minister — that every generation’s life should be better than its predecessor — to restore.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become a far-fetched dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team.
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his -- his ultimate goal -- is to become a Scottish team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scots is excited about the challenge of raising the team that holds the northeast corner of the country back to its feet. The team is currently in third place in the UK Second Division.
Ross moved to the Lights Stadium this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country’s team.
I made the second team and it was there — Ross tells BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
“As a child, I often watched Scottish games at Hampden with my father, and that’s something that’s always pulled me back.
This is the kind of opportunity I'll only take if I succeed as the club's manager.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
A former Alloa Athletic leader says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his famous predecessors in a nameful company. He has previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
“At the moment, I have my own success because I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and capability of the club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League, he says.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably consider myself successful only if I could pilot the team back to the Premier League.”
Ross has only served as manager for three years: first as assistant manager of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats coach group.
He then helped Alloa get up from the fall games of Series Three and raised St Mirren from falling condition to champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his player career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“I was probably at a crossroads with my career — he recalls the time when he took over Alloa.
“I really thought I was better suited to being a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, made fairly well, and got to enjoy some of the relatively big successes.
However, playing can be hard.
Players have to do a lot of things every week.
I’m still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running a team feels like the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for a living. I feel better in my own body than I have ever felt in my adult life.

The heat wave of the summer has given kicks to pubs struggling with Britain’s difficulties, but at the same time has piled up more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains grew by 2.7% during July, but the profits of restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA, said: “Continuous sunny weather and longer English participation in the World Cup meant that July became like June with pub sales 2.8% higher, while for restaurants the month was even worse.
The 1.8% fall in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in the sales of restaurants.
Pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to get out with their drinking in mind.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% during the month, and the sales of food decreased by three per cent -
Paul Newman, an RSM company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, says: “The results continue the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the outside-home food market.
It’s no surprise that the struggle for restaurant chains continues, although the 4.8% annual sales decline is particularly hurting now that the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come to operators focused on worse seam foods, and only time will show if the milder temperatures in August bring the industry a much needed respite.
The combined sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following UK pub, bar and restaurant sales, which compiles and analyses performance data from 47 groups in the industry with a combined turnover of over £9 billion. It is considered a reliable indicator of the industry.
One-fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
One-fifth of children, some up to 11 years old, hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed the existence of the phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns that accounts can be used to share sexually explicit content.
20% of students say they have a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
A fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed the existence of a rapidly growing ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that accounts can be used to publish sexually explicit content.
20% of students said they kept a cleaned ‘main account’ for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager, hoping to be raped, after crashing into a secret site of her 13-year-old daughter.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Rector's Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 held two separate profiles, and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan says: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
From Eilidh Doyle - the voice of athletes - to the Scottish Board of Sportsmen
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-member of the Scottish Sports Board and participates in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete. Chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, describes the name as a fine opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
“Eilidhi is greatly respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government,” Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I look forward to playing my role as an athlete’s horn and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction.”
The four Olympic gold medal winners, an American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres of travel at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time will tell if I will recover and what to do.
This has been exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages...
An ad similar to a cow’s mother shares opinions online
An advertisement similar to dairy cows by nursing mothers of a breast pump company has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer tech manufacturer, has launched a product called the world’s first silent and wearable breast pump, its marketing is accelerated by a language-on-the- cheek and music video-style advertisement that describes the freedom of a new pump for nursing mothers.
Four real-life moms dance in a heinous barn, including the following song: “Yes, I milk myself, but I don’t see the tail — and —if you didn’t notice, they’re not udders, but it’s tits —
The chorus continues: Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies,
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused discussion online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has sparked conflicting reactions in viewers. Many say it spoils the daily ‘horrors’ of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after giving birth, a commentator writes.
Elvie breast pump discreetly fits inside breastfeeding vest (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer commented: “I understand it’s traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies —
The third commentator added: —A completely reality-required advertisement —
I also got the ad from the defenders: one woman admitted that the ad was in her opinion — funny —
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product - read in one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in toilets) and ‘feel like cows’.
The purpose of the ad is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced inconspicuous pumps stuffed into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is discreetly suited to the inside of the breastfeeding vest, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Artistic Director of the Mother advertising agency commented on the controversy: “Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By comparing nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges related to the use of the breast pump to the spotlight, we brought out the incredible sense of freedom brought about by the new pump in an entertaining and identifying way.
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on a catwalk in designer Marta Jakubowski's outfit using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to tent camp at Texas border in silence
The number of migrant children caught has increased sharply despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because, as a result of the harsh rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration, the placement of children in foster families has become more difficult.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and enrollment as foster families may jeopardise their own residence in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints, and that this information would be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified in Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied as foster families for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have a previous criminal record.
“Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are in the country illegally, and most of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to look for these people, Albence says.
In an effort to deal with children’s cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to which in some cases the case must be dealt with in court within one month instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place of the arrest.
Many prefer to appear through videoconference rather than in person in their case before the Court of Justice for the Matters of the Invaders.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to aid will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports published in recent months by reception center employees and the system, the time children spend in captivity affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to lawyers, the concern is particularly pronounced in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child's desperation may go unnoticed due to the large size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without being given enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering from trauma.
Syria orders U.S., France and Turkey occupying forces to leave immediately
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the prime minister's deputy, said that foreign forces were in the country illegally using the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and that -- with them will be acting accordingly --
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed — the war on terror is almost over — in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight the holy battle until the whole of Syria is cleared of both terrorist organizations and illegal foreign troops.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a division of more than 1,000 soldiers to the ground torn by fighting.
On the refugee issue, Moulamem said the circumstances were good for returning and accused — some Western countries — of spreading irrational fears — that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
“We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They're politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of rebels in Idlib has created the opportunity to pursue political debates.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on the territory of three million people by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has - clear time limits - and expressed the wish that military action should be directed at jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra front fighters - which will be eradicated.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government and opposition committee to create a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to -- reviewing the provisions of the current Constitution -- and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be elected for a second term
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, the impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic decision ever made by the presidency.
So far, there have been no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled with CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million with MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best viewing time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: top ratings with 3.5 million viewers as the most important news nights.
“This is a blaze that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand — Neal Baer, chief producer of ABC’s Designed Survivor program, says of a minister who will be president after the attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, “Because he makes me laugh,” Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine what happens in the Roe vs. Wade case, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other, and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet goes beyond the duty of a conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour of an expert panel arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's source data for Fear, the consequences of Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket (according to the Washington Post -- a piece of clothing for arrogance -- and Stormy Daniels President Trump's anatomical unscrupulous descriptions.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the same way I used to.
“What he’s doing feels like a reality TV show because in part it’s about giving the public something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pantage Shop series, about the changing people on Trump’s show and the changing plot twists every day (NFL dispute, praise from Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he had a wonderful sunny day at his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn’t go out because he watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage from a program where Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and this was the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing all those crazy programs and people saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

From the outside, money flows into a tight midterm election campaign
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency has faced real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of congressional districts, two candidates already elected will have to fight for one place.
This newly-restricted Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for Democratic Conor Lamb, who gained his seat from the second constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb is competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The division of territories was remade after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituencies favored Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has launched an economic struggle in the finance departments of the main parties at the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar after the March 18th special election of the Pennsylvania Congressional District, widely monitored in Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by the Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won by 20% in the area.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a fine advantage.
The United States was planning to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from its intentions.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the slight counter-reaction in Washington.
President Trump had a warm-hearted meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the leadership team of the Trump Organization group.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to invite American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, on the basis of tacit policies that Taiwan will no longer be recognized, said Department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American state with a high level of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrators made it clear that the meeting was to proceed and this effectively ended speculations about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some indication of the weight the administration gives to the gathering, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton White House spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under the protection of the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now highly evidenced in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be conducting an investigation into whether Trump's campaign was secretly working with Russia when Russia intervened in the U.S. election.
If the power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back in front of his constituents, and possibly be judged by peers.
There are a lot of ifs in this, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's defeat would be inevitable - no more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable march of democracy either accelerates or delays.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been charred ever since it became known that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the President's potential inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is incorrect.
\"How will we react if the newly demanded FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections, are we voting for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these fires, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the sabbatical candles on that swastika-plated table.
How could this legacy be anything but optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic for Rapid Vienna
The Rangers face Rapid Vienna at their home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier that month, a win over Austrians would give the team a strong position to get into the Europa League G-block.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from reaching the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good match,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Maybe we would have been able to catch the win at the end, but overall the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got up in the second, and we were better.
There will be another important night in the European League on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their results were good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we will be able to give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
I hope we can now press to the fullest, leave the season behind and succeed.
Fear of pension savings takes women's sleep away
Although the study participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had spoken about it to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they had spoken to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, deputy director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk to the professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost determinant.
Involve a financial advisor in the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
The financing options for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-funded insurance, if you can afford it.
Create legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative in place so you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you are not able to take care of them yourself.
Also, remember the small details: imagine that your elderly parents would be on their way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about her medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
“It’s not just for the economy, who’s his doctor?” Martin asks.
What medications are in use?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready...

A victim of about forty years of age was in the Ilfracombe Oxford Grove area of Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
The police describe the attack at about 2:30 a.m. as an act of chance.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to increase.
Since communications to the area are broken, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the area north of Palu, which is closer to the surface centre of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information about Palus and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and tsunami struck during the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala stretches more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the coastal line of the northwest part of Sulawesi Island.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activity of the central province of Sulawesi, and in particular of the coastal region of Donggala, is fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire region and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra along the west coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, on December 26, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people off the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck south of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the Sumatra Mentawai Islands, causing a ten-metre-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the enormous damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska police, Palin, 29, of Alaskan Wasilla, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as preventing and resisting domestic violence report in connection with the arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial and the bail is set at $500, reports KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived at the court on Saturday and replied that he was -- guaranteedly innocent --
Palin is accused of three Class A violations, which means that he can be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a Class B offense that could be sentenced to a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
Palin has not been charged with a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving possession of a weapon under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting his face.
Veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for combining her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications connections are broken and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
On social media, videos from the time of the quake are circulating.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing rare death penalty on NYC suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack that claimed eight lives in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was charged with using a Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway in the south of Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov killed —intentionally — eight of his victims and caused —intentionally — serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges can be punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court prosecuted Saipov on a 22-point basis, including charges of eight murders to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal term in cases related to organized crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required — substantial planning and preparation — prosecutors found and described the way Saipov carried out his actions — terrible, cruel and shameful —
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the New York City Southern District Court passed the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York in a federal case in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed convicted of a conspiracy for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators his actions felt good, police said.
Saipov said he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-page charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defense attorneys, said the defense was - naturally disappointed - the prosecutor's decision.
“In our opinion, the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life without the possibility of being released is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously requested that he not be subject to the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a protest against the Conservatives -- to mobilize the civil army --
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
Conservative lineman Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that Britain — would already be out — if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May confronts the differences between her deeply divided lines as she reconciles with a challenge underscored by the conservatives in favour of staying, joining in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the Chequers compromise proposal on the surface under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
The supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to -shut the Chequers proposal away -
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I stand for Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers proposal.
He expressed his opposition to the EU, stating: “We did not fight world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone denounced the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The fact that the British have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false statement.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and neither are the party members or the activists who are really going out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: “The Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Farage said politicians need to feel pressure if they are going to reverse the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between the people and the political class, he said.
“They’re trying to water Brexit down and we’re here today to tell them we don’t accept it.
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want politicians who are about to reverse Brexit to feel pressure from you...
“We are going to mobilise the army of citizens of this country who gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved “Tories Against Brexit” signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
“These are the people who say they can get IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus, and the smooth border functions for free Irish trade,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering the presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl in a reelection in November, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is thought to be running against Trump in the 2020 election.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters after the start of Trump's season.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the highest place.
Arrest in case of LSU Sims shooting
Louisiana Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that they had arrested a person suspected of Friday shooting that resulted in the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had released a video of a Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got shot in the head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 Sports.
Wayde defended his friend, when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that he had been present, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not make the arrest of the resistance and was taken to East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes' team arrangements played an important role in the race.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost on his own luck in defending his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive with the tail of the crowd, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the depot later in the round and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after taking a little contact and after the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inner line, giving up his defensive position only after his movement of two third turns.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of much of the competition while prolonging the change of tires while aiming for a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkössä.
He eventually came to the pit in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed with the remaining eight laps as Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a true gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has made an exceptional effort to achieve a double win, Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of the malice, malice, and dishonesty of the people.
“The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest,” the president said.
“When we see publications and leaked things and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his reply... did you leak the document - ‘Oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we year...No, we didn't leak — he added a senator blaspheming.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations of Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
“I didn’t hide Professor Ford’s accusations and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his wishes.
But his ban was not acceptable to the president, who commented on the matter at a Saturday’s ceremony: “I tell you that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual harassment and thought the Democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
They have decided to regain power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and meanness, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to gain power and rule, the media reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the loss of Friday's Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the team to the levels before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard leveled for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men who won the underdog Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced for the fourth time during the season after the Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute in 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pitch. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a sleazy opening episode, Sullivan brought home the team back to the game in time 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched the Cown handicap goal in time 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first set break as he scored his second goal at the end of the first round of the night.
The home team assembled their ranks and Bouchard leveled again with a superior goal in time 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to score the first lead goal for Dundee at the end of the second round. He also secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final round.
The Giants, who has now lost four of their last five games, will face their next home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
The pilot died to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake.
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller has become a hero since his death, ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could safely get into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake and the tsunami caused by it hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks test the area, and several people have been trapped in the fallout material in the town of Palu.
Although colleagues escaped for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawa Agung did not leave his office in a wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palu.
He remained in place and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, was safely airborne.
He then jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesperson Yohannes Sirait stated that Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter was prepared from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news breaks our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the number of casualties will increase to thousands because the country's disaster authorities have reported a shortage of connections to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong.
“The death toll is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in rubble and many people have not been reached,” Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves of up to six metres in height have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring assistance and equipment to the area.
The 35-year-old family mother Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help the survivors, but we don’t know what awaits us.
It's already a tragedy, but it could turn out to be even worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: \"I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready, CNN reports?
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Representatives of the airline of a plane that crashed into the Micronesia Pacific Lagoon now say one person is missing, although according to earlier reports, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from a sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people were hospitalized on Saturday and everyone was in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane in waist-deep water for emergency exits.
He said the passenger staff panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors in the repair of a nearby dock were involved in rescue operations by transporting people to shore on a rubber boat before the aircraft sank in a depth of about 30 metres (hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents a timeline for the night she was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used data stored on a mobile phone to gather together movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night the victim died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was against his earlier claims with Chambers the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers' house at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was lying because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on data recorded on the mobile phone, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contacts from his phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense's closing remarks are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise of Great Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nurse sues couple over racist text message
A nurse in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother, in which she complains that she is -- again a black person --
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge with -- blackmail --
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her trouble when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and found out that she was black.
-EIIIII, BACK DARK - Plasco-Flaxman wrote his husband a text message.
However, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice, twice instead of her husband.
After realizing the mistake he had made, Plasco-Flaxman, who was uncomfortable with the New York Post, had fired Maurice, announcing that their previous African-American nanny, who had received their departure passports, had done her job badly and this time had waited for the Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and wants $350 a day for the six-month period for which he was originally hired to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do that,” he told The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple have responded to racist claims saying that the termination of Maurice's employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after offending him.
My wife sent him something he wasn’t meant to say.
He's not a racist.
“We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco said in an interview.
“But would you leave your child in the presence of someone you’ve been unkind to, even by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really -
Plasco compared the challenge to blackmail and said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
Are we going to start chasing someone in such a situation?
It’s not very comfortable, the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still underway, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, embedding their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals Paddington publishers feared that the public would not identify with a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, says of the letter: “It is difficult to live in the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release felt bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington was described as a very important family member and said his father was proud of its success.
“He was a pretty quiet man, and not a boastful guy at all,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child’s accomplishment to him; something you’re proud of, even if it’s not really your own accomplishment.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save his life.
“Nad called all the time and said the situation was really bad that he wasn’t expected to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter would die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, \"I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you...
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart going gradually left his body.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that it was all about to end.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to hold myself together.
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned the loss of his daughter, boarded a plane among other passengers who knew nothing of the trial he was going through.
No one knew, he said.
I kept my head down and the tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved my daughter.
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis' son Tyler fell ill with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a catchy grin.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile would illuminate the whole room...
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt — in darkness —
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he is constantly afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created cards to tell people that there are people you can talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't stay quiet, you have to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother had died.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything like that,” Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in her behavior.
She was right on the ground on Christmas day, and when the kids opened her presents, she didn't take any eye contact or anything like that.
He states that Mark's death was a severe trauma to them, but they still have to survive: \"It breaks up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward...

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as FBI opens investigation
“I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted — an inquiry limited in time and scope — we might be able to achieve some unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would break down into a deadlock caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctant is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans’ success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the Supreme Court of the country will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to lobby them to give his support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit, a vote will be held.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game across and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors falls during Kim's time
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of people who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug cited the South Korean Ministry of Unity and reported that the leaps occurred last year from 1,127 to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in human smugglers’ prices.
Pyongyang has not been publicly commented on.
Most North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often forcibly returns them.
Technologically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea at war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on stagnant negotiations on the burst of nuclear equipment.
This followed a historic meeting in June at which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed in general on an effort to achieve the Korean Peninsula's nuclear non-proliferation.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the suspension of sanctions after the meeting.
“Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances we will in no way unilaterally begin to dismantle our equipment first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \"hysterical\" and said she was temporarily unfit to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, she would be called — hysterical — Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was overwhelmed by his feelings and sometimes almost cried and lost his ability to speak while telling about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic members of the committee, without calling the accusations against himself — a grotesque and deliberate persecution of a person — organized by the Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he is not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed him to be biased towards Democrats.
“I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered when he was asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
“Let’s say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not qualified except for the Supreme Court, including the court in which he’s currently working,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was alarmed by Kavanaugh's possible provisions regarding the health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would repeal certain Supreme Court rulings.
“It is not the right time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we would be expected to say it’s wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It’s a legitimate fire talk with months and years of rage going on, and he can’t keep it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, or what do you think?
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she too was crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a way of telling her partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying: “You may think I’m sad now because I’m crying.
I'm really angry...
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant...
Tears are justified as a route of outburst of rage, although they are generally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in the male-dominated office is when I cried unspoken rage and an older woman - a cold-skinned supervisor I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me from my neck and pulled me into the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they made you feel bad.
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, a very frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision, he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
There were seven candidates and the least was one more.
Someone called it ‘Snow and Seven Dwarfs.’
Since the campaign period was long gone, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his feelings — his gratitude to his supporters, frustration with a system that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work on voters and not on delegates, and his hatred for sexism — that he was unable to speak.
“You could have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
I could have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would probably be hacked into obituary.
‘He was crying.’
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the break-in between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's most important export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded with the same measure each time, most recently imposing five to ten percent tariffs on American imports worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-for-eye style, and it does not appear that the world’s second-largest economic power is falling apart for a moment.
In order for Washington to retreat, one should give up on one's own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the U.S. trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing dependence between countries.
“A quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create conditions that start an economic plunge in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than bystanders have realized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-based research assistant at the Center for New American Security’s think tank.
Syrian foreign minister says country is ready to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid to rebuild the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country would improve.
“The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
Circumstances now allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country from which they had to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic activities they had to take in their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people are still in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would be grateful for helping rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with final points 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held the crown for itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament and he hit his starting punch in the water with a par-3 track 16 hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italian Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of the four players who has received a score of 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
America's Jordan Spieth got out with a result of 5&4 European team's lowest ranked player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, ranked the world's top player, lost with results 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight of Ryder Cup's golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It's a team and I'm glad I could be of help - said moved Garcia after winning the European team.
He transfers the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahmi, who won the US golf legend Tiger Woods in individual competitions played on Sunday.
“I feel immense pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him — 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Odd statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding routes throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, whose game was of high quality throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a failed performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We are regrouping, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we are moving forward.
These 12 guys are awesome and I'm proud to be their captain.
I've got to get my hat up.
We have met our winners...
Red-tide algal bloom situation: concentrations fall in the Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota regions
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the number of algae shows a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algal areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, possibly indicating a decrease in concentrations.
Red-tide algal bloom stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be detected ten miles from the Hillsborough County coast, but there are fewer of them than last week.
Red-tide algal bloom has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, concentrations ranged from low to high on the coasts of Hillsborough County, from background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota County, from background concentration to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and from background concentration to high concentrations in Lee County Bullying Coasts and Collier County, the lengths were low.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
In the last week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
