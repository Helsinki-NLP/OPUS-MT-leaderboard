A nine-year-old boy was found in Texas.
Police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's runaway trip to Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy from West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Centre, the boy has been contacted and has no risk of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening Messages around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the after-story.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo is back in the wild, tore the paint off Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League over the weekend and also continued his manufacturing in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the goal kingship of the Champions League turned at least for a moment to the benefit of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved to the top of all-time goal scorer statistics alone when he shot visitor Shahtar Donetski in the network with two hits from penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when the Barcelona Messi, which was tied up with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian Football League in Serie A from the early season, but in the Champions League's D-block, it began intensely with a 2-1 away victory over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored over ten minutes before the end of Juventus' Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was dulled by the absence of knee-distressed Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's Premier League game, didn't come to the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old wing defender Luke Shaw's guest match lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the ManU kit that attacked the goal so badly that Shaw was likely to have broken the tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests in the 41st minute to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of scoring in the Champions League began with the A-block Paris Saint-Germain.
This was the case of Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who switched Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past the rear corner by Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half for PSG 2-0.
PSG has been ranked among the season's winners.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
The PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional career for the first time with his departure club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow's TsSKA lost in a B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party demands immediate resignation - president makes wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was in full spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred solely in Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech discussed the impact of China on the country’s economy.
Germany and Austria want extra summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to more effectively register in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the table of interior ministers.
Teacher Admits He Shot His Girlfriend During Emergency Call
Shannon Lamb, a university teacher with only a little color, tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his “golden dog” is alive and probably shocked, as well as that the contact details of the deceased woman’s family members can be found on his phone.
Inside the house, police found a handwritten message written on the side of Amy Prentiss’ body and anger: “I’m so sorry that I could cancel this I loved Amy and she’s the only woman I’ve ever loved,” said a letter, which, according to experts, was signed by Lamb.
There was nothing to suggest that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where police believe he shot and killed the teacher of the held history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Police chief Lynn Buford of Delta State University said the university officials heard of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the voice.
Authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive a day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher, however possibly having problems.
The students said they were waiting for her classes.
Police at the place where Prentiss died, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked — great people — with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, as if something had been wrong.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told me he had a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University's remuneration principles meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
University Rector William LaForge said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that -- clearly, there was something in Lamb's mind --
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from campus, police got on his trail when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before being arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, according to Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctoral degree in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who for many years tried to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when she was there, said now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a river bank brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, now having a 19-year-old daughter.
“He’s really upset — O’Steen described his daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen reported that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen said her daughter is making and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
The bartender and occasional entertainment organizer of The Julep Room, a dark bar near Gautier, Mike Shaffer reports that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance to a few audiences.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
Just a happy couple, he said.
We joked and threw things at each other.
They were both pretty clever.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led a first-year student seminary program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, said school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was the president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, a candlestick devotion was held, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster from Pettus Mississippi's Greenville and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to police now saying that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the dealer of toy and baby products says existing permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 paid during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
While there are months to go on holiday, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox makes jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film Back to the Future was a moment of immense professional importance for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” she said in a documentary film called Back in Time.
The film begins and it pops into my mind that I’m just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future film, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: “For me it is undoubtedly the greatest time travel film of all time.
Back in Time is available as a video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN leader says Syria's situation will not be solved with arms
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict - not to be solved armedly - and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said he plans to meet the foreign ministers of five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He deplored the fact that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers — has made the situation impossible to resolve —
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis, as they demonstrated when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label him as a wind quartet.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it is not (yet) successful.
Of the last 11 national polls, ten Donald Trump has been in charge in a two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the property king's nomination opportunities.
Of course, the election period is still at an early stage.
These results do not mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his lead to rising Herman Cain, none of whom got behind any state in the nomination process.
There are also a number of reasons why he should have problems in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and have begun to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support polls suggest that the property king is not just a passing stage:
Trump's popularity figures have made a turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the property king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be -- shocked -- if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of those who are enthusiastic) vs. Trump's 40 percent.
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be “unsatisfied” or “shocked” if Jeb Bush, the government’s favorite Jeb Bush, became a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52% of Republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the president.
According to a Quinnipiac survey last week, in the state of Iowa that organizes the first convention, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has the right personality for the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think his character is not suitable for running for president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Information disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible.
In the last parliamentary term at this time, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters think Trump's campaign is credible.
Even if Republicans were to support another candidacy, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as support against Trump has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win with a big 18-point difference from businessman Trump.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/ NOW poll Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump-supporting voters have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said they could potentially change their candidacy.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompousness drives Latino voters further from the Republican Party and harms rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so will Donald Trump.
Frustration in the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely because of their position outside politics.
Six in ten Republicans said in a Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey from Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans have become frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are —unsatisfied — and 21% —really angry —
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn meets David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises up to ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs carefully guarded his performance.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more facts for this weekly show.
He also said that some of the opportunities could be left to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Labour leader to stand silently during the national anthem during Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has sparked criticism among Conservative Party MPs and appeared in several front-page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he -- stood with respect in silence -- and that he acknowledged -- the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War --
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt the Royal House should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
Robin Brant, a BBC policy correspondent, says that the policy differences regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have -- also piled up within the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Smith, the Secretary of Labor and Pensions of the shadow government, stated that the party was —very clear — against only opposing government plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the past decade, when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now tells that he has -- crowded up -- ideas for questions for the Prime Minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, a Member of Parliament for the Islington North region, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Hours is too contrasting and that he intends to refrain from both witty speech and pricking, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has said that the financial secretary of the shadow government, Angela Eagle, serves as her substitute for Question Hours when Corbyn does not attend - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, on the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theater often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Hours, but he later had to admit his failure.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator of the leader's judgement, control of his House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized Question Hours for becoming nothing but a travesty that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people trained as photographers
Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and get a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who graduated from the first project.

The value of the pound rises as the UK's wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped up after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound went above one percent against $1,5505, and 0.84% against €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share on the market and rose by 20 percent after a competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 percent after encouraging news from rival luxury product group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the key market for Burberry - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5 percent after a mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Mondi's shares in the packaging and paper group were among the largest calculators of the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendations from company to company -sell -
JD Sports rose by 3.1 percent after a sportswear company announced its six-month profit before taxes: an 83% increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO says higher salaries could damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase.
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be targeted at the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grass-roots campaign against intrusion into Aldi industry
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trades from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers as well as the first store early next year in South and West Australia, with up to 120 trades coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationship with local food intermediaries and building an IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing as well as through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like Simmo's, an ice cream maker from Dunsborough, offer tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches for their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and West Australia together make up almost 30 percent of the area of Metcash's IGA stores, with higher profit margins than the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcash.
Visitors to shopping in South and West Australia are known to be corner municipalities, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will capture about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million per year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south next year and 30 stores in the west, generating a turnover of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed cost base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit loss before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash loses market share in eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could -- very possibly lose in a decade --
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash board would have contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has declined from 18% to 14%, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food business, which transmits products to about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting a reduction in the debt financing of operations as a result of pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler stands by, and has invested more than $150 million each year in lowering the prices of hundreds of products to the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to renovate stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and introducing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased the appeal, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association.
The younger member of the talented duo Kokkinakis, known as Special Ks, was unwittingly exposed to an incident in which Kyrgios provoked Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifier match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared: “Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat —
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after a cramp ruined his eventual victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another place in doubles games with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“I’m pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into a row,” Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost due to a cramp at the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he's been acting very well, even in rather provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little harshly.
She is very mature to 19 years old, she works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and has never had problems with other players. She is valued in the dressing room, she practices firmly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in important games starting on Friday, describing this -- the joint decision -- as a good solution for everyone, but I still support the return of the Canberra to the team's regular equipment.
“We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in the public eye, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public eye reflecting on these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of damping the influx of incoming immigrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants flocked to neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
The people who fled the violence of their homelands have now set up their tents and settled on an indefinite stretch of road between the checkpoints of two countries.
Frustration, however, grew.
While the police helicopter was standing above them, the immigrants kept saying, “Open the border,” and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's Foreign Minister declared that it is - unacceptable - the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more people arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
“(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels — Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they spoke with hope of reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will be able to act soon.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater power to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed down and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country is also going to erect a barbed wire fence for part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and entry point to the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia as a crime, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
“Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear about this: Crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected military position for next week, but journalists from the Associated Press at the border have been seeing heavy armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban Homeland Security Advisor Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had arrested 45 people as they attempted to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already reached the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now incarcerated by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
Authorities repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after they had sent a traincar covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and the crowds attempted to enter.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they will refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead in a double-digit Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is suing him.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (decreased from 58%), while the second Sanders is supported by 27% (increased from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of Democratic voters say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice, however, more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined with several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is heavily in charge of women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in Democratic voters under the age of 50 has been lost, and she is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly leading with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country’s Democratic voters say they will be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton if she becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
6 percent would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are very likely eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, Republican number one Donald Trump says the same about fewer Republican voters (35%).
When Clinton supporters were asked why they wanted her to be a candidate in an open question, the most popular answer was that she had suitable experience (16 percent). The most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice President influences a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagree.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would choose to second party nominations, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's lead over Sanders will grow. If Biden goes along, the lead will be 20 percentage points, but if she leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has dropped from 78% last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voter has increased.
However, when asked what was most important in the candidate, Democratic voters put opinions ahead of voting.
Also, last month, no Democratic candidacy or potential candidacy was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden best manages the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally agree with Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically.
Looking at all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they don’t have an opinion on Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server use while she was Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that the matter did not affect their general opinion about her.
But it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
People’s opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that the e-mail controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and trustworthy, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of voters say they don’t think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion on him, just like neither does Carson.
The margin of error in the study, which involved 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates collected half of all the votes in the new poll, leaving others to fight for the foothold.
Republican voters throughout the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% in a poll conducted by CBS on Tuesday, before last month's Fox News election debate, to 27 percent.
At the same time, Carson rose from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with various demographic groups and is ousting Trump among the highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen most: from 10 percent last month to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey conducted in September is +/- 6%.
Last week's latest CNN/ORC poll showed Carson was on the rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's popularity rising last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery for nothing, though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said on Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of Baruch College's first-year student
Almost two years after the student died at a fraternity clamming ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun-Michael — Deng during the membership rites in September 2013, and then stalled in taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a backpack of more than 13 pounds full of sand, then repeatedly being tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the goal.
Deng finally complained that his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but the charges said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the brotherhood's national chairman Andy Meng, asking him for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, put the fraternity’s well-being ahead of Michael Deng,” Chief Wagner said.
Deng couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt object blows to the head, body, and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered from fraternity simpus after at least one student has died as a result of it since 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, Deng’s lawyer.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury pleads for first five members to be charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also charged with violent clamoring and criminal intrigue.
“We don’t want to be held accountable only to individuals, and if there is an organisation behind what happened that either officially or informally accepted the situation, they should also be held accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity disbanded their contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the U.S. Central Bank raises interest rates.
The rise in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will collapse, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don’t know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not give much help in terms of timing, especially in terms of the economy.
The arrival of the recession has lasted sometimes only 11 months after the first withdrawal, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. Central Bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the officials of the U.S. Central Bank have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on that, because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the trajectory of the normalization of the situation.
There are actually several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss surrounding the interest rate increase has been oversized.
“The central bank’s first increase after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” said Julian Jessop, Chief Economics Specialist for Global Affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low levels, will be such a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it has no effect.
Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react based on past developments:
As seen in the market in the last about a month, waiting for a raise in interest rates can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
“It appears that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first raise, which in turn may reflect a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent survey of what happens after the central bank raise.
More specifically, over the last about 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14 percent as the increase approaches, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6 percent), and normal status has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll, a leading capital strategy at Nuvee Asset Management, a recent analysis published in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually more pronounced at a later stage of the increase cycle as returns begin to decline.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and which can accelerate the recession.
This is especially true of GDP, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although the figure for the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of whether this time is different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept a raise at this meeting, futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.
“Our study shows that since 1950, all growth cycles have so far been occurring in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has surpassed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun,” the report said.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst during the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest time since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now is the 74th month.
Fixed return has also been unstable as the market is waiting for an increase in interest rates, and the model somewhat resembles the findings made on capital.
The main difference is that as the central bank changes its line, its effects are more visible in bonds than in shares.
The direction of the return on the bonds seems to change immediately for the first increase/cut in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on bonds will drop immediately — Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will lead to convergence of yields for longer- and shorter-term bonds, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although we are still cautious about finding a return, said Kathy Jones, Schwab's solid return analyst, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with a lot of debt are doing worse when the dollar's rise in value makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have funding.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more lucrative in the three months following the first interest rate drawdown,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report directed at customers.
Companies with strong turnover overtaken weak turnover companies after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower-quality enterprises. The average of the former was 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
“Those companies that have a lot of variable interest rates are losing the most,” Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from the rise in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit from higher returns, even though experts disagree on how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the canal of “recognizing”
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor will become increasingly difficult
In addition, he targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only mimic Brit Awards.
Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying it's not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding pressure from the production company to prove that it does something commercial production companies don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel seemed to -- popularize -- its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
“It seems that Radio 3 — I don’t want to use the term — popular — is turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also aimed for the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
“The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only appear to be the Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples of what I remember directly, when in fact you’re just copying something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC president denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first class.
“In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, argued that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the audience, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering that was criticized for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music competition purchased by the BBC from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is neither original nor distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, featuring Star Judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced — in particular BBC style —
He added that he wants the production company — to find success inside his own house — the next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future seasons of The Voice, or order that the licensees' money be spent on other entertainment formats.
Net sales so far rise least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest increase since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that November’s Black Friday could curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown soaring for more than a decade and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling up, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales leveling up, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels in previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as the sofa.
But now it is leveled, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon brought from America has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday of November.
Last year, an average of five times more buyers flocked to their computers to grab shops, knocking down the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five were used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca crane accident, consequences for Bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia partly blames Saudi Binladin Group for collapse
Health Ministry reported that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane collapsed
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, the victims died when a crane collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Mostly white-dressed mourners filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed the holy place, where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family's construction group guilty of disaster, which also injured 394 people.
29 bodies of worshippers killed by cranes in Mecca Grand Mosque were carried across streets
Among the dead was the father of four children Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the Hajj Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
The Arab version of the ruling, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's leaders were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the lifting cranes to fall into the Grand Mosque yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any announcements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The Royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the Grand Mosque of Mecca, which are part of the huge construction heist led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son who was banned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials ordered a million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and to the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European cheap working men are behind popularity
The British are increasingly using helpers’ services, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up hammers and paint brushes and prefer skilled East European workers to do home refurbishment work
It seems that if you’re handy with a hammer or have a swing at painting walls, you’re in the minority today.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to take care of the do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new director of Kingfisher, who owns the home repair chain, said that the popularity is due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store are made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman households that do more home refurbishment work than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the only five women to lead the most important companies in the UK's FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team so that it has equal numbers of male and female superiors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with a group of exactly 50 percent of women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, \"This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the management team.
Kingfisher announced a decrease in both six-month returns and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three ace government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were quickly achieved.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to be forced right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a broad demonstration of employees.
A lot of people think that there is also reason.
Ask them if they want to strike when things go bad.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people online have already announced that they are not going to participate in the protest and are going to work.
In the old age of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet where to protest, but openly declaring himself a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of trade unions, with millions of members, does not give much thought, but it gives cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of movement, values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the drastic decisions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things seem to be rolling at their own pace for years, the union finally gets to the point, that is, to defend the employee’s rights, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to capture the role of the Ay movement, as membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the organisation’s actions, it’s nonsense that Friday’s demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
Hard savings for Lappeenranta University: Aiming to save 8.5 million, personnel reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology starts a cost-saving program with the aim of reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start employee negotiations on the entire staff, with a saving target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, this means the reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, another 2 million will be saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual operating deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by cuts in appropriations made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make approximately 2.6 million deficit-based results.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university’s total budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is ten per cent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research as well as the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant,” says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will begin next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Onnibus wants to go to the Finnish railways
Sir Brian Souter, owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, told Yle that the company also aims at rail traffic in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the shift.
Souter says he has already approached the Department of Transportation.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the plans of the Onnibus are welcomed.
Other international companies have expressed their interest in rail transport, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services elsewhere in Europe.
U.S. Central Bank must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
As Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who still last week believed the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation will not be resolved yet and interest rates will be maintained at the current 0-0.25 percent level.
This is a historic event because the central bank has cut interest rates to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a central central bank has the opportunity to get off zero and start normalizing interest rates — said Angel Ubide, Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought billions of dollars into the balance sheets and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to withdraw, but the signs also indicate that they believe the odds are against the raise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET.
Delta State University shooter leaves apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning - before shooting her colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was -- badly -- about the first murder and hoping -- that he could cancel it -- told authorities Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police reported that Lamb, a geography and social science teacher at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday, he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that police had to send officers to his home.
He said -- he killed his wife last night -- and also mentioned that there is -- a cute dog in the house -- who -- doesn't bother anyone -- but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he did not say it.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss was found, along with a message written by 45-year-old Lamb, which read: “I’m so sorry I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University Rector William LaForge said that there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt to his knowledge, but that -- clearly, there was something in Lamb's mind --
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite Monday's allegations that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no -- no information or evidence -- of any kind -- of trim drama.
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a -- a good person --
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is -- shocked --
O'Steen reported that Prentiss and his daughter were, once and for all, best friends.
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from his home online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
“He always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them he was not going to prison.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car off the road, left it there, and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his doctoral thesis on education in Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a CV found on the university's website.
The stars that lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumors say he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League match.
Although the defender remained in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by the reckless tackle of Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, \"He's got a double fracture on his leg, and he's now in the hospital.\"
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day after that, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible, he comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's in trouble, and then he's playing great, and now this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture will take at least six months, and he won't play in the block stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official erred.
You can judge the situation when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I’m coming back stronger.”
Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw and loses to PSV
The English defender has an additional incentive for recovery at the European Championships next June in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, \"It's a really bad injury.\"
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Dutch at the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this hard because it’s not meant to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent will soon learn something: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long until you almost memorize it.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss's The Lorax book, an environmentalist story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on SuperCamps’ website and continues: “Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we haven’t seen before.”
All of this is true, but the next song in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to the fairly short original text.
“In the town of Necessity within the walls, where all nature is lost and even air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win over the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey’s desire to see the right tree — the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write.
If this isn’t suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds like it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database, which begins with the following: “In a town inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise,” Ted hopes to win over the heart of the girl Audrey of his dreams.
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so inexperienced with the plot of the book. In it, the young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, tree-beating and weaved Kerskanen, ignoring the short, moustache-like creature who gave the story the name Lorax, who —speaks for the trees —
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesperson said the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further on the matter at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England team, but it was still a tough spot
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it involves good tourers and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, only youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral pitches and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth drops out of England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team must understandably be difficult to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged based on their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice until the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not perform quite as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play both at home and in guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He has the cricketer thing we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen has been balled in a batting opening next to Cook, which would get an extra pitcher on the field but would keep four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed guy has already proved to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen did not necessarily do his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference in that.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games as the first grid dropped before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not recall the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, little of what I’ve been dealing with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unblemished statistics - hitting the average 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers on offer and electors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball games, bringing both energy and a relentless fling.
I've always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he's got something to use like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested at one-days, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the selectors do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Britain's exit from the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-assed renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing growing problems day by day, even if one does not take into account even the cordial Jeremy — whether that is yes or no — Corbyn's choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or the anger of the Confederation of Trade Unions for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently explained that because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of the UK's self-centered agenda, which is full of concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they undermine social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister tarry over summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, either with or without a local eye, and then come home saying that they will win supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards at the inside of Britain's EU tent -- \"Don't leave us alone with France -- they say about Berlin -- suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we stay then we leave.
Germany's cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it gets ruined in the same way that it happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a losing force, too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain can have a left-wing government.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing for the Selfie Brits, when their energy would rather be directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that, either, because of their own separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some such ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The re-negotiations had been arranged, and the re-negotiations had nothing to do with Britain.
Europeans have had a bitter experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press's sovereigns are, what they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about — the direct bananas of the EU — while being Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-extinguishers, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally based elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but realized that if you’re in a cage with a lusty gorilla, bananas must be abandoned because of a diversion unless you want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blairish than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron's renegotiation stunt, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thereby giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me in the back kindly at Westminster House of Parliament on Monday (I told him he had no more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-emerging Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, however, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but undoubtedly Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, evolving.
He says he wants us to remain in a renewed Europe.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party, Ukip's goal-to-war passion and the Conservative Party's fiercest nationalists, can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary-Benn, but not a Benn fan — Benn said this on both the radio and on TV this week, when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rugged John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father's father stepped on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's efforts were more attractive.
But the fight for keeping up with - in any situation - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs at a private meeting Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of 24-hour television, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is an acceptable breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic twist on EU membership (and being in line with their Benn-style regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult discussion among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the weak British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health England's E-cigarette Assessment
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting with 12 people, where some had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet, criticizing evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this Milestone Report last month, describing it as a comprehensive review of evidence...
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial that attacked the main conclusion of the PHE — an exceptionally frivolous basis.
Two other researchers who wrote at BMJ have wondered whether the claims - built on rock or sand - are
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.
They say that the public expects that the PHE's claim -- according to the current best estimate, e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes -- is based on a detailed assessment and modeling of evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinion on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced that they had received funding from the manufacturer of e-cigarettes, but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The selection criteria for panel members are not specified, but the panel includes a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that the study received funding from the industry.
Others who were present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco at the PHE.
A study produced by the group — a lot of talk — admits that there is a lack — of uncontroversial evidence regarding the disadvantages of most of the products and most of the criteria — McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that — for now — there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers — are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made at BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of those who burn their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the harm of traditional tobacco - we fulfil our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 leader says
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals — giving anything — should stop doing such hits as this soap opera set on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that license fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not do.
He criticizes the BBC for putting programs of public service, which are likely to have a smaller audience, on difficult broadcast times against the most watched programs of competitors and on channels such as the BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried Channel 4 once for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC will produce and broadcast programs that would be clearly suitable for non-subvented competitors,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of a study on the BBC’s future.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not make and produce.
The Voice is sent to the main broadcast time, because there is a desire to collect as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else is showing the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should finance programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders the other, without doubt implemented inside the house.
To be honest, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
Series entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting audiences — because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support —
He commented on the BBC's most popular series, reminiscent of the comments of former Sky director Tony Ball. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such sets as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience's public service programs — going to the BBC4, where often the number of viewers cannot be measured, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and can then, in defense of £4 billion in licence fees, hypocritically state that 'I guess, we do all these unknown programs that no one watches' —
They put them on a mission site where no one ever comes to see them.
Johnson said to the committee: “I challenge you to find a more regressive system of who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get a lot of value, but I don’t know if that’s true for those people for whom £150 is a big money because they don’t use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 leader David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith-time mission — to inform, educate, and entertain —
He said that only a small portion of BBC production today is classified as education - he said figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the model from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change the task to form -information, education and entertainment -
As for partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he says will only be shown on television by a few, and team up with commercial companies so that all of them can be watched online.
Voice genetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how shuttle worms change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound wave bursts.
Tiny shuttle worms change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse that is too high to be heard by a human ear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified nerve cells with membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease are introduced into the human brain.
Succulamados do not normally react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopically small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4-ion channels, structures found in cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To make ultrasonic controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their neurons have TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on modified worms, micro bubbles strengthened sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turn on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenics may have some advantages over optogenics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along the optical fiber to the desired area within the brain, low frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and the therapeutic virus can make it possible to make the targeted human neurons react momentarily to the ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Ads put Britain's arms trade in shame
Watch the Amnesty International Arms Fair video.
Horrible killer machines!
Footcuffs crushing ankles!
Grape bombs!
And electric stun kits that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and imagery of the comics leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to emphasize the British government's willingness to trade arms for repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre in the London dock area at a party held at Defence and Security Equipment International.

With the separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and metro trains, which required a closer look.
“Important information whether you will travel on the DLR route on September 15-18 - together asked using the London Underground font and brand, with the DLR track turning into a tank image.
In September, a horde of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Cruel Designs).
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the Ad Space Hack Packs. It's a six-pound pack of six-piece keys, which, according to the collective, access one-third of the advertising space for bus stops on the entire planet.
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized - poster vandalism -
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer of the University of Essex, artists increasingly question and want to take political work to outside audiences outside galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on resistance slopes when they realize that they need to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-trade poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty’s video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the past 24 hours via Facebook. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also the graphic designer and background commentator worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Leverin, found that the arms trade fairs were not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar then - and thought, \"Give them the campaign they're trying to avoid -
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertisement for a shady corporation, but it was more stopping to emphasize it with bright colors and animation.
“They have done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair,” Amnesty’s Tom Davies said.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally near our home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when exhibitors trade fantastically embellished products.
Saab revealed in his press release that he received an order from the US Army — the AT4CS RS launched from the shoulder —
This includes a unique tube-to-tube warhead, which exerts excellent effects on the rear of the armor inside the target.
Whatever it does, it is not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
It's been 11 years since, when I was 19 years old, when I didn't know, I moved into a student dorm, and then I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the forced smiles of the people I annoyed, and the many, long complaints of others.
Much of what I have learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything from nervous to totally scary.
It’s tempting to say: tell me where you’re from, whether you like the year off and where, what you think about Corbyn, and why — I don’t really love or hate Marmite because it’s really just yeast extract HAHA I can find in my room —
Take a breath.
And also help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not the ones you wouldn’t want to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were sharing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and public places of entertainment, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Next Next post: Don’t even think about starting a university when you’re in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dorms consist of a culture of room-to-room wandering that is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say — I like you and I want to be a friend with you, but you have to leave now so that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you —
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Knocking when the speech came: knock.
A guy in my student dorm thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you’re starting college in the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people’s doors with a chocolate cake plate and introducing yourself seems to be somewhat less strange, less — welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions — from the 50s.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and it may be that they will connect your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, it depends on whether you can cook.
Badly mixed flour-sugar fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adultly than my roommate who mixed detergent with her milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noise so that people can’t sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot that's ringing the saucepan.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slower because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locked her doors, and set off for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic for your future spouse to move into the same dorm with you?
Or, in reverse, wouldn’t it be incredibly embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if your hot dorm partner isn’t really your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your downside.
In that exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be canceled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling more than twice at most.
Racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kitee - House planned as reception centre was bloated in Salo
A racist attack on Kitee in North Karelia took place at the residence of foreign students on Saturday morning.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer time,” says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at Kitee Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the Folk High School's accommodation facilities were truncated with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through the window of one of the accommodations, police in Eastern Finland said.
According to Luke, who is responsible for the youth guarantee education at the Folk High School, there were approximately ten people in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adult people were free to move, and some of them could be elsewhere,” Luke says.
The public college has accommodated people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time and young asylum seekers who have just arrived.
Everyone in the screwed-up building has a \"A\" status.
Some of them study in adult primary school, some of them in vocational studies and some of them study in Finnish, says Luke.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an act of harm and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, a briefing was held on Monday for the students, which also included the necessary interpreters.
There is no panic and no one wants to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a dozen years, and this is the first time something like this has happened, Luke says.
According to the reader, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
It was suspected that at least three men were involved and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, as this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious, Luke says.
There is also a hospital in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was posted on MTV’s website Tuesday night.
The hospital wall had a swastika drawn and written in English - You are not welcome -
A crime report has been filed with the police.
Attention 15 September at 4:02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karjaa, the passengers in their brittle, - just idiotic -
The Y-train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Rasepori ceases to travel in March.
The news angered passengers entering the early evening shift of the train at Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the downfall strikes the Siuntio people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It’s idiotic because the population is growing all the time and those working need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can only depend on political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that HSTV’s interview video will bring a tractor to the capital.
There are also train changes in the rest of the country.
The H and R trains on the main line are connected to the new R line.
Purola’s position in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be closed throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Siuntiolainen Bengtström believes that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y-train is also used by non-Rabese and Siuntio people, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Espoo-based Annina Pöyry was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further from the city area by train.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to plan their trip again,” he said as he pained on the Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection is likely to arrive on the shoreline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. takes you to Kirkkonummi.
This will increase the costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now starting to explore different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices,” said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the cost.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately one million per year for the Y-train, the ministry of course much more than that.
The R line on the main track misses two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, the number of trains doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Piekssämäki-Valkaus.
Train services are reduced on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million journeys are made per year, while the total number of trips purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring an annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in The Currentity of Capital:
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, former chairman of the SVP, in a book published today, the topicality of Marx's Capital.
He is now taken more seriously than for a long time - Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy increasingly into all walks of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, respected economics expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is topical — now and forever —
However, the former President of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Federation of Finnish Industries is not a Marxist?
No, no, no, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a topical economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
“The usual view is that the history of ideas tells about the wrong opinions of dead men — Korkman begins.
Marx’s predictions went very wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that took too far from the beginning of capitalism.
But Korkman sees value in Marx’s radical attitude.
“The most important thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he said.
Again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological upheaval,” Korkman said.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Marx, however, is well worth studying.
“In the 70s, Marx could not be read,” Korkman said.
\"Maoist and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but more of each other.
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weights of the past years.
“Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx’s mindset, as with other classics,” Korkman said.
UN calls for war criminals to be tried in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the creation of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan Civil War, the news agency AFP said.
The United Nations report on the 1983-2009 civil war came out on Wednesday after a lengthy postponement.
The report blames both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers for war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people were killed in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The number of victims is not exactly known.
In particular, a major offensive by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blamed torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides reportedly committed the murders.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to organize an investigation itself, but will not allow the creation of a UN court because of foreign judges.
The English Yo experiment allowed us to think about social media
On Wednesday, there was a long foreign language, which most of the students had in English.
More than 16,000 students tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language 150-250-word article could be addressed to the administrator of an online magazine advisory column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia lounge chair.
He asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things from the point of view of young people.
There were four subjects in total, one of which had to be chosen.
It was the most difficult of them - to assess the third topic of Porvoo Swedish-language high school English lecturer Mia Lybeck.
The third topic was just a quote from former President of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one was great, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have practiced writing speeches — Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment — pretty normal —
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts such as the adaptation of turbot to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The writings of the autumn will continue on Friday, when there will be another Finnish or Swedish test.
In upper secondary schools, the test is held normally, which means that the demonstration of employees does not affect it.
The Student Qualifications Board invites the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can get to the exam.
You can also get more time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop in Oulu was robbed at gunpoint
On Wednesday morning, a shop in the Clock District was robbed in Oulu.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a face-covering commando.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
Protests against government cuts will block central Helsinki on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations meet at the Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the protest.
In turn, the task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out alert tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant protest is carried out.
Roads leading to the railway square are closed to motor vehicles for about 9.30-14.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west direction from Mannerheimintie onwards.
Are there enough people in the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that it is enough.
I don't take a stand on the police's work-fighting issues.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The police don't tell us the exact number of patrols.
“Something is coming, but we usually manage on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are urging you not to drive private cars in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the centre of the city.
Stable traffic is expected from early morning.
With the arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to the railway station.
Buses are generally far away.
The rest of the trip must then be walked to the protest site, Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From the police point of view, there is a positive side.
The question of the fluency of public transport, which is normally at hand in these big crowds of gatherings, is now partly self-managed.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Finns are sensible and peaceful people, says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday’s protest is in many ways exceptional — remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison point in Finnish political history,” says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Sisiiäinen at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the Ay Movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise hands in front of the government.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough grips are lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the Ay movement is really trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
A mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for the protests on Friday.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration brings about among those who the Ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered in different parts of Finland protested at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday’s protest, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organized in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
The government of Esko Ahon (center) stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and wage-earning organisations had never been as bad as during Aho’s bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the days of October.
Besides, Finland’s most bourgeois government is now in power, says Sisiainen.
The current government coalition is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite what the Finns Party has said.
At the time, there were certain elements of the old working-class movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and potentially closes day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, around 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're on the sidelines.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish Ay Movement have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damage or destruction of property, Sisiainen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration has changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted for three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s Metal and Electric Strikes
The most notable strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a motion from the Conciliation Committee after the strike lasted for seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% raise.
The 1977 electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
October of 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many of whom were unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate their support for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighters strike was one of the longest, if not the longest, national strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were exposed to egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
“Siperia is teaching, the EU is ending,” was one of the slogans.
For Espa, the farmers threw tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and mass redundancies by nurses in 2007.
The threat of disengagement eventually spurred the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors strike in 2001
Doctors on strike - forced to - were the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation investigates the backgrounds of a Finnish truck full of refugees to Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the backgrounds of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck at Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was on its way to Finland.
Everyone on the truck was in good condition.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the site of the incident in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by truck in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by suffocation.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign background, who is about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
The story of five smugglers, a refugee-beating captain, a former drug courier, and a wealthy businessman
A rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a class-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people carry out smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their customers and their book Death Travel Agency will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, present solutions and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
The HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for a summer holiday.
For its location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has done this with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about EUR 8,000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia for him.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until the refugee crisis erupted again.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided so that customers can barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that’s their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with an extinguished lantern.
On the first night we drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes sea travel is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir embarks on a return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he's beating his clients, and at least he says he's beating the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once he was struck by the police, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
“I grabbed customers one by one from the neck and threw them overboard,” Emir said in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is a taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last few, and it has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the city centre, men travelling without their families are staying in tents, lavas and abandoned cars, which now everyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some people also stay in private residences, but it’s a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovaða region, a major human smuggling hub, people are dying tired.
The Gorans are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are the Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their things once and that’s enough,” Goran said.
He said Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly fool all the way.
First, the price is 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people, he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only €50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 300 kilometers, most of the comfortable motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points out the right direction for his customers and shakes off.
In the work of kindness
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, with a large number of Congolese believers, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are being moved from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client first calls one of the Missionary’s five phone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money quietly and float among merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from areas such as the North Kivu War Area, and that they have been forced to flee their homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old ID will be destroyed and another one will be replaced.
It is aided by Missionary contacts with Ugandan police.
The client will then be redirected to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He bills each step separately: submitting an application to Ugandan police costs around 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and moving to a European country, for example, 4 500 to 7 000 euros.
Folios and ice cubes
Tom's a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on duty off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving a freeway A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go directly to prison for organizing illegal immigration.
That's not what Tom wants. He's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a resting place where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom picks the right truck - we have to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example - and cuts off the safety wire on the cover.
It has to be done quietly so that the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client in aluminum foil, a similar thing that is wrapped around a fryer or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should prevent the police heat scanner from detecting the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene hoping that the driver will not rush into the stowaways, at least not before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Uppork, the Turk has been called the master of marketing and the indisputable king of the illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, who dominates maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and continuously developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: Turkish ports are rented yachts supposedly to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships will be loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who will be transported from Istanbul to a port and then to Europe by sea, for a fee of EUR 5 000 to 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must board the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the cover.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as there are no other signs of a crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53,000 from one luxury ship trip after the cost.
He does not do the practical things himself, but hires captains, recruits, guards, hosts, and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organized and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrected 16 September 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton’s new book, which has competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells in his book Fast Girl about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the Games in top condition and ran in qualifying for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
From the very beginning, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership position with a manic run.
150 meters before the target, however, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and was passed by other rivals one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
She also convinced her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's fare was 450 euros per hour.
He said he spent the money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he was looking for the same adrenaline spikes as he had when he competed in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he suffered from bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came to light at the end of 2012 when a article about him was published by Smoking Gun magazine.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was the world's number one at 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but remained the last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster under control:
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of fitness, according to at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Association have been twisting the athlete agreement all summer and autumn, just like last year.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not qualified for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of its contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the upcoming World Cup.
The decision was praised by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union put the ski rooster under control.
“Thank you for pointing the backbone,” Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union,” he said.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug apparently would like to be part of the season for the national team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that also takes care of future generations and does not allow one athlete to solo.
At the same time, he recalled that Northug has been granted financial and other privileges for several years.
I know because I was part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday in which he convinced that he wanted to play in Norwegian colors next season at the World Cup as well as after that at the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, two of which were gold.
He was on the team that won relay gold last winter in Falun.
Paistin translators’ shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On the day of the shields 25.9. there will be stunts in various restaurants and stores, which have been granted a plate of roasters.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-quality food industry expertise and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but that top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the visibility of shield restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in the Old Town participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most significant international events held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: From the establishment of Kauhava reception centre to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the facilities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy in Kauhava’s former garrison.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent critical infrastructure in the region, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Sepillisverkkot Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in preparation for the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
For the past two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed, for example, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint does not concern the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned location in the former garrison area is incorrect.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The administration means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation connected all participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the underlying issues.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges.
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
He is hopeful about the development of the dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able to do so, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
The issue of NATO was also addressed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts closing for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia reports that the aim is to manage the operations of airports during the stoppage by supervisors.

Protest closes streets in central Helsinki
A protest on Friday will close the streets of Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the railway station will be closed to cars around 9:30-14.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, cars are not allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu railway station.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unionkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the shutdown period depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers in a protest all Friday
Metro and tram drivers take part in a demonstration on Friday from the start of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff told STT this evening.
Most of the Beginners close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s protest also causes disruption to Posti’s services.
There are significant delays in the delivery of daily mail, among other things.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross’ blood transports are carried out in spite of the strike.
The aim is also to take care of meal transports as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
You can find information about the services on Posti’s website.
Most of Finland’s Beginners close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Service Trade Union (Pam) has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11:00 and 13:00.
Pam has also called on grocery trade workers to participate in the protest of trade unions.
SOK and Kesko representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep stores open with supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, the possible closure of individual stores is not yet known.
Helsinki Kindergartens partially closed
The Helsinki day care centres will not operate in full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Agency for Early Childhood Education reports.
Due to the protest of trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and the club activities of kindergartens and playgrounds will not be organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for schoolchildren with intellectual disabilities and autism are organised normally.
The Finnish Early Childhood Education Agency promises to inform about the changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels of communication, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time,” Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often a recurring way the Prime Minister’s television and radio talks will become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be delivered on YLE channels in the future.
If other channels register as a channel, then let's see.
We are now using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that the public have television and radio talk.
The subject matter we are talking about here is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That’s why we ended up in this channel,” Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast at 21:05-21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the arena.
Siipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s televised speech will not tell about the more general inward turn of the government.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define a public debate more strictly into your own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? says Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
It reminds me of a recent comment by Secretary of State (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the interests of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these issues are not related.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant with Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media didn't respond.
The style of communication of political decision-makers is not a notification issue in a democracy.
The role of media representatives is, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians into account.
According to Koivusen, televised speech is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there anything more we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the promise, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In this sense, it is a risk, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be stigmatized as a medium of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in accordance with Yle’s interests or the general line.
A clever move from Sipilä
In Sipilä’s upcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say,” the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, we need to look carefully at where Sipilä is missing and what is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, TV talk is a clever move from Sipilä, because this allows him to express his own view without any gravel sounds.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
He bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions can be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on the TV - a drip of sweat, shaking hands.
He compares Sipilä to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If you know how to put it well, it can work.
The situation is different than if the government were to inform one thing, because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly do.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be very exceptional.
He said it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
Workers' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä’s dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide from the endless,\" Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy has been found in Texas.
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy is found and at home, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Finnish National Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fascination of young people: You will cause hatred
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish free fighter, posted a video on Facebook, which specifically appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a weighty speech against youth street fights.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani said he received a message asking to see an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the youth's fad.
Amirchan, 26, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking down, sitting on top of the other and striking without thinking about any of these consequences, as you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people in the video are from an immigrant background.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police, social media has uploaded fighting videos for both immigrants and Finnish youth.
It's just that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make life more difficult for so many other immigrants here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds us.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come to a great deal.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be here for quite a long time.
“That’s a different way of thanking you for being here,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they are ever subjected to racism, you can blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go with someone like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action puts stakes on racism.
You make me hate something I don’t like.
You’re doing pretty bad things, and you’re not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK chairman Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation is considering its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier Wednesday, STTK announced that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Board of Directors will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wage-earning organization SAK to soften its previous position.
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a few comments on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions — to open the labour market lock — and that agreements between active parties are needed instead of forced laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social contract was not acceptable to SAK.
In the past, Sipilä broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: The big demonstration is threatening to fall -- it seems a little funny to put on a fist --
It feels a little funny to put a fist on if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket,” writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospherics vary from one side to the other in the wage camp.
Is the government going to call it off, or is it going to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK federal leaders burst holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
The whole country was threatened.
The threat spread to the Akavas.
Teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK, performed in a conciliatory manner.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap, as demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hastened immediately to announce that his compromise papers are already ready.
At first, there was no room in the office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree when federal leaders just Monday told him to put the country up on Friday.
In the end, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions - to open the labour market lock -
In order to create a common proposal for wage and salary earners, the SAK should be able to accept the five per cent productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola’s STTK has good relations with the Sipilä government.
Palola’s right hand, Jukka Ihanus, STTK’s Director of Social Impact, previously served as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi from the city centre.
Palola said that the government’s expertise in ay has improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola’s exit took a bit of a breeze away from the Finnish stoppers, whose front image is Marko Piirainen (sd) of the ACP.
It feels a little funny to put on a fist if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again\"
Russian Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin criticizes the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Russian Duma spokesman Sergei Naryshkin said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator, a fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, at which Naryshkin made extensive comments about the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced to join the European Union, to come to the meeting - something that the President could remind journalists of.
We believe that it was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to enter the country without difficulty, so Naryshkin continued to prick Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its excellent organisation.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation in Ulan Bator.
The lock meets a real playoff troll: - Paints tight -
Killara and Clave continue the bull days in Hakametsä today when both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual paint festivals in Hakametsä today.
Yesterday, Tappara went to Kuopio to drill for a 3-2 continuum stopover from KalPasta.
The rise was manly, as the silver group of last season was at its worst from a two-goal loss position.
Tuesday night was a lot more fun.
The guest of the Blues, who had recently begun the catch of the Raumans, was round zero points, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti anticipates arrangements on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
In the previous two seasons, the killer has just dropped in the semifinals of the Locke final series.
Both times, the solution has required a decisive seventh match.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three flanks and past.
With the exception of goalkeepers, there are no major changes in group configurations.
The cashiers that both rejected yesterday get a flute shift today.
Mika Norone makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Lock poles.
Point of view: A sad play going on
Toivola, Director of Sports, wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sent a sensational struggle to the heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The unnamed and wooden pot case progressed to everyone's astonishment for the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but persistent underdogs like Rocky.
There were White Indians, Matt of Pori and Pele of the Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the iroquois.
She became a blonde.
The great TV presenter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the won silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer, Toivola, believes that this period’s novelty works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager for Ässie has built a potaka on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The merits of Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than puck-like gaming.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has christened Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no other Rocky in Iron Rock than a nickname.
The Iron Rock philosophy of the game does not include rushing and gimmicking.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's different to play hard than a pig.
Last season Garret Stafford of Ässien tackled Tapparan Jere Karelian on the head.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to the ace hockey, the hot Iron Rock burst after the game to the nation of Satakunta.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are juniors, veterans, cops, and uplifters.
There are practically no key men in the best playing age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skills gap.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season’s events have an impact on procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited,” Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men’s contracts will end in the spring.
Aces balance in the season's three league games has equal number of losses with a goal difference of 1-6.
Hopelan should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen as Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, in the movie I play the mother of my husband's friend.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga plays under Tuuka’s guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna's film \"You Are Beautiful\" is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
The cricket tsems and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my real role model, Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me in the role.
Olga had met Sirka even before the film project, but since then the two have become much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulona would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression and it was really dreary.
There was a rather small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says she had heard a lot about Tuuka’s youth even before film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tukka, known as Heinola's infamous skateboard story.
Olga was an everyday life and a good girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At least he could have secretly fallen for it.
According to Olga, he has collaborated so much with Tuuka over the past 10 years that the big joint project is not scary.
Everything has always been super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot for a month in Heinola.
However, a couple living in Iit is often planning to drive home for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over all of Heinola for a month.
They have received us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became Finland’s most expensive drama film
Timo Vuorensola’s film Iron Sky: The Coming Race has a budget of €17 million.
Filming will begin in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes Finland’s most expensive play of all time with a budget of €17 million.
In the past, the title of Finland’s most expensive film has been in Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation is also set to pass Iron Sky 2, with a budget of over 100 million euros.
Films directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa will begin in October at AED Studios near Antwerp and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I have been sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this movie to the audience,” he told the magazine.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million would be intruded into the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been twisted so tight that there is no slack at all.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday, with an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters’ fronts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or t-shirt sign was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a true fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, the line between funny and trendy is vague: if something is already really junta, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where trendsetters surprised by preferring as boring basic clothes as possible as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Instead of the grey base college, we are now putting on the sweatpants buried at the bottom of the cabinet, where the manufacturer’s logo appears.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas’ recognizable stripe netters, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have also made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s autumn sweaters makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Are you ready to show off the logos in your dress?
Russian politician released proof: I didn’t get stuck in the tank door for hours!
According to claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held to present products from the Russian military industry.
In recent days, the Russian media has reported that the Russian Ministry of State of Emergency had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be peeking at the hatch of an armored vehicle in quite good moods and, at least, based on their images, it’s not about getting stuck or angry.
That's total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, but it was an assault tank BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served at the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace,” Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and I didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
To the Russian military TV channel, Zotov explained that he admired the new technology of Russia in the exhibition, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That’s why I was interested in what’s inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition I will definitely visit all tanks and all assault tanks,” Zotov said.
Zotov also called it the stupidity of a journalist who wrote about it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
“I’m tall and raving, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn’t happen,” he told Russskaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged immaculateness have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people visited the arms show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck originated from a case on Bloknot.ru, in which Zotov was told he was battling out of the tank hatch while trying and eventually threatening to shoot everyone around him unless he got out of his pin.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers gave their own views on what was happening.
Everyone is used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armoured vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours,” said Alexander Pisarevsky, the exhibition coordinator at Bloknot.

The architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candlestick from 1962 looks like it was designed today.
The cubic steel frame is like a work of art, and that’s what it was originally.
The architect brothers are known to have long and mathematically refined the shape of the candlestick.
It was initially presented only to the esteemed guests of the gentlemen's dinner.
Kubus candles are manufactured by family company By Lassen, which maintains the design heritage of renowned brothers.
Candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions of eight, four and one candles, in four different colours.
Kubu is available in black, white, and with nickel and copper.
Candlesticks are topical right now and are suitable for many types of homes.
It has been one of the favorites of interior bloggers lately.

A leak has occurred in the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called rich-shiekka pool into a ditch.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool has a foaming process of neutralizing the enrichment sand and purified process water.
In general, water is pumped either for reuse as process water or, in accordance with the permit, conducted through a surface-draining field into the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material was released into the environment.
The leak was detected in the inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures of the pool.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish Country Report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime allowances and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire agreement system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank’s Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF’s assessment has a lot to say about the government’s actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
This includes, for example, infrastructure investments,” Kuoppamäki says to Talousanom.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects Finland to see 0.4% growth this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects growth to remain zero this year in his new business cycle forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing in the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention has been paid to industrial confidence or other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only about a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The 65-year-old Kimishima’s choice is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata’s footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to bring Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear each year.
According to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, hundreds of minors disappear each year.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Adviser at the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone were made in Finland.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelema says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear from the case that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue handling the case in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were closed because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By September 6, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone.
There are no overall statistics on the number of minor asylum seekers who have disappeared this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well, he stresses.
What about those who have been sentenced to conversion?
Will they also disappear, for example, into the dark labour market?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, says Kannelma.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered applicants.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the EU Home Affairs Ministerial Conference, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, told on Monday about practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of devices
The equipment used by media pioneer Timo T.A. Mikkonen for television and radio productions, who has lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professional equipment in the industry.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows on Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many hobbyists - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from their current Tylmälän home.
We can’t take all the goods with us.
I am slowly starting to inventory and see what things are being disposed of.
That’s what I started with, Nina says.
There is no longer any use for radio and television equipment.
From the recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has made a long career does not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life’s work was archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to get worse than thought: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to extend the force action in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to halt metro and tram traffic only for a demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether the traffic will stop all day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big in the field.
The cuts in the night and innings hurt the drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the supplements raise opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area will virtually stop altogether.
According to VR, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. drive to destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pit.
ACP members will be absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by superior forces, says Pirkko Repo, HSL spokesperson.
Repo says HSL can’t say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Workers’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to get to Europe, according to news agency AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thinks self-made clock is bomb
In the United States, Ahmed Mohamed, a 14-year-old in Texas, has been arrested after the teacher considered the self-made clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to show off the output of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to the juvenile detention cell.
Mohammed has never claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had found the watch to have appeared to be a movie bomb.
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished for three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the American-Islamic Council wonders if the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour Party MPs.
This has offended the people,\" Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial commemorated the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corbyn in its official statement and emphasizes his respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the National Anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Especially among MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, ending austerity measures and increasing public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to perform for the first time today as party leader in parliament during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families,” the Prime Minister tweeted.
The cause of the Minnesota family killing remains unclear - the family's father was waiting for a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating the family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10, and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was their father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns about the absence of children at school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection visit and found Short's family dead in various parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million Houses and a Successful Company
The South Lake Minnetonka police chief, Michael Siitari, is still under investigation.
The motive for the blood work is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million visitors each week.
I have received 50 offers from the company in the last 10 years.
I have rejected all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
Among other things, the success was seen in the fact that in 2011, the Short family bought a staggering house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised as the dream of a car collector in the real estate site Zillow: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
According to StarTribune, however, the family's father was waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offers various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's website, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio was awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented in a good mood on her honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros with his win.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.

And I'll shut up, Lori.
It's an amazing gesture from an NHL star, the biggest donation ever made by an athlete.
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
The hospital said it was the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens.
Subban's donation amount is significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
The players of the Canadiens have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Jean Beliveau, a longtime captain who died a year ago, collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer testing to the hospital.
You can order a wife from a Japanese café for the evening - serves food with bikinis and a fair on.
The theme cafés are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug café and now a wife café on the market.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the grid: attacks against car security began to equip themselves
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to Intel.
The Board consists of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
In the future, the company will update the report based on ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
“We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Intel Security Director Chris Young.
With ASRB, Intel can consolidate safety-related best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been waiting for years like the moon's rising.
At last, the car is starting to be in sight in Finland.
Ford announced RS data now that the car world is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS accelerates with its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100, with a peak speed of 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting in Finland, initially it is estimated to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford said in a statement.
Favourite brand Kia introduced two new features at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than the two innovations in Finland.
The Sportage, created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more circular than before.
A cent has come to the shaft gap and outside dimensions and the car is cutting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the change of the year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty seems to have changed, but this is a completely new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with better driving capabilities, lower noise levels and higher-quality equipment.
Optimos with a 1.7-litre turbo diesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine are available.
Next summer, the pace accelerates with the addition of the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu Returns to Stages in Brave Overall Costume
Singer Chisu is at the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric-blue trousers have a spectacular, open neckline.
The costume beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer star.
The whole is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year hiatus, the singer who became a mother has lost weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to be a year old.
The singer released her first single on a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn’t really bother me.
I miss everything about music, the singer said.
In a few weeks, Chisu will release a new album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the creation of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Surprises Again
Kim Kardashian, a true-to-life actress, gives talks one after another.
She shows off her pregnancy stomach and breastplate freely in sexy clothes, most recently last night at one o'clock in America when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left the job of husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress as the flash lights flash.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonic maternity suit was when he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York only a couple of days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as recent as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnant stomach on the show shift.
The Hard Laws of the Model World: No Home, You Are Lonely, Competition Is Terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls), in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths clean about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season begins with nothing.
Even if in the previous season you were posing in top designer costumes, the new season begins again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces enter the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful.
There is not only one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are always together, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is sad.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own people.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models at the Tory Burch show last night.
Fashion Weeks are currently taking place in New York City, where designers reveal their collections for next year.
Scrooge Salminen plays the most unknown musician in the film Apulanta
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in the film based on the early years of the band Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a big challenge for me, because I’m soon a 26-year-old rapper, and in this film I’m playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Ant before the filming because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it’s good that I’m just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to impersonate people.
A man piloting a completely empty band, Scrooge Salminen and Dogs, does not take on the role.
Punk mangers come with the man naturally.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many of you probably saw a preview, as well as if you’ve ever been to our gigs.
Our appearance has never been anything small, but we always go to the fullest.
From 1993 to 2004, Tuukka Temonen, who directed the bass, directed “Make Us Beautiful” film, was announced today.
The core group, which became familiar to the band's audience, is portrayed to the general public by relatively unknown young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta by Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temos by Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip on his upcoming job as early as last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a photo of his new look on Instagram, which he has had to make for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen in a mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face to smooth cheeks, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Over the past few days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell a child about the situation of refugees who are trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR Crisis Team.
Younger children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can remain in the mind and distress, she says.
However, if a child has come across TV news footage of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth mentioning.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child’s fears can be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the older one thinks he is afraid of.
A child should not be intimidated in vain, even if he is distressed and afraid of himself.
A younger child closely monitors the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees in school, with friends, or online.
Parents should discuss the matter with them if they think about the child.
The fact is that not everyone in the world is doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how our family responds to this.
After all, is the world a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker”
Your power at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
It's hard to control the ball lightning that hits Vermoon
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone Apila’s Ball Salama into a sharp blow in mid-summer.
It only ran for victories and second place until the collapse in Tampere at the end of July.
Since the stallion was thoroughly frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of time for his protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not from the mildest end, but it took two cures to overcome it.
Since Apila’s Pallosalama was forced to exercise light, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE oak in its record time in Turku after Taruntuuli.
Clover's Ball Flash was very pressurized from the break when it had been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
With that in mind, a slight tendency at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that a good competition has struck the stallions.
The horse must have moved forward, and I hope it has stabilized as well.
Clover's ball has been called humor horses.
When it's not funny, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have been disengaged by the lightning rush that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, the competitors can’t handle the ball flash, which even takes off warm-blooded rides.
There is a peseta race in Vermo.
However, the other thing is how the Clover Ball Flash agrees to it.
It’s pretty hard at the time of departure and it might be a swing from under the boom of the starting car and all that.
I hope it's calmer than going down.
While in good condition, Apila’s Pallosalama can also come from the bow, and we start to drive with it for the win, the coach promises.
This is why you can’t get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs.
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple’s iPhones may be removed sometime in the future — but not all of them.
Apple plans to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, according to Tim Cook, CEO of the company.
There are a number of programs on Apple’s iPhone that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Newspaper kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone,” Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the issue, as the company doesn’t want to waste memory space on users’ iPhones.
Eurozone inflation dropped to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, according to Eurostat.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% from a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate of base inflation was 1.0%.
Energy was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the euro area last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the 28 countries in the EU was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in the euro area, i.e. 1.4 per cent, in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest as prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a 2% increase in prices in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the increase will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank forecasting in its new inflation forecasts published in early September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, will again start raising interest rates for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it could start raising interest rates this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit the top at its fastest by next autumn and as a pace of the financial markets before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they used to - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been drawn by Jim Reid, market research strategists at Deutsche Bank London, Nick Burns and Seb Barker, in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategists who prepared the study and report do not think they know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market after that.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or another model as at the time of the previous interest rates - and what may result from that.
It turns out that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a worse position to withstand the rise in interest rates than ever before in the 1950s.
Perhaps not a year from the start of the recession.
Fed's monetary policy and its respective tuning leaders have throughout the summer and early autumn hinted that the time is starting to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first increase in interest rates in more than nine years may be expected this week.
The matter will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed Board’s so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate was in June 2006.
Then ended a series of relatively regular but at a time small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with the Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%, which lasted exactly two years.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of housing financing the most risky in the United States, and a year later, the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, the serious adversities of the financial markets and the real economy started slower than has typically been the case since the previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than ever since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turn of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
On the Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial implications, they explain since the 1950s.
At its fastest rate drawdown, less than a year has passed since the start of the recession, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of Fed's interest rate increases.
The Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its steering rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of different lengths.
Each time has deviated from some of the others, and the narrator is relatively sparse in the review, so it is hardly possible to determine for sure the effects of the subsequent interest rates.
This time, however, the strategy points out that many things are different.
Not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be undisputed even by decades of research.
But three facts about the causes of the crisis and its destructive effects must be somewhat clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, and at the same time grew the next.
2) Over the decades, the amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy, which was already too high, increased even more as a result of central banks’ monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble in the economic history of that time was created.
3) In particular, the crazily cheap debt financing, which was packed almost without restraint in the financial economy, inflated the largest exchange bubbles in the financial markets from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities in the economic history of the time.
Nor does it create a very severe controversy that financial markets, which had risen to an even more complex level, were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates upwards.
The debt leveraged financial structures, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last longer than after interest rates had started to rise and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis, followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give the following reasons:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been crazy cheap as ten years ago, but now debt money is at its cheapest literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not become lighter, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt burden is considerably heavier than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from central banks, which is higher and cheaper than before, has mostly remained in the financial markets and has been the most expensive of the main types of securities and assets, either before the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only do the strategists stalemate with financial market warning signals, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession on the model that has happened in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but similarly, the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next begins to tighten its money supply to a tighter level.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, a Societe Generale strategist, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for a long time coached the Bank’s international investor clients for Fed’s following turnarounds:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for the Fed to rush out to put out financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will focus on sales in November, and HP Inc., which will focus on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, with 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced by 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees will be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating result.
The other year, its three most important customers brought 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System for iPhone After Apple Update Release
To request a new operating system, go to Settings, click General, and then select Software Update.
If the update is complete, the phone gives the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation after a “Software Update Failed” error message appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst rush to pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include deleting apps to get status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests removing apps and then reinstalling them when the update completes.
Make sure the phone is charged or near the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won’t let the update proceed, as if the battery runs out, it could lead to a breakdown of the update.

Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company’s operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company, Saltri II LuxCo, for which Berner was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself said he had filed a resignation notice in May of this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule,” Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the Karelia-Upfloor Board of Directors from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Board of Directors and in the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, the holdings of Kährs in Luxembourg pass through a multi-tier ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted a board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted by a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own task was to ensure that the Finnish family company’s capital was realised.
It is important that we ensure that the profits of Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context,” Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company have no tax planning involved.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Otaniemi, Espoo, the first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is especially the production of healthcare and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the Centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative working life blackmail package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government’s working life blackmail.
The organization also wishes to include other employee central organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is currently in the protest on Friday.
Alternative ways to reduce the cost of work will be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola remarked to reporters during the meeting of the organization's administration.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security provided by the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if the party has a terrible enthusiasm to have a conversation if it's one-to-a-hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication to Parliament on its own package and start preparing for reforms.
Palola did not take a position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the operation of the Sunday supplements is a painful place for the STTK organisation.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would implement some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that an alternative package would be prepared with the SDP that was holding the issue.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime compensation will be halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to the protest, and the aim has not been to organise a strike.
Akava Fjäder
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines with Akava, as Akava has long outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, because without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that Lauri Lyly will lead SAK to prepare the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola’s STTK said earlier Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time, with which it is ready to negotiate a 5% competitive leap sought by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has always been ready to negotiate, and we have been writing an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
We are prepared to see the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks,” says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK has done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model for the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
The same boat, the same coal, the same talokos - - play bingo while Sipilä speaks in the evening
The Green Left of the University of Tampere
Tampere University Green Left's Viva bingo coupon for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä uprising and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle’s channels Wednesday night at 21:05.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, one must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train performers with a televised speech.
Monophony, Monarchy
His speech has sparked criticism and speculation all day long about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that “Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed”
According to the Greens, there has already been a single call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned the monarchy: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for him.
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the SDP, challenged Sipilä’s dialogue: “Soon six months after the election.
No appearances from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is @juhaasipila afraid of?
Public Service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it was commented on live broadcast by SAK President Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
He has been criticized for making a speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote the comprehensive publicity of the whole of Finland, according to Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications, in the news.
Like us in Tammel
The speech has also sparked mockery.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed to their best.
My mom puts on a nicer dress and my dad puts on a tie around her neck.
At 9 a.m., we’ll be quieting down to the TV as we used to in the past when we were in Tammels - writes blogger Saku Timonen.
“In his speech, Prime Minister Sipilä also explains why the Finnish government has millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that it is necessary to cut back when the government has run out of money,” says Pia Lohikoski.
Of what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted a bingo feature on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the common coal, the living of debts and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to disband Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,\" President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan by which al-Assad would, after some time, give way to power elegantly.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russia's ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to arm, the opposition and Assad had to be immediately contacted, and the withdrawal of Assad's power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can discuss it openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I’ll tell him what we have to do,” Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment.
Ahtisaari reports that he forwarded Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisaari says there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several mass killings at that time, and key opposition groups refused all agreements that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches, as his experience has shown that Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's authorization.
If he had told me about what Tshurkin said, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins also said he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to hold power with some of Assad's supporters.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the talks in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own actions.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Asylum seekers’ organisation centre in Tornio
An asylum centre designed by the government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in the city centre in an empty Tornio joint lyseo building.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose a school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-president of the Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he explains to STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the debate.
The organization center was opposed by 13 delegates.
This would make it possible to expect the decision to be positive, he said.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was quickly reacted to.
There are an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is two hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense, says Nousiainen.
The Labour Market Still Wants an Alternative to Extortion
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (in the middle), the halving of holiday money in public would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of work sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä’s opinion, half of the holiday money would be a means of working, because it would target almost all employees, unlike the cuts planned by the government on Sundays, for example.
Labour market organisations could agree on cuts in holiday money, because they have been entered in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will report to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become more and more difficult.
Now's a good time.
It won’t take long for that kind of thing to happen if there is a will,” he said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, changing the Epiphany and Helatorsta into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first sick days will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday allowances reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
Reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation past trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
Because of the actions, the Central Workers' Organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves extension of warehouse in Mahlahall
The Tohmajärvi Council unanimously approved, but slightly murmuring, the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, or sap hall warehouse.
The reason for the criticism was that the project was bigger and more expensive than what was originally discussed.
A busy schedule too.
It was also a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the context of the interim report.
An investment of EUR 150,000 to EUR 200,000 was still on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenues to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays for the investment as rent,” Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
the Karelian language in Joensuu
The city government relaxed its previous steep position to bring street name signs in Karelian languages to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared for the use of Karelian language in information boards and tourism marketing on a case-by-case basis.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a unilingual municipality, it is also worth taking a broad-minded approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be used in a wide range of marketing in the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the province's vitality
Cuts in train connections hit the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region’s business life and competitiveness.
And it also affects whether you can live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raised the issue of air transport, the continuation of which has also been on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the whole province that our chances of success are not reduced by government measures, as is now the case.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport connections on employment, for example,” Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees,” says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siun Sotelle
Joensuu City Board’s view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but one of the gravel voices is also.
Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured), a member of the City Board, presented at the board meeting on Monday that the whole project would be abandoned, but his proposal became unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the City Council, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less than one pair of trains.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains leaves, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money of the Ministry of Transport and Communications for train traffic for the next four-year period will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They will enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped off.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed from the cliff to the roof, who couldn’t get down from the roof on his own.
The situation was born in Torniomäki on the Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to take to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same way, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slid off the scene and the passers-by alerted the rescue department to help pull the ladder to the last one left on the roof safely back to the surface of the earth.
FedEx's operating profit is two-fold, lowers the outlook for the tax year 2016
FedEx reported depressing results in its last quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year earnings forecast, due to the weakened demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects next May to end the tax year with a profit of $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited $10.84, according to FactSet survey.
The lower outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9%, which will come into force on 4 January, and despite higher charges for the land transport of heavy or large parcels that began in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to increase from the previous year because they have cut costs, net sales have increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is performing steadily, taking into account weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.
Plans for salaries for the holiday were announced a day after rival UPS reported that it plans to hire 90 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on August 31, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 percent more than last year.
Profit per share came in at $2.42, which is out of an average forecast of $2.44.
Revenue rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' poll, six analysts waited $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transportation, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s revenue.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the country unit increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and own insurance.
Express unit income was better due to higher base charges, while operating profit in freight operations decreased by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, approximately an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed an 11 percent decline for this year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
U.S. Central Bank officials sit around a huge mahogany table for two days this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the central bank: they must maximise US employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, as to whether the US economy is prepared to be weaned from a record incentive that, until late 2008, has been almost zero in terms of short-term interest rates.
While most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made the central bank officials who are already on guard in advance more fearful as to increasing instability. Fearing what would happen if the federal funds rate reference value was raised by even a quarter of a percentage point.
“Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economics expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for restoring interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the world market is valid enough to wait,” he said.
No agreement has been reached on the decision of the Central Bank, which already causes nervousness in the economy.
According to Bloomberg’s recent study, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
On the other hand, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as a key indicator indicates that growth is only around 30%.
This suggests a decline in the securities market if the central bank does not raise the level if the decision-makers then fail to soften the blow by promising that the next withdrawal will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new number of 16,599.85.
The recovery was brought with it by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level the same this week, says John Lonski, chief financial expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It’s surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now,” he said.
If policymakers raise interest rates, they'll have to put a lot of effort into their policies to support the financial markets so they don't panic.
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets as it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would this month be raising interest rates by a quarter percent, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary situation that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of improvement.
Although inflation is still below the 2% annual target of the central bank, the main reason for this, according to the central bank's decision-makers, is the temporary effect of a significantly lower price of oil.
Ian Shepherdson, chief financial expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a statement: “The economy can cope with even higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight situation in the labour market.
However, the financial markets around the world were shaken last week as China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index dropped as much as 16% of its May record, as investors feared that China would slow down the economy as well as slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when interest rates should be raised.
“Without these financial market events and recent weeks of reporting on China’s economic weakness, policymakers would be tightening levels at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the impact.
“Possible effects on the US economy are still very unclear, and they don’t have much information at their disposal as regards the consequences of the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the president at the time, Ben S. Bernanken, hinted that the central bank could — narrow down — increase the amount of money, caused upheavals in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is more art than science, says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, pointed out this month that —the central bank has previously overreacted to the financial market movement that appears to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy —
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for a raise in interest rates, and Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings, despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth, Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only give priority to economic stability during the Great Crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest-setting committee.
The latest turmoil does not come near its level, Posen says.
“No one wants to be in a situation where there is fear of raising interest rates because the market is getting annoyed,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a twofold demand and does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil’s Child Health Organization in Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the immune system of the child.
Seven channel's Sunrise program is a favorite in ratings, despite Nine's efforts to news the leader revelation on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to announce the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader's revelation failed to increase Today's ratings.
Nine channel's morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts that also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The ballast of the distance did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise had an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting event of all morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning, not just in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The great news on the Seven channel was the 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a rather impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the carrying force of the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
The results of last night gave this a real certainty.
Seven-channel The X Factor program was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838,000) and TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a dual fate the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe gathered 446,000 spectators in the middle.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) reached 623,000 viewers - which was enough to win a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour figure was a staggering 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia's second-night viewer average gives Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce McGuire's number of viewers.

Final trio agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret with whom Sam Wood ends up together in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls do not really slip who got the last rose.
However, when discussing with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, however, they could inadvertently give a clue about the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final
All three women threw themselves poetically in telling how Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, “If Wood’s last rose isn’t for you, who should it go to,” their answers could provide a revelation of who won the bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
“From the moment I walked in the house, the energies and Sam’s energies seemed quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is really down-to-earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize Wood could be -- the real one --
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that obviously this isn’t just a game — I’m now with all my heart in this,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was mysterious.
I don’t know if I can tell, he said.
I like the rest of the girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his impressive open practice day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this proselyte of the Australian rugby league dropped the ball in his first air kick return when the team won Minnesota on Tuesday reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and allowed Hayne to return the next jet kick and included him in the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula's true character was also visible in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a pothole in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
Cam Inman, a specialist editor at the 49ers, reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne Dropped the Jet Kick Captured by Minnesota Vikings in the First Quarter
This was certainly not the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for for the man's NFL debut.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the field after the drop, and later told Australian radio coupler Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
“It’s just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when a pitch in his own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
Overall, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed while police shot rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd protesting against the country's new Constitutional proposal, the official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them were throwing rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was in the last weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At the time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after a devastating April earthquake killed thousands of people.
Legislators have voted this week on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and authorities have said that the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Center NHC says that south of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a cyclone
On the broad low pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands Group, there is a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second closely-restricted low-pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast center added.
Google Starts Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees from Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective as it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being reported by a leader, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her personal experience.
“Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold, and darkness,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are received by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it will contribute the same amount to every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II is mainly caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, ravaged by war.

Weight Loss Surgery May Help Mildly Obese Diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics will live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
“It takes a long time to get the mortality data,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial for the new study in JAMA Surgery.
For weight loss, or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study have been morbidly obese and their BMI has been 35 or more.
The BMI, or weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the BMI is over 30, they are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29 people treated by means other than surgery.
Of those who had surgery, 36 per cent had a complete and 28 per cent had partial improvement in diabetes.
By comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes resolved completely by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and —bad — LDL cholesterol —were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflected blood sugar levels over the long term.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers wrote.
Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at approximately 8%.
This better -- glycemic control -- described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, however, did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study team also compared average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared with the gastric reduction surgery group, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased more than its body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), decreased more than its A1c levels (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7%).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoneix says that although the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer life in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a period of 15 years when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show any improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for those with a BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group — and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease,” he said.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at a time when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously,” he said.
I believe that when a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
Not everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to the violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of the needs of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also insufficient.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime, we’re forced to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems — he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused the chain's violent events.
After 9/11-Isku, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
“I know his motives were good, but he used strength and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the swallowing of the children's hand disinfection agent has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported an increase of nearly 400 percent in swallowing an alcohol-containing hand disinfection agent for children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Information Center.
According to Dr Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgia Poison Information Center, the cases of ingestion of disinfectants in poison data centers in children under the age of 12 increased from 3266 in the case of 2014, 16117.
“Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
She said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap riser.
Reports indicate that teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant smell of disinfectants can attract younger children.
“The child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (handicrafts) are those with added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants can contain any alcohol between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially in small children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few squirts.
“It’s really condensed alcohol,” Dr Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital’s Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn’t leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but the hand disinfection agent is left visible, and if the children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four squirts of strawberry scented hand disinfectant at school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as that of adult drunk driving, according to first aid clinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed while talking and was unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall over and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or alcohol wipes and move disinfectants away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisonings, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York state, three fourth-graders planned to poison their teacher by spreading the bacterial poison into the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and forbade it from his class.
The police consider the plan to be preventable -- an idle nonsense -- and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor: Celtic has no contradictions

Dons increased his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrien Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths downplays talks about contradictions
Rumors have arisen about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately bypassed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
I don’t think we’re under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
Lack of Scottish Championship Tires the Dutch - de Boer
Former Ranger midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said: \"The Netherlands is no longer showing the highlights of Celtic games and why -
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of tension, and also non-Scottish people like to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
But Deila said, \"Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again.
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on January Player Transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January player transfers, he is wary of the recruitment frenzy, asserting that he does not want to confuse the team with consensus.
A former Brentford boss said, \"The transfer window in January is very different from the summer window.\"
For players arriving in the summer, the adjustment time is the entire season preceding, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea attacker Michu, whose name is associated with the transfer window with Celtic, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
A 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and was unable to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight against Scottish Football Federation due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was the third red card to be judged by Collum in the last eight months, which was reversed.
Neilson stands by his message, claiming, \"I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance.\"
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred at a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before Edinburgh's derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was the impulse of the moment,” the attacker added, adding, “Lienee is safe to say I’m not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to play for Celtic.”
Tannade's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly argues that Dundee United's government still has faith in the leadership team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of players must stop.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back together, Donnelly says.
McInnes happy to win at Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, desperately hung along in the game against the Hamilton Accies, but succeeded in Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick to achieve his seventh consecutive league win, which brought them to the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, “There is no team that has won anything, whether it’s a trophy or a league that hasn’t won games in this way.”
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the UK's overall figure increases
EMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164,000 people remained between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 people to a total of 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than in the UK at 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% during the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: “The long-term plan of the government is to build the foundation for a stronger economy”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will see him executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the spectators' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than seats available, the participants are chosen through a terrible lottery.
Oklahoma has reduced seats reserved for the media from 12 to 5.
Whoever chooses, looks at the event as cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also created my own connection with him through calls made over the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist on Twitter accused me of compromising my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants you to get involved.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that —he could have put his words better — but still feels that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what to write, and I won't do it even if he says it.
I have told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be present to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity helps a trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcasts I made on the show.
I am not going to go over all the details again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I am sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
This is the point of view I see him die from.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police chase
Canning Vale's officer remained dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the policemen from his heels went wrong when he found himself in a shallow, muddy water just meters from the policeman who tried — to lure him gently back to the beach —
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday due to unauthorized intrusion.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
But he did not get very far.
“He was standing in the water saying ‘I’m not coming away, come get me’,” said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic:
“Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape,” Elder Sergeant Castledine said.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins buffalo.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that the officials of Racing Victoria attempted to infiltrate his stables last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the editors and Racing Victoria's integrity division of claiming that they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to a treatment measure on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has faced a difficult situation after Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He's been keeping his tongue in check on spy claims for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
“I wasn’t going to say anything about this, and I’ve been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that it all erupts at once,” Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I go home today and sleep well.
I want to keep my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don’t have to be a coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, where he said that the integrity department had been trying to spy on his team.
A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man -- I name him when asked -- and offered him a job in my stables if he cares about what I do there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, of course they should fire their lawyer, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of it at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to non-coachers for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now might make them think that's what they're thinking.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with long-term Lidar cobalt research, and late rejection made him realize that he could -- throw his license over the table --
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of treatment for race day — ridiculous — after a mud or clay bath has been put on the horse’s feet, which is irregular.
It's against the rules of the competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that, he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on it.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
It had it on the day of the race.
Moody may be facing a three-month ban due to the race day funeral treatment, from which the officials began an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobram
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic emergency after colliding with a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after receiving serious injuries when a car collided with him on Murray Valley Highway Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man named Nathalalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, neglecting assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm team coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized the claims of two NRL rugby league champions that his team tackles would be part of the line-up.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to wrestle on their own side when it unexpectedly won the final qualification in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely hide his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualification. Bennett called the game a rugby league -show window - and said that two Queensland teams were not -hardly enthusiastic - about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were just focusing on -- contact -- tackle.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by the criticism of two leading coaches against Storm, as that means they are afraid of losing to the team.
\"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost them 24-2,\" Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year, and in the last six weeks we have only emphasized contact in tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he’s probably not used to losing, and so this was a little shock for him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of exciting rugby by reminding his mentor that Bennett-trained St George Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 championship by playing —boringly —
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He felt it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said there could be nothing less to care about.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That’s the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought that side up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby his style — not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I become more confident when they say such things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a match for important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roosters was more score-rich than the game played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense to break and miss a goal?
For me, this is about the lines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Stormi is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for next Saturday night's pre-final at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale next Tuesday morning.
$200,000 bail for Serb man on drug charge
A man who is threatened by a possible life sentence from a 40-pound cocaine possession attempt smuggled into Queensland has been released against a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 kilos of drug to the Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina all morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened by a potential life-long attempt to hold the amount of cocaine intended for business, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic was trying to hold the entire amount, and that he could be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
He has a strong connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia — he told the court on Wednesday.
In a criminal court case, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
“After reading both people’s affidavits, it’s clear that setting a $200,000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them,” Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted bail on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and holds on to his curfew between the evening and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl while sleeping on her phone and then logged in to the online messaging service, where Hogg received numerous obscene photos of the children sent to her by another user.
The girl later woke up, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She searched her phone and found shocking messages, and immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five images, searched the computers on the scene, and found -- worrying -- web searches with search terms that had been used to search for obscene images taken from children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done this — to attract pedophiles — on the Internet before he — pretended to be a cop to scare them —
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it’s an addiction — that he’s dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had completed the searches on a computer but said that they had been done only because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him photos, as well as about Hogg asking the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that after drinking, he is sick of his head, and wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: “When she found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shook and cried.
Mom saw the obscene photos on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she reported that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, a 23-year-old living on Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking photos of immoral children on June 14 of last year. He broke his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to come to court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the register of sex offenders, as it can be argued that his crime did not include -a significant sexual element -
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that the social worker had time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is under arrest before the trial.
He was added to the register of sex offenders before the date of conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe Addresses Parliament Wrongly
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell to the podium earlier this year on the leading steps.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tarnished by opposition legislators' claims that anonymous death threats had been sent to them, warning them to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with punctuation as he gave a state of the country speech to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
“The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled ‘death’ — Gonese told reporters after Mugabe’s speech.
The message warned the relevant Members that immunity will end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity will not be in force.
The supervisor of group discipline said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is, in his concerns, facing threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business services business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from the faster growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in expenses starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help companies move into a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual revenue will be over $50 billion and will focus on producing unparalleled integrated technology solutions for businesses.
The division breaks down a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has been going through a huge reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that he will be rehabilitated as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next England games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity with this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the start of the season.
“This type of injury does not threaten a career,” Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, as the player tries to return in the middle of the season there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons he has played out of Arsenal's 157 league games in only 65 games.
Looking at Arsenal's wider entity since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons, it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their last season's improvement in injury statistics will continue.
“Sometimes when you return from an injury, you can be prone to a period when you have to strengthen your body and get competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilize, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will be able to make the kind of career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team as Arsenal starts his Champions League game Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the beginning.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to maintain balance and give a breather to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favorite of the F-block, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own - Undefeated - campaign last season.
The stadium was quaked on Tuesday night by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the surrender of the Champions League against Monaco last season, and is still motivated by a distant dream to lead the team to its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate of young men is higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the largest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 secondary school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person’s chance of recovering doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were — in good health —
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of the appearance of potential mental health problems was halved if they had healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style goes past the content and the immediacy of the answer is often more important than the meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, although in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - the personal growth and friendship of inner yearnings - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn’t get any greater happiness.
The fineness of the Friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No character defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: “When listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better —
Often, men who contact us feel that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of getting over is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends are one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While unbiased, my outside position at the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the filming venues have been redesigned to celebrate the party, why not take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship means.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG pass Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game eventually with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal in her Champions League debut less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French league champions, but the team lost several chances before eventually increasing their lead as Cavan hit the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, in the same A-block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as the game had not only a sequel, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter-finals in the final three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and later was traded from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team in which he started his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in statistics, and it’s a good start, even if there are things we’re going to have to work on this season,” Blanc said.
This anticipates good.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
After the injury, Ibrahimvic returned to the Parisian team in one of the three changes made after the team remained in a 2-2 draw in the Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux over the weekend, but he remained in the shade of Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he witnessed why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if someone was expecting an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a clogged opponent. It won Celtic in a settlement match as it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense as well as two players deep in the midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went past the pinch button from Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
On the other hand, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost passes and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in total in the first half alone and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective at pre-work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent a spiral kick, tilting around the Wiland goalpost at 52 minutes.
The second goal was eventually scored after an hour of play thanks to Cavani of Uruguay, who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimvic had swiped forward Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
It was the end of Malmö's hopes to get back in the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the exchange was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were at the same level as his team. The Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was in December last year”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'll put on my hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion by Selling Shares
The Swiss mining industry left Glencore, who suffered a major commodity price crash, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported that it had sold new shares for about £1.6 billion to shorten its debt.
A company that lost 57 percent of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed basic commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is straining demand and wreaking havoc on all markets.
The new entry raised the value of Glencore shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning trades.
The shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69% higher.
Glencore had unveiled $2.5 billion in stock trading last week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence of the share, which meant a 2.4 per cent reduction on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns over the long-standing halt in Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing in November.
U.S. President and Presidential spouse Michelle Obama arrange a dinner for Xi and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“The visit by President Xi gives the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively issues with disagreements,” the statement added.
On a visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is also expected to depart in Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and X are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyberspy and the country's increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays the difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight on Sunday evening, an experienced actor interrupted Brown, highlighting the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
“When we talk about difference, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not for the series,” Damon said.
Shocked Brown reacted to the injured in disbelief, commenting, \"Oh! Wow. Okay - while The Martian actor's comments remained hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series finalists.
“I want to urge people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is a whore who's hit by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their direction — could end up giving us something we don’t want —
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to resent Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film play, writing: “Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is so white that it hurts.
After its release, tweeting collected more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social conversation.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement as presenting the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently released a statement to answer Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved among entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
The professional rock climber and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior race on Monday and received a $1 million prize as a reward.
The competition programme, which ended its seventh season, has never had a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the programme's obstacle track.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten first climbed and solved the challenge on time, making him the first ever athlete to figure out the exhausting 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock at winning a million-dollar grand prize.
“It’s great to think that I’ve never made or lived for more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after a big raise.
So all of a sudden...I can't even imagine what this is going to be...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the fiinal and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he's the first ever competitor to have managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the one who has the fastest time,” Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels any resentment for that.
He is so happy to have done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, \"If anyone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac.\"
And I think Isaac would have thought the same if this had gone the other way.
The American Ninja Warrior returns to season eight, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their role perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins at 5-4 Target Field.
Twins missed the chance to get a half-way from Houston Astros in a race for another wild card spot in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how you get them,” Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end to this year,” Simon said.
It's hard for a change man to pass every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute striker Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first beaten runs since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first night of three strokes since he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
“He waved the bat well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked much better in batting practice, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Senter Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting twice out on the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, settled with a click of one nest, and Simon was able to burn directly Brian Dozier, a second base player, before Simon was replaced with a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player to stand up against, ahead of the novice surrogate Miguel Sano, who ran a two-hing run left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the pitch and a leveling runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal that led to the double game.
This was the record for the main series: 27th time this season when Plouffe hit the double game.
After Detroit had received a confirmation run at the start of the ninth, Mauer ran two beaten runs against Tigers shutter Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned I say in three passes in his fifth salvation.
In the beginning, Detroit used the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers received three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being off for more than a month due to an infection in the lower back.
It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this, Hughes said, but as the game progressed, I was more comfortable, and I felt like I could make a few nice passes in the third inning.
After Hughes grabbed the first base of the starter, he allowed the second base player, Ian Kinsler, to proceed in the meantime.
J.D. Martinez's walk to the right side in the event of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the batting ground, who took himself midfield to the first base and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tubes while runners were in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting the right and causing the second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he attempted to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued on the second inning and received one fire, two nests in the situation of a run catcher from James McCann and two fires, one nest in the situation of a run center from Anthony Gos, after which the situation was 3-0.
\"It was an important punch,\" Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to pitch and pitched a running third inning, after which he was replaced by a right-handed follower A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs out of six punches and a walk on four fires.
NOTE: Tigers' right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was thrown off due to a shoulder pull.
He was investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to shoulder strain, but he had to return Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' statistics in the Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to a right oblique abscess.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a wider open economy to the world
“The economy must be more open to the outside world to promote growth,” Xi Jinping told a group to guide the reform.
“China should commit itself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency,” he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of the general reform.
Supporting transparency at the same time as reforms are driven forward to increase new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a loosening of border control principles, a call on state-owned enterprises to seize private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created identifying the sectors and companies in which it is not allowed to invest.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for regional growth.
In order to open up sectors controlled by the state, more sectors will open up to private investors.
“The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
In addition, the application process for foreign permanent residence permits, green cards, is facilitated by optimizing requirements and easing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional rights for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, reported in a statement published after the meeting.
