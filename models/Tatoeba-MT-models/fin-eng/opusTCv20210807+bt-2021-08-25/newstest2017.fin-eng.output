28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell in a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and says, “His affairs were finally going well.”
The body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, San Francisco's coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a homicide and that an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC channel KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been a line chef in Boston, had obtained his dream job as a line chef at Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “horrified and shocked” because of his death.
“We have a small team that works like a close family and he will be missed very much,” he said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostels at the beginning, but that recently - his affairs were finally going well -
“He found an apartment and dated a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
“His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who drifted with the stream.
“In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day,” he said.
Anyone with information on the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Doctoral trainees on strike: Requirements for new industrial action measures
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial action measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) invites the entire Council to support new industrial action measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Doctoral trainees and medical students voted in July to reject the deal that had been agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members via Twitter Thursday night, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained — persistently silent — on issues that she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: “In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject fully the proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for the gradually advancing and expanding industrial action programme starting in early September.
The controversy has resulted in physician trainees taking part in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of the BMA medical trainees, Dr Johann Malawia, resigned after the vote had been rejected, the terms recommended by the BMA.
He had told BMA members at the meetings before the vote of 54,000 medical trainees and students that the deal was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be imposed on England's doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
Ele, which ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday, Russian and Turkish leaders met to shake hands with each other and declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
Yes, there was a handshake at the event.
But Putin's smile looked like a force, and he didn't give much heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, constantly talked about his — dear friend — Putin — five times, according to a report.
I lost count.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better one.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm reflected the opposite.
But the coolness that radiates from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The injury was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media led to an astounding, in-depth attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the charges of high officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by ISIS.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some kind of victory.
The benefits of a severe truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after being almost overthrown in the failed coup of last month.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines are certainly relieved as the flights eventually continue.
They want a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the importation of agricultural products from Turkey once again is allowed.
\"You're turist there, tomatoes back here - as formulated in the report of the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Adding a long-standing grudge over the fast-paced negotiations on EU membership, Putin emerges, eager to take advantage of the cool and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is clear to Moscow, who has his own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the spectacular seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present a “outside consortium” as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel that the West has abandoned them and mistreated them, uniting their forces.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It can be a lot to say that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with the matter.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can seek a common ground for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full disaster as a NATO member of Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that the two leaders are even talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland Disappears From Customers Outside Scotland
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was related to the bank's international goals.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
During this time, bank strategists have used the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listings, are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will become the employer of our investor brand and employees, because we are now becoming a much more branded bank”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we’ve done focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after having a total of 3,000 wins after a double win
Racing rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone in his second win of the evening at his home circuit while competing with Predilection coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in race riding.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won with Ghayyar, said, \"This is special -
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's an ordinary Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori absorbs cheers when he leads Predilection out after victory.
Two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle competitions — master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have achieved before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical wit distinguishes him from others in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey of weekends and big races!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for the British competition, but besides that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademarked drone landing from the saddle.
From flying endings to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing riding for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A pile of wins in big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and suffered a competitive ban over drugs.
Three years ago, he was initially struggling when he returned after six months of non-compete, but he showed significant character strength when challenging the doubters and returning to his best condition.
And he might go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin has -- ordered Ivanov to leave the post of head of the Russian presidential administration -- but there was no reason for this.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later led the president's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, \"Thank you for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in drafting laws and in managing the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his seat and recommended that Vaino be appointed in his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as a Soviet security service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting shown by state television with President Putin, both men claimed that the chief of staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite smiling at the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary election.
Is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with real doubt.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website to Putin, Ivanov said — it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give my four-year responsibility for this very complicated, even laborious, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months...
Ivanov accepted the mission in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to office only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month on the show's set in Los Angeles.
The series of producers, ABC Studios as well as CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and strife on the scene.
“I regret that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents' team can be expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
“I love the Criminal Minds series, and I’ve given it everything I can for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The start of the series' twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mysterious fish end up in the garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help in identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material on Periscope from the apparition, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry transit and the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four parentheses -- the curtains -- which are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 brush ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry transit.
We all witness truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this bridge section.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, finalizing the barrier between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precise dimensions must match.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete cover of the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be put on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first shutdown in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and combined with the expanding road cover of the northern pillar, we had to then close the remaining section from the northern side, that is, from the inland side.
This was done by pulling a land bridge of the northern fairway 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the earth bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at about 3% of the slope angle.
Demanding, because the permissible measurement deviations according to which the team worked were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Salvation on Moelfre Bay: Three men are lucky to be alive
Three men are —lucky to be alive — after they fell from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alert at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop on the Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
“We saw the boat move closer to the men and imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, the helm of the Moelfre lifeboat.
“Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving,” he added.
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, and a third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from the buoy without life jackets.
The men were taken into a coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the boat had a kill switch rope, but it had somehow been disconnected from the person driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people stand up from the couch and participate in some activity.
The screen time was originally limited to television, then video games, and now recently smartphones.
So it’s great to see that technology and outdoor activity don’t rule out each other.
I am, of course, referring to the fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they spawned a cartoon series, playing cards and other sequels).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days did Pokémon Go have more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS, and which, after being discovered, can be — photos — (through a screenshot of the phone) or — caught —
A generation that played the game when younger has joined the fad and jumped up from the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in daily steps — the average person.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following Cardiogram.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
The exhortations of many public health campaigns —to find a 30-foot couch —and —be active every day —have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and are passed on by people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activeness helps with weight management, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving funmakers are looking for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
And then what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they did not give a reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new charm disappears and the use subsides in due course.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better fit, and healthier.

Simone Biles took gold in women's gymnastics multiplayer game
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth on the boom.
I can't believe the permanon.
Great everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multiplayer championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world highlighted in the Olympic spotlight.
His overall score, 62.198, was clearly better than the silver medalist and —Final Five — teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
U.S. Simone Biles at the balance boom in the final of women's gymnastics multiplayer individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Billes became the fourth American woman to have won the multiplayer championship in succession, and the fifth overall American champion, while strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation, and perhaps all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class with the best athletes of his other generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Cup medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose mix of ambition and precision has been so amazing that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him — the best gymnast I ever saw —
The final test awaited in Brazil, a race that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of overly high expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the multi-match of women's scaffolding gymnasium in individuals' finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles achieved his first medal on Tuesday when he served as the culmination at the departure party of the retirement national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future as he went his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - which includes the volt passing of his trademark - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a toddler by her grandparents, who was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a study trip to the gym where Boorman trained, has become a powermaker.
He hasn't lost in a multiplayer game since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and permanto, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He climbed to the top with boom points 15,433 and surpassed them by receiving 15,933 with a permanon.
Raisma hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points — mere formality — and tears rose to Biles' glitter-red, white, and blue-lined eyes when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of regress from four years ago when he was in split third place, but lost a bronze to Mustafina in the renewal.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call “grandmother,” was clearly in charge.
He sent air kisses to the public after his permanto performance in an emotional buzz of return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Biles is concerned, the widespread tweet of this 19-year-old from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in the first serial killer incident in Phoenix last decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12.
A gunman standing on the passenger's side of the car fired a handgun up to eight times and then escaped by another vehicle.
Police say the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or another adult victim had $2,900.
A Phoenix police representative, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to examine whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks in four months, which have been carried out in two predominantly Hispanic districts.
“These things happen in the residential area in front of the home,” Howard told CBS subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers have refused to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
A witness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police bulletin on the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple murder and targeted an empty pickup truck, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, bullet seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly:
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder from which his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
What is not at all true, of course I promised, he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that ‘I didn’t know people were still doing it’,” Picciuto said.
Edmund walks with a walk stand.
Edmund did not sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still does not speak.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how to sign Edmund's inventions -- would you sing to me --
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a standard sign language - he tells us Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of reasons: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven’t asked for a prediction in a while because I don’t expect anyone to actually give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's gonna get easier.
You love your child and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with further rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana as well as southern Mississippi flooded over their puddles and caused a widespread flood threat due to extreme rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said the state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to the counties that need it.
Governor's Office for Safety and Emergency Preparedness, Mike Steele, said they were receiving requests for high tide vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sacks of sand.
The flood watch runs until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
In a statement, the weather service said that another three to five cents more rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect on Friday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood peak record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of Ascension County, which is below the river, as the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
To the south of the Mississippi state border, the Tickfaw River, flowing in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at the highest level ever at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers still picked up people from floodwater in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that normally more than 400 feet from his house, the water in Beaver Creek rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepson who lived nearby warned him.
“We woke up, and the water just kept rising,” Hansford said.
It stretched all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members all have injuries, and that he is the only swimmer.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued the three in a large, military-style truck and took them to the Gloster Fire Station, where the rescued stayed on Friday.
Krautmann says that floods — quickly spreading wide — as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated by heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding led to the rescue of Tangipahoa County residents from their homes and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reports that a member of the city council in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now under flood.
The county chairman, Robby Miller, said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been trapped by high tides.
The cities of Amite and Hammond have been opened with shelters for those who have been evacuated.
“They can return to their homes when the water starts to drop,” he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
“The last major flood here was in March,” said Lacy Landrum, the city’s administrative authority.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Director Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but so far no floods have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, Townson said, and the rain is still going on.
SIX-Year-Old Mahaj Brown Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another six-year-old was shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
“He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was starting the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between several shooters.
Attack weapon-type shells, originating from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was a constant struggle.
There were shells on both sides of the sidewalk.
“So it looks like there were several armed fighters here and that they were in active combat,” Philadelphia police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area also received hits.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, police are investigating the footage of the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a stray bullet on her hand on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s why I call this year’s women’s Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren-Laurie — Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic winner, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to have successively won individual gold in a women's multiplayer match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the sport, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They're -Final Five - (last five) because in the next Olympics, the gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's final year as a coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Much of these gymnastic clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 young people in the city (mainly black and Latino) and have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that’s great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We are living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious — girl strength — by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Doctoral trainees organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to coerce the agreement, saying that the NHS was —on unknown ground — and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new agreement, which includes changes to the nighttime and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainee Committee, said last night in a statement: “Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially about accelerating the existing labor crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally —
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have met with the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes with deep silence.
In spite of Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month, his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the coercion and take into account the concerns of medical trainees.
If he does not do so, medical trainees will be ready to continue work-fighting activities.
The last strike at the end of April meant nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 reception times were postponed when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 medical trainees under the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical trainees to avoid going on strike.
Mortimer said: “Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause worry, anxiety and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returnees, costs of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England education organization and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefitting from a two-pound daily-paying drug after authorities recommended that it be given to people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, drops the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to further calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still calculate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people have a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of these suffer a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the fatty material accumulated in the artery wall, which forms narrowings.
If narrowing ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks off, it can pass along with the blood and cut off the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making coagulation less likely.
A draft NICE guidance published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective prophylactic treatments, up to a quarter of people with a heart attack will later have a second heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating —
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation for ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to a number of thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since the efficacy and safety data for ticagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, treatment is not recommended in the draft guidance for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
Former Mayor Lutfur Rahman of Tower Hamlets was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to a government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles blunders the police, election overseers, and city councils for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud — due to race and religious hypersensitivity.
A former community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to place guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an ID when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voters only have to say their name and address.
The report even suggests putting in an indestructible ink on the finger of a voting person so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be better protected, says Sir Eric.
He calls on the press to have greater access to council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This would not only protect against electoral fraud, it would protect local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud,” he said.
The government ordered the report as a result of the voting scandal of Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, the Special Election Court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal activity.
The court stated that Rahman -- cynically distorted the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamic fear.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of a person voting, appearing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at voting for electoral fraud by post, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity with an ID
“The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the wishes of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
“There were concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such conduct due to 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity.
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling ballots received by mail in order to stop collecting votes.
The report, which Theresa May is examining, also calls for more stringent amendments to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at the options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use indestructible ink on the voter’s finger so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic national checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from handling ready-made sounds and envelopes that come through the mail, where voices are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier to accuse people of intimidation based on the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric tells the Greater London police force that it is “astounding” that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court stayed as a result of the numerous corruption and illegal activities of Lutfur Rahman and his officers,” he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without suspicion, according to the threshold of criminal evidence.
He also criticizes the inefficient -- cross-checks -- in the city council voting registration offices.
Sir Eric said, “Last year’s Tower Hamlets conviction was a revival.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as a birther of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's bicyclist double flight and other celebrity images at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast with his own famous doppelganger - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens right now, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin found on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter since his photos surfaced, showing a frightening resemblance to The Wolf of Wall Street star.
And, in fact, becoming aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that he has heard since childhood that he looks like Leo.
“I don’t see much resemblance, except maybe with the beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons of London from 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: the startling resemblance between Britain's long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustefina's grand, expressive eyes have been said to be the twin of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared for years to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the sporty version of Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more to do with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.
Hard Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarities between the two
A Twitter user recently expressed his happiness that — others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical —
And the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile matches the smile of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer — dead as a pig —
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of women's 4x200-metre freestyle message infuriated viewers of CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer — lost as bad a smell — and — died like a pig —
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-metre freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC reporting team to bring — the color — was heard saying, “That little 14-year-old from China messed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that...
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the message at the time of the second leg 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to capture China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC commentator just say that China’s 14-year-old swimmer ‘died like a pig’???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the 4 x 200 metres women's freestyle relay final as follows: \"That little 14-year-old from China messed up, baby...
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was thick and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist gang.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized on a live broadcast for MacDonald's comment, saying: \"We regret that the comment on the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that this happened.
The CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and attached an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The television company quickly apologized and issued a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent live.
We quickly took action last night and apologized to our viewers and followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on a live broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
“I would like to apologize for the comment I made yesterday night after the women’s message,” she said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
\"It is unnecessary to say that I did not mean it as disrespectful, and that I am truly sorry.
Primark's client outraged by a woman who rudely matched underwear in the middle of the store
Customers did not know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of the Primark store to try out underpants.
Things didn’t get any better when he assessed what he looked like in his pants, the woman peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He went on touring and eventually matched four pairs of underpants in a store located at Bouverie Place's shopping mall in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman matched the underpants and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the store, said that after trying on underwear, a mysterious woman — dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything —
He said, \"People didn't believe their eyes.\"
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of exposed underpants, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on her matching legs.
He didn't even try to find a remote place to make atonement, he just stood there shameless.
Everyone was staring at him while he took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting.
Davidson, a 33-year-old in the town of Kent, said: “It’s disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but hasn’t cleaned.
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale after the woman left, which is fine.
“It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven’t been washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the Folkestone Movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from the market.
This allows you to defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to a New York resident of Krav Maga Federation Grand Master Rhon Mizrach to find out how to deal with gun-wagging robbers within close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or back, this video shows you how to pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attacker and —rait the line of fire —
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue by striking the knee into the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to curl, twist the gun out of his hands, hit him with the back of the gun in the face, and back off, keeping the gun aimed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to launch.
Put weight on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point a gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide
British travelers have put a serious challenge to their immune system and vomit reflexes by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and most repulsive places.
A host and travel writer from Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, licked euro banknotes, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet flush button, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to get into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a film called The Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train wash button used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly talked to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester of the resilience of his intestines as he traveled around the world and ate strange and miraculous things.
This task from public rail station rail railings to toilet seat flush button did indeed test his immune system.
In the film, he said, “Since childhood, I’ve been quite careless about my health, and I’ve put all kinds of things in my mouth since dirt, worms, and murky water.
He confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometric reading of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer's result showed more than 4000 units, and the result of the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler’s film, The Inner Power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, \"This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet.\"
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
The inner strength was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gephilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to boost human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of Valio’s snacks, juice and new categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian' -
They argue that an interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and its connection to the immune system.
Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the documentary, added: “Let’s just say it like this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him.
Understandably, some of the licking things were easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks stored...
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to abdominal and intestinal well-being, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products with lactic acid bacteria added.
The Öykäri family destroyed the rental house in Saltash, Cornwall, before eviction
The Öykäri family caused £50,000 in damage to their rental house after being evicted due to the terrorization of neighbors.
Tanya Keldo and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained about numerous times.
After they had been forcefully removed from the property, shocked housing company officials found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls had gaping holes, the floor boards had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor, and the walls had been stained with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, host of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid the property could not be repaired.
He said: “This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don’t think people should have to live this way.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is ill-reputed, and their name is bad-reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property at times, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, quarreling, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was in the lease agreement, received a decision on antisocial behavior.
Old waste was found in many of the rooms under the demolition threat.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs were previously transmitted, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting on the street, and that police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing by force evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period, 11 weeks, time to voluntarily change.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One said, \"They didn't care about anyone.\"
We lived next to them for 20 years, and things have always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone...
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the wild walls of the rental house.
He added: “It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own and family’s conduct, for eviction is always the last course considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions certainly horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the brave members of the community who have given us information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behavior will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
After the eviction, a dirty mattress left on the floor of a single bedroom
Housing company employees now need to clean up the waste stacks surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis, as well as a scale, supplies, and £1700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting his guilt for possession of a class B drug as an intention to distribute it further.
He claimed that the money was intended for the gravestone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner live homeless after now being left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say they seek to evict residents who mock the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
“This is a message to those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such behavior,” he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun worship tourists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft swept by from very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, the horrified tourists began to panic when a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came close to contact distance from sun worshippers in the sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up as they understoodly began to worry about the noise from the jet, even though they did not initially see what was coming towards them from behind the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who posted videos of a dramatic pass-by on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: “It passed twice at a really low level, and at one point it seemed like it was about to crash into the ground —
Nuno Arroja added: “I was surfing and it really felt like the plane was falling on me.
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane appeared out of darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by the smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured that no one was in danger of safety.
This summer, the fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly at low visibility due to adverse conditions, the smoke caused by wildfires, and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exote's first half result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Eksote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote’s profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues.
The exote covers a deficit previously created by a surplus.
The remaining portion of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
Eksote’s Board of Directors will discuss the half-year review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers Sworn in Military Whale in Immola
The 70 conscripts of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
A military oath ceremony for conscripts from the Border and Coast Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Frontier Jaeger Course took place on the garrison's sports field.
A military oath was made by 70 conscripts.
Special frontier icebreakers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special limit.
250 of them were invited to the selection exams.
Special icebreakers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The Veterans' Meeting held in connection with the Vala event included five veterans of the wartime frontier forces.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A circle of robbers ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police departments has had an RTA, or Crime Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
The Häme Police Department consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's run by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The chief officer is Lieutenant Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civil person dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The setting up of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, that is to say, that the police are less and less likely to go to the place of the swamps until they receive an alert.
With the help of the data collected and analysed by the unit, day-to-day police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
Along with the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre was established in the country, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit for each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the Central Criminal Police in Vantaa, manages the operations nationwide.
According to its name, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in divided areas according to police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in RTA have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm task database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminal or mutually similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, the author will form a certain image.
The selection can be done either on the basis of an act or on the basis of a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public.
There is no indication of the methods used by both the criminals and their own, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent crime prevention attempts by the police.
Police will tell you in public if they expect to pose a threat.
This was the case, for example, in early summer, of the method of marking vacant dwellings used in housebreaks.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to try whether the residents were actually traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest order the minutes of the District Court, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, the thieves will go with their gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyze information to help plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour force and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of the institution and Finland.
ISIS schoolgirl killed in Syria in London
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumored to have died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just while she was planning an escape from a war-torn country and returning to Britain.
“One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a testament to others that there are real risks to leaving the war zone — that it could cause people to give up making such a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family were told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland's Supreme Court candidate if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since he was appointed by President Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says that the next president will elect the person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday at a phone conference that he predicts — with some certainty — Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not talked to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want -- to swing the boat -- with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans who block Garland's nomination are Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's minions -- and potentialists --
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says that the nude calendar is — for women as well as for men —
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with plenty of nude images is different from the old-school Playboy, because -Playboy is for men -
I do this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
“We have to start showing off timeless and classic nudity where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired with these images of the naked female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personally open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's destination: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush to fill in the comment section with irritable insults, the author of which is the pseudonym NoAllLonelyMen of Middle Ages, note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the new arrival of much-spoken records is not due to the fact that more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing for the middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl record are most likely between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely of all records to be purchased by persons aged 18 to 24 are those belonging to the age group.
It’s also not just about collecting amateurs, but it involves emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their emotions inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would sign up very quickly before I stopped, form a cup of my hands and say something authoritative, such as:
Let's take a closer look.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly being removed -- hotels, chain restaurants, stores, and office supplies now fill buildings with previously independent stores -- a handful of stunning specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while as I stand very close to different men in some of these shops trying to evaluate by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, followed by Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, likely in twenty), spends her afternoon in London due to a meeting, and rolls around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
I guess I am, he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the photo above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for such a huge amount of records and singles is partly a result of his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can rebuy those that he sold when he was young and broke.
“Most of the material I bought was from the late 60s and early 70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get,” he said.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my evil...
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients she encounters fit into YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people affected by the enthusiasm of the media. People who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and have become in need of buying back their old records.
Based on the conversations I have had, people have gotten rid of their collection usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records, he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of vinyl awakenings of certain ages.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the persistence of familiar disk covers; objects that evoke memories of teenage happiness days.
“I think sometimes it may be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that ownership of objects creates,” Wez said.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
“We’re like their social workers — another employee said suddenly from the pile of records.
A poll conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look gravely concerned when I browsed the stack of Bossa Nova collections.
This aspect of awakening, the award, is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men), has also noticed.
“Someone came in a while ago and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead’s record so we can put it on the shelf’,” he said.
This is not a big part, but this is definitely what happens.
More products, less music.
We have people who say, \"I don't have a record player.\"
Not the parents, but the younger people, the late-aged ones, who are just getting excited about it.
In the world where there is now almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, there is a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventies of couples, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than the above-mentioned movements - the speakers are catching Wild Beast's freshest synth and sex-filled pop, rather than improvisation jazz - it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes watching various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
It's expensive.
It’s easy to listen to music on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is — he sighs in love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While trying to look like I was studying jeans shorts, I observed a group of teenage girls flocking around Polaroid cameras for a while before father and daughter pondered the purchase of Crosley's turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's pure art vinyl.
But considering that even the slightest attention that these items receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho pits to get more, there is not much to complain about here.
It comes as no surprise that the part of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly do not spend their Thursday mornings wandering around the Berwick Street record stores, browsing records and avoiding the eyes of a creepy 30-year-old fake television host who peeks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say the busher has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record is on a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
French court rejects request to close deal in Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected Calais authorities' application to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
In court proceedings this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle altogether 72 temporary stores, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
Calais' Prefect's office argued that places should be demolished because they represent a non-taxed parallel economy and because they are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals provided by the state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people running temporary trade, but said that Calais' prefect's concern -- was completely understandable --
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people — living in extremely precarious conditions.
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which serves 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the coffee shop would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 -- to a top rating -- since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food is reduced sharply to the pleasure of consumers and to the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
In the last three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen to the second most in EU countries with the same level of pay as in Finland.
In comparison countries only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are presented in the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Development Manager of Statistics Finland, published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
The magazine compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices reached close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then came the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The price is now being weighed by Russian food import bans, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
The large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been shown as spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a place of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a wage level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
The magazine compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the price of food, we need to halve VAT to the average of EU countries and continue to compete in prices,” Lehtinen wrote.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer the same.
Those returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been drawn up, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a rule that all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fiction is abandoned, and instead, coding is started in schools.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies begin by the fourth.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It was once thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how we try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even the known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the world today.
In the animal kingdom, it is surpassed only by an Icelandic clam whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the rate of growth is slow, according to the following, only about one centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-cent Amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice sharks only reach sexual maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years of age at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300, no salesmen cut
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from the department store company Stockmann.
Co-operative companies in a company that ran into difficulties ended in early August.
“As a result of the negotiations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be implemented as redundancies,” Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of vendors in department stores will not be reduced so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, around 80 support workers are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the time of their start, the need for reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in making the department store profitable are at the background.
Although the Group’s adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store still makes losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, the acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not met the company’s targets.
“Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail’s positive operating result in 2018” Veijalainen says in the statement.
The result improvement for the second quarter was particularly driven by the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales and earnings ever.
Lindex’s operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
In the same period last year, the total Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, HS meteorologist.
There are also rain showers in the central parts of the country, but there is a pout in the south.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as the whole country has less than 20 degrees of mercury.
In the northern rainy areas, 10-15 degrees Celsius remain.
Kenya's Athletics Team Shakes Doping Scandal - A Bizarre Explanation of Coach's Temptation
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah performed as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency reported that the athlete on which Anzrah attempted to perform is the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample in a surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi says Anzrah was sent home because he committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour — Kip Kiinte, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, in turn, would storm the news agency Reuters.
Athletics at the Olympics will begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is one of Rio's winning favourites in advance.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah only walked on the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When he was met by anti-doping officials, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed, the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Olympic Stadium.
On Friday, Rio started a battle for athletic medals, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stand.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day of the morning and 65% of the tickets for the evening were sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium bulged with cheering crowds.
Final tickets have already been sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympic Games have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty seats have been seen in the stands of rugby, canoeing and riding.
When Brazil's medal wishes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12,000 spectators were only filled with about 30 percent.
The bad thing is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian racer, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians used to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not get the football stadium full.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for race organisers, said 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is a much smaller number than four years ago.
“There are still 1.1 million remaining to sell,” Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, as organizers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less well-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places in Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sand of Copacaba has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were plenty of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, businesses and entities can redeem the rights of holders of land with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of the holder in return for payment.
The holder receives a veto in his 187-square-square-foot block, which in practice means that not every holder is required to be approved if the purpose of use of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Obtaining the right to control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don’t have to carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature — Juha Leviäkangas, who has acquired the right to control his company, explains.
A person who has acquired the right to control receives accurate location information from his block, which enables, for example, a visit to the block.
The names of the holders of the rights displayed on the Foundation’s website are shown on the same map where the block information on the land can be found.
Leviäkangas sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only that the Foundation’s operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act in some way unethical or commercial, but it should not be possible.
The Haltija project of the Helsinki Foundation is based on the idea of protecting nature areas so that they can be untouched and at peace.
The foundation acquires land either by buying or by donating.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and is planning a land acquisition from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment the biggest cities in Turkey - see the situation in your home municipality
Bicycle thieves torment the biggest cities in Finland, Turkey.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bike thefts reported to the police, which in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year have stolen bicycles and their parts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were at the top.
According to police reports, there were four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
In other cities, double the number of thefts compared to others, according to police inspector Tommi Ree.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer.
“The prevalence of theft can be influenced by how much bikes are used in the city and how many bikes there are at all,” says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
The Finnish Police Board Tommi Reen considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
The market has a tight centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are distant from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, the police have reported slightly fewer bicycle thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police report a little more than 20,000 bike thefts per year.
It means 50-60 fillers every day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes a year.
It's a lot of money, Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a crime report on bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police survive.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one in which the police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in blood.
“Cases can also be resolved in connection with other investigations, when, for example, stolen bikes can be found in a drug case in the apartment,” says Reen.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from bicycle racks, inner yards, warehouses and wheel cellars, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopoi are the most stolen of individual bike models.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but much of the stolen bikes end up being sold online, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
“At least it has not been known to the police that a lot of stolen bikes are going abroad,” Reen says.
According to police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he can commit a crime or violation of concealment.
“The alarm clocks should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clearly low price,” Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colourful Nopsa every day during his working day to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but no one has been stolen, says the Moose.
“Perhaps this does not attract thieves so much, there may not be a hipster value here either,” says Hirvi from Helsinki.
Siiri Valve, a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike snuggled the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks his bike into something fixed, like a bike rack.
“There will be quite a lot of thinking about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I have ever owned — a student in Helsinki says about his white bike, whose body alone cost about 500 euros.
All the time, you hear from your friends that the wheels have been stolen.
- Mostly bad spins, you know? - Yeah.
A bicycle was stolen from the building’s inner courtyard a year ago.
However, the bike had not been locked, so Valve could wait to take it.
Under 15-year-olds are responsible for their crimes.
Helsinki to test peer-to-peer crews from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer jury is tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment applies to children under the age of 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
Peer jury intervenes in the first juvenile crime.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth Services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of mediation that are used in parallel.
“Everyone steers the young person’s actions in a more responsible direction so that not everything is ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model has been introduced into the Peer Jury from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not come before an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, service designer at Palmu, the service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
“It has been a message that you should continue on the path you have chosen,” Lovio says.
The Peer Jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new approaches are offered to all those in need, not just migrant youth.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft to see it.
According to the paper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be diverted to Congressional elections instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his recklessness, incompetence and record unpopularity threaten to bring the Democrats a landslide in this election,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is prominently Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from — people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress — and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton Offers Relief to US Families with Children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reported details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the US economy is doing well for everyone.
“Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends,” Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by increases in the tax of the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American businessmen who suffer after factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it must pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I oppose any trade agreement that works against employees or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the economic program released by Republican Donald Trump on Monday for favoring only such millionaires.
Clinton has previously called Trump a loophole in corporate taxes.
On Thursday, Clinton announced that she was the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of small businesses whose bills Trump has failed to pay, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America,” Clinton said.
These are the Rio ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Normally, sports competitions appear in TV viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a high number of spectators.
At the same time, 12 per cent of the population have been glued to the screens: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle’s Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
For comparison: the European Athletics Championships one month ago attracted almost 800,000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
The most interesting thing about the Olympic Games so far has been the cycling of Sunday night and the scaffolding gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the race, both reaching the Olympic channel at a time nearly half a million spectators.
Yle sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and recalls that the viewers will be split at the Rio Olympics for the first time in several different instruments.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympic Games.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competition for which Yle has dedicated a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, that’s a good base.
The number of spectators is lower than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - much of Rio's race broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a weak interest - if anyone now thinks it's lame - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced upwards with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
According to Pokkinen, the number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store in the first days of the Games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're going to be around 200,000 downloads now.
“We’ll only get online ratings later,” Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as intended for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been accompanied by delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct the errors.
The Olympic Games in Rio will be visible on Yle’s channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some sports from Yle Fem, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts the competitions daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last that can only be followed by Yle’s channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 meters in Ristenselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a press of about 20 square metres on the Ristiback, the depth of which was 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried to strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres stretch from Lake Toisvesi, Lake Toisvesi and Lake Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
There might well be unknown depths, Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by means of medium depth, it is Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
In this way, Päijänne cannot reach the ten deepest and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph with the deepest middle depths of the lakes were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax cut: Pensioners' taxation continues to be tighter
Pensioners are still more heavily taxed than wage-earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievances were raised under parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage and salary earners.
The Government’s proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made after the election should be kept, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The issue heated up opposition representatives in the parliament, who then grilled the finance minister Alexander Stubb (kok.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not increase
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Kok.) is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo’s messages about the desire to honour the competitive agreement that has been achieved with great effort.
He says that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It comes in need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people’s own confidence in the future.
Involved in long-term unemployment
Ihalainen appeals to the government that it would tackle long-term unemployment in the budget debate, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were approximately 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s target of increasing the employment rate to 72 per cent will run out.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reported in Thailand attacks
Last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy’s instructions for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish Thai travel season dates to the turn of the year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook following the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen says the perpetrator of the attack is not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and to last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who announced that they were opposed to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population persists, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She said it was the Queen’s birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are “local sabotage” and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourists' favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In a popular tourist destination in Finland, four bombs exploded at night on holiday island Phuket, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current reports, there were no casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded in the popular tourist destination Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in each double bomb attack.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Thani and in the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it leads to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the military junta that controls Thailand, says the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We should not incite people to panic any more,” he told reporters.
Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators had intended to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns planning to travel to Thailand should not cancel their trip because of the explosions, but it is worth following the non-exhaustive instructions for caution, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims that took place during the night in Finland.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has been a little bit more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in Hua Hin's last attack.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
The chief of police, interviewed by CNN, says that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Than, which exploded every half an hour or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Aliya Mustaf of Russia with a third performance of 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for scaffolding championships at the Rio Games with permano, jump and boom.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics for the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the other year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The lower World Cup medals at the Biles have jumps and booms.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: ‘Isku has no impact on tourism’
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don’t think there will be anything more amazing about this,” Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, estimated.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have hit Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu and last year the bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this is hardly the case either.
The Huovila company’s office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called about nine o'clock local time and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed in the early morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on due to the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three o'clock during the day in Thailand, traffic on Patong had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later this car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description, hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to the motor vehicle.
The police are grateful for the clues.
Research leader on Russian leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, Russia’s highest-ranking change in leadership took place in years when President Vladimir Putin sacked the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov is succeeded by 44-year-old Anton Vaino of Estonian origin.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second husband.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling management positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from gaining power independent of the president.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop in Ivanovville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On a tape presented by the state media, Putin called the change a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino as his replacement, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov’s point of view, this is a clear station drop.
Environmental and transport issues are not of high priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most significant people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the Presidential Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but became president by Dmitry Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, has recently been changed in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Finnish Institute for Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin is changing his surroundings to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as a human shield while retreating in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so that we would not aim at them,\" said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's document disclosure policy is unlawful
The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authority’s own policies, but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Minister of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister’s calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry’s Communications Director says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the prestigious Games.
He injured his back way from the early season and was forced to skip the Olympic qualification in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
“I’ve been practicing well and that’s key,” Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-wear samba dancers and fan-turned journalists.
Around Porina Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the initial 200 metres at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, crushing the world record and competitors' self-confidence despite the finale of the party, at a time of 9.69.
This is more difficult
A year later at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached the end of his career with a watch.
The world record for Berlin was 9.58 by 100 metres and 19.19 by two hundred.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-metre world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes in its creation except Bolt himself.
At 100, Bolt's biggest challenge is the 2004 Athens 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the prestigious Games if he has made his way.
In Daegu, 2011 the 100 World Cup final was left unrun by Bolt due to cheating.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the sport of young men, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
As the final finish line for the career, Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it,\" Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone Epo.
He finished fourth in Rio in a women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese swimmer has filed a doping case with the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There have also been other doping allegations in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female obstacle runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone Epo.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach from Rio home because of the doping crime.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test and had given a doping test for him.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan fast track coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Phelps won't be stopped - historical gold comes in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in a 200-metre mix of his 22nd Olympic win in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach Olympic gold of the same sport in four consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second in the mix before Wang Shuni of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic Swimming Commentator Helen Skelton laughs at a quick interview in Evening Magazine.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is the most read on this week’s Iltalehti website.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton is not much stressed out if there is little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and peculiar costumes.
Television is a visual medium, he said.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress with at least enough revealingness - for the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back steps.
It's important to look good, and little fuss is just a funny thing.
Skelton certainly wants to sparkle and perhaps startle, but he stresses that he does not want to be the lead role.
This is not about me, he said.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that it has reached Finland?
I can’t, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me.
You know what?
It's a stir from nothing if it comes from dressing up (the host).
I'm a little bit amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police arrested two people for suspected terrorism
Rio police said Thursday that it had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the safety oversight of the Games.
The police made five other arrests at the same time and questioned two people before they were released.
All of the suspects were Brazilians.
According to the G1 news website, those arrested because of terrorism are among the same group that was arrested by police in July.
The detainees are believed to have links with the Islamic State.
Those arrested had reportedly sparked violence on social media.
Messages calling for violence had been distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The Rio Games have 85,000 police officers in charge.
Police detonated a suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first round of Rio basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police let the audience in after they had successfully blown up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blasting mission.
Police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The audience was able to enter after the police had controlledly blown up the package.
The audience did not reach the audience by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and let the public in the hall only after that.
The drink awakened the Spanish team that started the competition sleepyly.
Spain, which started the two defeats, won Nigeria with 96-87 points.
In the last two games, Spain achieved silver.
The police conducted a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The police last had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling goal site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their first round of Rio basketball tournaments in front of empty stands.
Argentinian dame snuggles Petäjä-Siren - Finnish protester
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a rough time on Thursday.
The Argentine dame bled Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the Women's Surf Day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offense.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others escaped, Finland’s head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protesting for a long time.
It was not worth it because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
“I should have fallen into the water to get a refund,” Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the end because he did not want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
In the crash, the Finnish left 27th place.
In total, the 2012 London Olympic Silver Medalist is the eighth.
When it came to the tip, the crash didn't have much effect.
Friday is an important day when you have to race 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things That Science Says Will Extend Your Age
Science has studied everything that is possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health in such a way that his or her life lengthens.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence can bring them extra years.
These include a tendency to medium body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can increase your age.
You don't always have to waste your time - just picking up a milk can is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through a variety of studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research findings.
According to science, all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated — with a reduced risk of death — especially with neurological or heart-related diseases.
Again, studies suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of floss can extend a person’s life by more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They can also contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected a person’s life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live when the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also prolong the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of his life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, sports bring extra years, there is no denying it.
However, reaching a long age does not require an absolute slenderness.
One Oxford University study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it’s an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor who won the Olympic Games, he’s more likely to live longer than a regular blizzard.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring his or her life to an extra year.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the long life is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible, for example, to pursue confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over the age of 65 found that a person shopping on a daily basis was likely to be older than those who shop less often.
This is due to the fact that spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk drunk driver crashed into a truck.
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car accident occurred in Kosken, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred at Koskentie, midway between Koskentie and Torvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came in was drifting into the lane at the same time, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck stood up in its lane, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into a ditch and then across the ditch to the roof.
A woman, born in 1972, who carried a passenger car, was squeezed into her car.
The rescue department removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's blow test was 2.02 per mil.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Post office sent loose candy to the wrong city
There were deficiencies in the selection of bulk candy at the K-Citymarket in Salo, because the post office had accidentally delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernio, was shopping for loose candy at the K-Citymarket in Salo on Thursday, when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets, because Posti delivered our cargo to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
If there was no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant’s foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
Mowering is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update struck me with a blizzard.
Media representatives have also been calling all along, and the attention this has caused is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to catch her favorites in a loose candy bag, even though a few pieces were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti’s Corporate Transport Services, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomit.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do a partial delivery (Salo) with three, but we only took five stages today,” Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomit.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not annoyed by the sign, because she found all her own candy favourites in the selection.
30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund posted a photo of her change
The comedian producer has lost dozens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of the change in life.
On Friday, Lotta shared a pair of photos of her change on Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract already in 2009.
She has undergone a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of photos of his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has collected a number of praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous.
We’re on the same journey, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures while I’m on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally reach a normal weight, which was then about 10 kg.
During the three-month period, the kilos eventually fell by five.
Desire for the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa a week ago hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and petitiones with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations to police dogs.
According to the publication, the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinarian Station as a substitute and also completed her nursing training there.
Veterinarians remember women with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and unafraid of work.
My good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisa, Koskenkylä.
The woman's neighbors have told the Evening Press that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The killer was tracked down by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation during the arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
District Court Sentences Post to Violation of Equality Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of the employee who refused to train the temporary agency worker, estimates Kanta-Häme District Court in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the employee’s salary, which corresponded to the part of the orientation in the whole day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage on the basis of his trade union activities in violation of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the decision of the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU on the prohibition of induction.
During the November postal strike last year, PAU made a decision that Posti’s employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to a path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his reply to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin sacks head of his administration - Estonian-based Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
The farm will be replaced by the grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin press release, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, will move on to special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino as his replacement, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union to spy on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2012 before Putin was re-elected.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition ban - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record for football transfers is not seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off over the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition, Paul Pogba, is sidelined due to a ban as ManU opens its league season Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association FA keeps him out of the game as Pogba was suspended from playing from Juventus.
He received two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it becomes a one-match ban.
That ban has been moved to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam play is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, grandiose madness is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starring top artists in the world.
Flow Festival starts in Helsinki on Friday.
Festivalists have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
One of the main stage artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival’s event area will be stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind the success is: What kind of event would the perpetrators want to go to?
It is quite unusual for events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with official regulations,” says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 last year by 5,000 people.
The festival will also feature a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be funded in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle that is controlled by huge lanes.
That's not what we want.
Over the past 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been expanded so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink kibars in the partly artificial turf area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stage performances, 15,000 people’s tent will serve as a venue this year.
He admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little magnanimous, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done on the rock is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activities were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20,000.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can also be used to produce —creasing things — such as the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with a distinctive dress.
Along with the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to be distinguished by content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen on a show in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's done some damn good shows in recent years.
Thailand tourist paradise bombs hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreign.
They were detonated at the same time as tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumra said.
Since 1989, Asian wildlife patron Edwin Wiek tweeted a much-spoken picture of the attacks.
If you don't see the TV properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, even favored by Finns.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another double bomb attack took place in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say the bombings are likely to result in insurgent troops who are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been involved in the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will go into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are ordered to combat duties only after several months of swearing a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Chief of Education of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat in the war situation.
According to the Head of Education, the first assignment to the service is to be made by reserve personnel belonging to the standby forces.
No conscript or reservist is ordered to a task for which the required training has not been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Finnish Defence Forces will start training conscripts in units of immediate readiness from next year onwards.
Units can be used for military operations, if necessary, already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from the home house
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
After the sale, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused hazardous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell their apartment in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld a district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the couple a total of EUR 47,344 for the trial and settlement costs.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because the buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling when they made the purchase.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the apparent building errors were significantly more serious than what had been presented.
Tola is looking for a good home
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the matters mentioned in the fitness inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that rainwater from the rock should be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it emerged that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, were caused by both rock rain waters and land humidity that had risen capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, the microbial-infested air was estimated by the inspector to have reached the interior via the porch as well.
Mold or yeast exceeding health risks were found in brush samples in the home care room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window marker and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision that the apartment had been changed in violation of the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in the court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not feel that the Court of Appeal had any particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their obligation to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
A creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finnish in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, how the National Archives of Maryland in the United States have microfilm records of a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the race agency in Nazi Germany.
The Race Agency served under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were carried out on women to investigate the issue.
The Race Bureau investigated women’s backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The aim was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breed agency handwritten biography and good recommendations from close friends.
The Race Agency wanted assurances that women were —children’s lovers — sparing and —good National Socialists — who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The program, among other things, stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, according to the U.S. Holocaust Museum website.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and supported the reception of children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between Aryans and non-Aryans were prohibited by law.
On the sixth of Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first departure of Finnjollie’s sailing day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the tail of the whole group in the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to No. 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day starts at 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were in 23rd place at the start of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää’s Satulinna was recorded during a couple of hours of sleep: “I was so hungover”
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland’s favourite artists for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship bartender to a 1995 tango king, Finland’s best-selling solo artist, and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still in a swing and is currently in a frenzy.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of his favorite singer, was published today Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The career of Sillanpää rose to a total climb as he won the Tango King's crown at the Tango market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so hung over!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
The recording of the song, which became a huge hit, would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the print was still good.
I learned that all the time you don’t have to insist on being perfect and top-notch.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular songs, described in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner, and the case eventually ended up with texts from the song You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story about his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but was written based on the news of the 7-day magazine.
The newspaper reported that Jari and his ex-lover were the cause of the divorce, but Jari said that it was a complete nonsense and that it was not true.
Jari played the book in a rage at the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of voters supported the difference and 48% would have stayed in the Union, although polls during the voting week were predicting the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged the resignation, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the recent election campaign of former U.S. President Bill Clinton, “It’s the economy, stupid” flew to the scrap booth in Britain’s Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial Curly Language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in its latest monthly survey provides professional answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to, because this time voters made a decision on grounds other than economics.
One of the economists’ explanations for the loss of economic status is that people don’t understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed people, that is, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the real British.
Many also believe that a decline in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments, because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently raised.
They were particularly challenged by the fairness of the BBC, which gave just as much space to economists representing only a couple of percent of the economists who supported the withdrawal from the EU as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hosted press was not interested in telling what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic combinations of capital letters are about the consequences of the difference.
Those distant letter combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, sovereign debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with which the voters feel they have no common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy.
The Brexit referendum was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will congest your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every café has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would real British children get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have given the British more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and particularly EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up A and B plans.
Plan B, or the victory of a camp that supports the withdrawal from the EU, began to be prepared in more detail a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid funds, but now they could be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets,\" Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily quoted real estate fund, which was covered by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund at the time was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at 10% or even below.
Real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds closed down trade
When the camp that supported the withdrawal from the EU won, Europe went crazy.
However, the two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, in which he estimates that Brexit can be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen its trading.
These together looted the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to pull money out in a panic.
Aberdeen’s message was that if you don’t have to take your money out now, it won’t be worth it because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the report.
Since then it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks,” Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen.
However, there were a lot of queries.
Reasonable attention to real estate funds
According to Vanhanen, the closures of real estate fund trades received undue attention.
The open funds affected by the closures control about 4% of UK real estate.
Aberdeen's shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might keep its funds closed for 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been raved downwards, but the situation does not seem to Aberdeen’s point of view — ferocious —
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The price of the pound and dollar is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar can now buy the same property for up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings cons to the real estate market in London
At 2 a.m., the situation didn’t look too good.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate manager for Aberdeen Asset Management from the British Real Estate Fund, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word of power.
I realized that this is now going to plan B,” Vanhanen says in her second home in Helsinki.
He immediately went to work.
The City of London was still alive in the morning.
The normally silent TV screens at the office were buzzing with the news, and usually the loud crowds were silently listening when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his resignation.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was the kind of morning that you never thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote.
The atmosphere was confused.
However, the company had prepared for the alternative well, which is why the situation was kind of calm,” Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote starts correction
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went to exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the UK and especially in the London real estate market.
In the coming years, the London office premises were expected to have a 20% reduction.
Soon, a group of UK real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still raging in the air.
However, it does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is far too early to say much about Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been first reported.
The real estate service company CBRE’s data on price developments covers approximately one third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the London City office buildings, the minus was 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have been worse figures in just five months, Vanhanen says.
All equally large drops occurred during the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
The comparison is not quite right, as it is now a domestic crisis in Britain.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity,” Vanhanen says.
Funding is available normally.
There could have been a repair anyway.
In fact, the price correction movement is not a miracle for him - it could have been there without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that real estate prices in London and other world-leading cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced,” Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have increased for four reasons.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London has grown as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that will become globalized,” Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the debt lever has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Divide, Divide
In London, prices increased last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten its ownership in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of change, and now it has come.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any spike in elevations.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady going on ahead.
Vanhanen has seen more moves up and down as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And still, he's an optimist who believes that the pit can be overcome with work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, there is too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are decentralized, says Vanhanen.
S Group begins to register shopping information in more detail
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group announced today that it will begin to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
When data has been collected so far on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start to collect it on the products purchased at the beginning of May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko’s customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data is collected with the consent of the customer and is used under license for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Talousanom.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in the registration of S Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers according to food purchases in ten groups.
The classification is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and is not currently planning one.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own Ykkösbonus loyalty program, which can be joined in Valitatalo, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment, we do not collect product or product level information, we remain at the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and which day and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of K-Group or S-Group,” says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell you about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product data will be registered.
First experiment
So far, SOK’s customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address information, the basic information also includes occupation, education, type of residence, the birth years of the children and previous personal data.
The members of the same economy and their role have also been registered.
The S-Etukortti purchase includes the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of purchases and the payment method.
In addition, the information of S-bonus partners is derived from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terroi and ABC-chains, data is currently recorded at the product group level.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more accurately,” says Marjaana Saarikoski, SOK’s Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in piles anyway, whether you like it or not.
You can check your saved data on S Group’s website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador’s puppy is actively sniffing five similar boxes placed in a row at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t take long for it to sit firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards her dog Heila to play with her favorite toy.
From the box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of powder gas resounding shells.
Ruutigas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs’ first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main job, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused measures at Customs and, after the attacks, supervision has been strengthened,” says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector General of Customs.
Another main reason for training the weapons and explosives dog for Customs' duties are postal deliveries through Helsinki Airport.
With the increase in internet sales, up to 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made approximately 300 discoveries related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, as well as their starting materials, among the online shop purchases, luggage of passenger aircraft and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and postal items.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research,” says Grönberg.
Based on Heila’s performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Tulli dog school in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also visits the police and Defence Forces experts to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki Airport include Customs’ six drug dogs and Massi’s money and drug dog.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as tranquility, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close co-worker with the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing can be done without him at home, he laughs.
Subtle orders will reach Heila from a one-time coat.
The cameraman of the evening-sanomat loses the camera's mic cover for a fast dog, but Heila returns a cover that looks like a soft toy from the immediate-loose command.
Tough Competition for Working Dogs
Heila’s initial training will be completed next year.
Level tests are still ahead, next October, where it will be assessed whether the training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron a dog wearing a work bra, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work only lasts from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is fierce competition at Customs.
Heila’s owner applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and supervision tasks at Customs.
Mini-state gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
The Olympic gold of Fiji with less than one million inhabitants in rugby is valued so high in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the national broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was resolved.
The day off is the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrates championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finale in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game connected our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard they were encouraging,\" said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer faints after fierce performance
The weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one really knows why.
Tokola received 175 kg for the push in Rio and 145 kg for the stunt.
His combined score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push at the last 175 kilos, as did his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with fierce roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury accepted the lift.
The Finnish buyer’s joy was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the Men's Football League, has concluded a lasting contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power and a threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than 10 players.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative,” RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Tallinn Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is due to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new striker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Next Next post: The Brave Modern Family Star Reveals Almost Everything
Ariel Winter, familiar with Alex Dunphy as the kindest character in the modern family comedy series, reprises by showing off her daring body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don’t leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior considerably more courageous.
The star has posed in pictures posted on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing extremely scarce costumes.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has recently released several photos of himself celebrating.
If you don’t see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
Amy Palmer, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter was undergoing a —typical Hollywood transformation — from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television almost his entire life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show a exposed surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his longtime fans with his image change.
“It’s not hard to guess where he will be in ten years, when the decline is already so severe,” says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what other people say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman gleams.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured to northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror Aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start their northern lights journeys in early autumn,” Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main tourist attractions of the Japanese Northern Lights are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the hallmarks of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early autumn and continues long into spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake’s surface reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times more fairytale,” says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland’s Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are lured to Finland with online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the University of Turku and the University of Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to have clearer unique sights in Finland, and this is where the northern lights have enormous potential, according to Lindi.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fidi's master class leads to gold
Britain's impressive advance in the rugby tournament collapsed to the final challenge presented by Fiji in the Thursday night final when the team experienced a 43-7 smash loss at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a master class in handling, chewing, dodging, supporting game, running lines and sheer force when winning gold - their first Olympic medal.
With the loss came a reasonable consolation of the silver medal - the third of the British day - and they were allowed to be proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby start-up tournament, in connection with which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard 7-5 victory in the semi-finals played earlier that day from South Africa could have plagued them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won even a top-performing team of 15 in this condition.
Great Britain may, but probably not, be comforted by the fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, former English boss from Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a trip.
Eight years ago, coached by Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently, rejecting UK tackles for fun.
To Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was as if they were running towards buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived at the corner to the finish area.
With four minutes on the watch, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped man-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring third goal, but it was just a slow move for Fid.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right corner, and Great Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the watch...the first half.
Then Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the British loose tackles and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal shoot, the situation at the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
The UK made a series of changes during the break that blocked Fidi's dam...for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pitching game.
Dan Norton captured a goal for Great Britain when he scored a touchdown at the left corner and narrowing the situation to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fidi’s joyous approach.
Mata Viliame with her last-minute goal had a frosting on Fidi's cake, which didn't need frosting.
The straw was whistled, the Fidites hugged and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Great Britain won in South Africa's tight semi-final, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick decided the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with dazzling footwork and scored under goalposts in the second half.
A mighty late tackle from Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of England's 15-side rugby team, secured the victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There will be no gold more emotional in these games, and that really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard swings towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, there were three votes on the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was present all the time when the duo ran their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's couple competition - the first women in British sports history books that achieved such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with a swan's sweetness, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful hand pairs that gradually contribute to those things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago after being diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was narrow.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky enough to be able to begin his treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside of the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first in a couple's thoughts was Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment of the Afghan Command, said: “I’ve been a wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me —
It just highlights how important this is to me, how hard I and Helen, and Robin, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he owes a lot of thanks, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have imagined a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race in five years.
The couple set a rough rhythm that their rivals could not reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very close in an instant.
Helen screamed -- stay in the process, stay in the process --
It is very important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything special.
We were not looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good rowing and winning the race, and we did.
A couple waits a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better, he said.
Iceland to change government over Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama data leaks called for as early as spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last spring will affect the result of the autumn election.
In June, the presidential election clearly showed criticality to those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected president from outside politics, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS.
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest tweets.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be involved in the creation of the organization by the founder and Democratic candidate of the terrorist organization ISIS, Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to sink so low as Commander-in-Chief of the Army.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned Muslim-popular burkini swimsuits from being worn at beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian, among others.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which broadly express religious affiliations, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two men linked to ISIS attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - Pyykösjärvi
The water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae has been detected on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the operational limits set out in the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococcal concentrations of the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the limits of the procedures.
The blue algae cloud observed on the shore of Lake Pyykösjärvi does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, causing the surface of the water to form blue-green algae mass as rafts.
Environmental action will monitor the situation with frequent inspections.
If the blue-green algae precipitation changes to blue-green algae bloom, it will also be announced separately on the notice board of the beach.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: Over 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one of the tax changes in the Ministry of Finance’s budget proposal for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change of forest holdings.
In the Ministry of Finance’s proposal, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest farm size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
A forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational changes in forest holdings is good,” comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry at the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, he finds criticism of the tax reform proposal.
A forest gift deduction is proposed to be made for the forest owner’s clean capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
In the opinion of MTK and Hakkarainen, the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM proposal starts with a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry to prevent a loss in the capital income of forestry, which would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would gain tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The limit on the tax deduction linked to the value of forest income is EUR 40,000.
It has been pulled too high, according to Hakkarainen.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest owners, he says.
At VM, it is considered that the border guarantees the goal of increasing the space size.
In forest policy, forest gift deductions have been taken decades, according to Hakkarainen.
This is due to the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Heavy hail surprised motorists in Himanga - two cars plunged into a ditch and collided with each other
On Friday morning, a special chase occurred at the Himanga in Kalajoki.
According to the Rescue Department, two consecutive runs of the car plunged into a ditch, after which the person behind him crashed ahead of him.
On-call firefighter Harri Pyyhtiä says that the derailment in the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hail.
The car behind him had two people, both being transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometres to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research findings from researchers at the University of Turku can help to make cancer treatments more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivanska, the growth of cancer was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on 4 August in Nature Communications, a respected journal in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home murder continues at court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for other perpetrators
Muhos's family home killing continues in court for both convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing in Muhos.
The second received 8 years for 4 months, including killing as a young person and aggravated robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and transport of the vehicle as an unauthorized young person.
The judgment of the District Court was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the man who received the harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man with a lower sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for a murder committed as a young person.
At the time, they were in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit at a school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old, who was convicted of murder, attacked the director from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had gotten out of the grip and led the young man into his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a mental examination, both convicted were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the court, young people had been planning an escape from a family home since at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrate in the world, increasing only at the age of 156
Ice sharks have been confirmed to be the longest living vertebrate in the world, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, such as Greenland, the ice shark, or vaulter, can live up to 400 years old.
The female does not grow until the age of 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of clam is known to live longer than the ice sharks.
Scientists discovered age by radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, the researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although a throw in one direction or another could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an Economic Wiseman - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
As much as a third of all government tax revenues would not be received if the change in corporate tax driven by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount of money, $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's reduction of 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely abolished.
Trump accused the state of excessive regulation of business and of bankrupting small businesses.
The decided environmental standards of the emergency must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector must be abolished.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed — experts instead of bureaucrats —
Trade policy is one of the main causes of the United States’ problems.
Free trade agreements would be abandoned.
A 45 % penalty tax would be imposed on imports from China and a 35 % penalty tax would be imposed on Mexico.
We offer a new future.
“Americanism, not globalism, is our creed,” Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will oversee the seas, American steel will raise new skyscrapers across the country.
Unlike his manners, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early Friday.
A wave from the past - People's News
The sea is dying, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street buzz - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel story.
Almodovar's previous directing work The Travel Lovers (2013) was a mini-fun and Ronskish-side satirical comedy, the pre-existing Skin in which I live the peaks of my Spanish career.
Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between the two works.
It is a serene love, interpersonal and family drama of the conventional, with a mother-daughter relationship at its core.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be modelled on the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) can be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She starts from the time before her daughter's birth, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta’s young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, is cast in the second female lead, from the series “The Time Between Ommelte” (2013-2014).
Julieta’s aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a slump, but I’d say that it’s pretty much a one-time wipe.
Almodóvar films are often so characteristic of flashiness, all the way down to humor in Julieta there is a fair distance.
It is an evenly portrayed, restrained, place in some places with good music and quite saddened film, which as such contains elements of its elegia.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there, and so that it slowly begins to stick to the eye as a pure form rather than a functioning dramatic power tool.
The characters in the film are plagued by diseases, deaths, or otherwise only sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the name person, the outfits change from scene to scene, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is to say, the tunes of the scene in question, are not improved.
Mechanically, when repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three short stories by Canadian author Alice Munro, who won the Nobel Prize in 2013.
The novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally unparalleled for even more intense drama, and so much of the big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the film's theme deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12 August.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No further cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made by a bunch of people.
There will be no further cuts.
The $4 billion savings already agreed on will be sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (kok.) say under the budget discussion.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits meeting.
Child benefit, national pension, basic security of unemployment and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training cuts continue.
Townships are haunting
Why do the ministers insist so strongly that no further cuts will be made to them?
Because next year is an election year.
The municipal elections will be held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result in different directions of the government parties spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallupit, however, says that the party expects the Finns Party of Finland to suffer a blizzard loss, although the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, much of which will be realised by the right-wing government next spring.
The life span of the three parties, about as large as the size of the government, depends on the ability of the Finns Party to survive.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party had had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermentation status have also surfaced.
The first thing that is obscured by new cuts is the fact that next year they will be carried out drastically and the second is to soften the expected strike on the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the target of indebtedness being reversed during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo’s budget proposal takes on EUR 5.9 billion of debt next year, or more than this year.
After the election, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget run-up.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018, and then in the spring the parliamentary elections will accept what is to come.
These measures do not reduce debt
It is quite clear that the current measures do not stop debt even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it incontrovertibly:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no help from the international economy.
Finland’s national economy has not risen much since the collapse in 2008, except during the resuscitation policy pursued temporarily in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this decade and lengthened from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
With the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice by taking on new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: A lot of tasks to be left to the municipality
Three out of four believe that organizing children’s day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also rolls responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, the province is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the duties of the municipalities in charge of the order are to be transferred to the state.
A young drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist in Joensuu ran a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie on Friday night at halftime.
A police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man went on to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The pursuit continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from there to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster-legged policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The breath test for the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver’s license to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck on a rock truck crashed into a ditch.
A truck on a rock cargo crashed into a ditch on Kölvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9.15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the truck through the door above the fallen truck, together with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the car owner.
Hydraulic oil was poured into the road from the crashed truck, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in Ilmajoki, Lahti, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman about 165 centimeters tall, slender, and well-groomed, with white hair that stretches under the chin.
Observations and hints of lost movements are requested to call the call number of the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The surge that crashed the tents at the Parafest Festival caused massive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially on its feet, and the event can also be organised next year.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the end of Friday night in the marketplace.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances in the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The downward flow is generated in the thunder cloud when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending air flow.
The changes in the shape of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its speed towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the route of the plunges.
The rush flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people slightly injured themselves.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured for further treatment.
Air Pollution Ages Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners ages faster than usual.
The reason for skin ageing is air pollution.
The study is based on the Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyzed London’s air’s most toxic fine particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, say, a fellow person living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who travel their commuting commuting near crowded streets.
London residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution with different masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After getting out of the tractor and going in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor managed to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor did not run further, as it collided with the rocks in front of it.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship League, leaves for the series starting in October for better starting points than for the memory of men.
The team has been together for three weeks.
The common tone can be found with certainty better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as the head coach at Rienno, praises the new team as an enterprising and united team.
Fred Musoni, a middleman of the foreign trio, begins his second season at Rienno.
The new face is Murangwa Nelson, aged 23, and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is similarly a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Josban, Kataja and Riverboys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all the World Floorball Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is in Tampere, only 2013 missed Canada’s better finish in North American qualification.
I was working in Turku and playing with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up the National Floorball Team.
I was interested and here I am, 48, says Jumppanen.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played on the Finnish Floorball level.
The show was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship series 1991-92 with the university, the following three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, the balance was 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The most recent season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to national team
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, an uncle-oriented Finnish gymball club, were raised by Josba, who was selected to join the Finnish national team, who will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, 25, who is attacking in the Helsinki-based lot, has played six men's national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
The 32-year-old defender of the Swiss Wiler-Ersigen, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the femur trouble and is part of the national team's standard fleet with 117 international matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran player of the Seinäjoki Games, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
The head coach of the national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volley champion Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is ending as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish Beach volleyball championships will be decided on the weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in both adult and young leagues.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs of each series rank will be qualified for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Elimäe’s YMCA-grown Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball summit for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to playing games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena in the baseball stadium.
I haven’t played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it’s great to play in the finals at home.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark in sports and gave good snacks to a great hobby.
There are memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine in the E-girls of the Elimäe YMCA.
On top of that, there is an oversized jersey, knee pads rotating on the ankles, as well as huge aces and choreographs after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the action - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the club's chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball in junior age.
The swimming pool has been playing biscuit since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the Juniors Championships myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu is playing together with the kick-starter Anniina Parkkinen at the Finnish Championship Finals during the weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-gold we are still missing from the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The performance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the tournament in Kisakallio.
At least the toe shoes are temporarily put on the nail, Hasu plans.
Flood flow poured tents at disabled event in Joensuu, disaster was near

Two tents were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 5:00 p.m.
Markus Viitaniemi, an on-call firefighter interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that there were ingredients for the disaster.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneur means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli and his younger brother Valtteri Koli started working as a continuation of their homestead.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers through his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into the hand of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I’ve always loved working on a farm, and now that I’ve started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything into play.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done properly and seriously.
In 2013, we started to build a yard barn, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I was very brave to participate in the project and I have been fully involved in it,” says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything would still turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli’s goal is to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has been successful, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for young food producers in Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
He will be eligible to vote on the newspaper's website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading in years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero since last year's October, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% over the past 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost-of-living index was 101.0 % compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, an increase in the price of the following consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages, tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat’s Anime Effect Is Criticized as Asian Caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million users to customize reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple tools that twist facial features, producing more than 30 million selfies improved each day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat’s lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the app promotes blackface, or blackface, or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised to some users this week a lens that gave them slender eyes, slanted teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people -- the yellow face.
And they wonder if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem of diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: Lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly banned the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photos were widely shared, said in her email that the lens was -- at least offensive and uncomfortable --
He added that -- it is difficult to argue against a comparison with the side-by-side outrageous Asian caricature and filter effects --
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme demeanor.
Snapchat is not the only company that goes beyond these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an offensive image of a user, it’s much harder for these guys to be unobtrusive.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed racial disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and ended his writing with a hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
Either they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions of this kind -- Chinese-American Zhu said, -- or they have different skin color representatives at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak frankly --
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and to push forward internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, for his part, that he keeps his Snapchat account closed, adding: “I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay.”
Congressional Panel Says Military Officials Falsified ISIS Intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials from the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces War Area modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than what events on the ground justified.
The interim report, set up by the Republican Chairman of the House Defense Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and a working group set up by the Defense Appropriations Sub-Committee, found — widespread discontent — among intelligence analysts at the headquarters who said that the superiors tampered with their estimates of American efforts to defeat Isis.
The Headquarters, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Results of intelligence accepted by higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than what the facts on the ground justified. They were consistently more positive than analyses produced by other intelligence community factors,” the report’s press release said.
\"Centcom's events are unacceptable - our combatants in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers - Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California,\" he said.
The failures of Centcom’s management reach the very top of the organization.
The 10-page report describes in detail the constant problems with headquarter descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking administration of the Obama administration has ordered reports to be tampered with, it describes the analysts feeling as if Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters' press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves, the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of ISIS.
“After months of investigation, this is very clear,” spokesman Mike Pompeo, a Republican in Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders at the U.S. Armed Forces Military Headquarters manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created a working group after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
A report published on Thursday follows more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector has initiated an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the concluding conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessary isolation process from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces — Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s leading Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process -- prolonged the publication of intelligence outputs -- worsened mood among analysts and did not -- give enough room for divergent perspectives --
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions -- preset or political narrative --
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has begun an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said — experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security —
The investigation has more repercussions than just the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the military activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The review of Islamic State intelligence reflects a controversy more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article that said that, despite protests from several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the insurrection regarding Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, the Hooker group concluded that despite the opposite public statements, airstrikes against refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery, however, was not reported outside the headquarters.
The then-Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators viewed his testimony to the Senate as an overpositive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at headquarters.
United States wins fourth consecutive time in women's field hockey, holding a showdown with Britain
The day after he scored three goals when the team won Japan's 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday when the Americans won India's 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
I have no idea, he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals.
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 position in an Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeaten after winning Japan's 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarter-finals, and this game determines who will finish first and who will finish second in their six-team group.
The first-placed avoid a strong Dutch, the second group leader, for a little longer as the quarter finals begin.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have sparked a stir with their surprising success here, four years after they finished last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvania Blue Bell and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel) joining the national team at the age of 16, when he became its youngest player ever.
He did not participate in the 2008 Olympics because he did not qualify for the final player list.
In 2012, nothing happened to him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
“Culture change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started scoring in the first half with a knuckle bump close to the goal.
India had entered the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at 1-0 until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball for a long time to the left of the field, then toured to the center and threw the ball to the goal, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the tournament's first U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
“We have a good situation now,” Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
The Peace of Trampoline at the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, furious message of competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton transmitted from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the anger between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympic and future heartbreaker with a smile bump, could well be one of the names known to all who are presented at their best times and supported by sponsorship agreements and good-mind TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species as much.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the species that not everyone generally accepts: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few remarks in between over the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russian usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada defend their London gold medals.
Trampoline, however, is associated with a certain charm of the underdog, partly because in the uncivilized ear it sounds better suited to clown school than to the Olympics.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, I am just a fan of flightlessness.
The species has opportunities for ambience, as noted by the vibration of endless bounces of cartoon films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swim jumping, two species that it basically combines.
The word “trampoline” comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions jump on a giant trampoline up to a height of almost 30 feet, and must perform spinning motion sequences (translations, folds and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and flight time.
32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete in Rio.
The most common course of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those wishing for a medal must go further, faster, up and over - sometimes up to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another grotesque border: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and it can even cause the viewer to tears.
But that’s also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
Trampoline offers a moment of rest from here.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, appearing weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, this does not lack competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no fierce rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, only a dreamy, fluid interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to zen space as can be achieved in the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon as the broadcast starts at 13:00 (ET), the men's competitions will also arrive at 13.00 on Saturday.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon programming starting at 14:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering male athletes to stare at and objectify (as the U.S. male gymnasts some time ago suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
A generation protests in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States.
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more regions.
Alone last week, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Spreading videos recorded in demonstrations, believed to be at the end of last year or early this year, show how the security authorities are hitting young people with sticks while being forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations’ chief human rights authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and the West appreciates its stability.
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved enormously, and the capital city of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model for democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government repression, the opposition in the country has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven into the far desert.
But this could be changing.
“If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen,” Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the young people are protesting.
One generation is demonstrating.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition from land use to strangulation.
After the much criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last place held by the opposition, and now holds all seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing, and the struggle along this tense and controversial border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated over the past few years, may try to take advantage of the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter emotions are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and Amharas, get along better with each other.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business, taking advantage of the oromas, many of which are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
“We are on our way to organization under one umbrella,” Oromo director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of discontent and use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
“Today’s government does not have a basic instinct like that,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the Tigres do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in a state of such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested about elections that, according to analysts, seemed like the government was first downtrodden and then robbed.
In the ensuing strike, many protesters died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the country’s internal growing contempt for the Ethiopian government.
And now it is beginning to have a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by tigres, and anti-tigre hatred becomes increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want their allies in the already unstable region to collapse.
This, Abdi said, is a real balancing act.
Donald Trump explains his Obama-Based ISIS claim as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the controversy that took over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he wasn't serious when he several times this week insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were founders of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The study raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a tumultuous period, in an awkward position where they must explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump increasingly argued in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that he really intended to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning Twitter release, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The release was a turnaround from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the charge.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took this into his hearing ears.
The latest storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign in the midst of declining poll results.
Trump and Clinton were fighting over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Fleeing again on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm.
Late in July after he faced widespread criticism apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, \"I guess I'm being sarcastic.\"
The approach allows Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then come back if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then ‘clears’ in one direction or another depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is cunning with his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been more gluttonous in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published Friday showed that Trump is following Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologizing for things he says that provokes, he often accuses his critics of misconception of his words or of misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny over the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I believe there are real, political comments in his words,” Giuliani said when asked about the truthfulness of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton established an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, where Clinton worked as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before the Pennsylvania Friday meetings, Trump continued on Twitter an attack on the news media that grinds his every word and is biased against him.
He mocked —bad, pathetic — television experts trying to find out about him, saying — they will not succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as new evidence that he was unfit for president.
A previously closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the Bedford Avenue streetside was too expensive for it.
The store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup-shaped soaps.
The locals lamented it as the last loss in a city to be renovated to the middle class.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is a change, it’s a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new verb has wifi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same undisturbed atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new site.
He started in the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When the client offered to fund him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and overlays include capers and browned onions, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
No beer is served in the café, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old loyal customers.
“Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers, too,” he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer like this.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into the cafe.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up coffee for a while.
“I realized I enjoyed Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a mixed chai drink instead of his usual ice coffee, one of the new additions.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
“Every day, fifteen or seven or so, regularly as a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagel with butter,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes due to variation, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge against the soap store that took over the old estates.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make Verb a special soap that would use as an ingredient the café's cold-extracted coffee.
“I think we can still take the offer,” Rodriguez said.
And Greenpoint’s traditional Polish residents have also accepted the coffee shop.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to put it up soon at a point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand to the next building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said he was inconsolable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like coming home walking inside and ordering coffee.
“I wanted to smell it,” he said.
A Square Meal: The Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to eat lunch in his office.
As a treat, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras pastry, and Maryland marsh turtle soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert from plum pudding.
“It was a manifestation of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat —
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, released Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By demonstrating some kind of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, undisturbed lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When a reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the depression.
“The mortuaries were very popular,” Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liver loaf, bean loaf.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make your dinner.
Coe mocked.
“It must have felt like lead-heavy in the stomach,” he said.
In the years before the depression, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like eating-so-much-like-jaksat buffet.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived the fact that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
“At the time, food became a central, distressing subject for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mysterious dishes, such as crumbs and boxes, became the main dishes, and the box was — a great way to use food leftovers — mentioned Ziegelma because chefs were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compositions were tried with the amount of calories and nutrient content more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While also doing research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish where fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
“It wasn’t a popular addition to the dinner table,” Coe said.
Ziegelman stated: \"It was unreal.
Peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to start — as budgeters — and to meet the challenge of turning blobs like pureed spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Let Me Eat Cake attitude.
While publicly praising his childhood for simple, Iowan country food, he ate meals like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
“He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in a nearly gilded dining room.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place, not only offering some of Washington's deadliest, but also the worst-made food...
Many of the eating habits in the depression were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, for example, of how she could not throw away food.
“He was really afraid of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, \"He even made people sick.\"
There was a wind-hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
It's called plum foam - Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a showy name.
There was no whipped cream in the dessert, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone willingly sank their spoons into a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe said one time and the other.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, \"a little chopped walnuts could help--
Gilead to be compensated for lawyer costs in hepatitis C patent fight against Merck
A U.S. engagement judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc be entitled to legal expenses incurred in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from payments of $200 million after violating two Merck patents related to Gilead’s successful drugs Sovald and Harvoni. This release followed when an American judge discovered Merck’s malpractices, which included perjury and other unethical practices.
In a judgment on Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensation it incurred in opposition to the action.
Merck tries to catch up with Gilead, who dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of laboratory work on the basis of Gilead’s active substance in medicine sophosbuvir.
U.S.-backed forces say they have completely taken over ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have completely taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing-lipant prisoners held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Allied Forces, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax return, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse's income in that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaker compensation, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for his book, which reported his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Vice Presidential Candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their true federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
Clinton campaign assistant Ian Sams said on Twitter when he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are complete.
Trump critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his transactions, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has addressed the problem, releasing a online video on Friday that highlighted prominent Republicans who urge Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
\"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in recent decades: publish his tax return,\" he said.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times' business columnist quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who said the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, which the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also in the process of inspecting the tax administration, and that Trump is not -- afraid -- a tax collection agency, but voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was an affordable, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported $199,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers boost Tanzania’s elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering to human settlements - they throw animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The method has proved effective, and the idea, invented by the Honeyguide Foundation several years ago, together with the US Nature Conservation, has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use non-violent four-step ways of protecting homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since we developed...the tools, we’ve seen a change in attitude in these communities, and they’re now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include pointing an intrusive elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, the so-called “chili cloud” is thrown.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and with a firecracker, after which the condom is twisted so that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When a condom is lit, it bursts, bursting the chili powder dust into the air.
One flash is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is the trigger, which shoots a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel to remove Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker with a Jewish background unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to requests from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the holocaust documentary Shoah, dissipated his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's hotel in the country's area code list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Kempinski Bristol, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
In the search for an explanation, the filmmaker raised the matter at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from there - shocked him -
The hotel's recipeonist said it was a \"considered decision\" by the management of the Kempinski hotels.
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel’s area code,” the employee said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the case —a great injustice — Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
“We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But even more shame is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This does not need explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, the official said.
The incident produced quite a counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply —gived in — to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
A second publication noted that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm Street stands near a synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what was happening — unobserved — and apologized — to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
“The clear order not to include Israel in the quick dial list was never made,” Kempinski’s spokesman said, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students clashed with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when students gathered to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The problems began when law enforcement officers tried to disperse a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror about the plans.
According to proposals by Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, governor of the state of Sao Paolo, a little under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters set out as a single force to support President Dilma Rousseffi, who was arrested in office, while the country's Senate voted on his impeachment.
RT Business: trade between Russia and Iran is growing 71%
Since the removal of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan said.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies have shown great interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Naturally, one of Iran’s two-way cooperation goals is to expand trade,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to a total of $856 million.
Russia’s exports to Iran, in particular, increased by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
“The increase in trade was achieved with the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries with the highest number of tourists in Russia for the first time.
“It is safe to say that last year’s record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition,” he said.
Scots Callum Skinner plunged into the finish line while British caught cycling gold
Callum Skinner of Scotland ran to glory in a men's team print at Rio Cycling Stadium last night when the UK team's three championed their championship from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, the legend was proud of the young man when he ran to the finish line, catching the victory from the pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock win four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing sixth at the March World Rally Championship in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and the London Games was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a special broadcaster.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's ending also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches were holding on to with regard to the potential in the Scots that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner set an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own round, but Kenny pushed the team to the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and included Hindes driving at a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert, and drew Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes' attention as they entered the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old Glasgow, said, \"The comparison is flattering.
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comment, and Britain's rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no such problem with victory.
Hindes said, \"I felt like I was in London with so many British flags on the pedestal.
As a team, we found contact in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bike sports in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five days in the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (that apparently sacred day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have the total number of medals rising to six gold and one silver.
It'd be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny competes next in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I just enjoyed this one.
Team competition is always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
Winning alone is, to be honest, lonely.
Hindes said, \"If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight.\"
This was the only medal competition of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in time runs in a four-person, four-mile team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London, the 2012 gold-winning world record is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time runs when officials invited him to the length measurement.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and reach a whole host of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and perfect control in Beijing and London, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
The background has been drama, the least of which has not been the resignation of the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April due to charges of sexism and temptation, as well as the end of the race career of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night of competitions at the cycling stadium, it seems that the UK's now legendary reputation for peaking at the perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's Unmelted Future Questioned by Cut in Electricity Contract
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminum smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when a power company distributing electricity to the plant revealed that one of the plant's owners is about to terminate the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the Victorian Government's decision earlier this year that the aid required to maintain the plant will not be extended.
The 20-year period will end in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been caused by the cost of production of the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter at its Loy Yang An plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the meltless physical electricity needs will continue,” he said.
According to AGL, the contracts are the so-called protection agreements, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“That’s why AGL expects the contracts to produce results in the 2017 financial year,” the electricity company said.
All possible results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the wholesale electricity futures market.
AGL said that it has already, in anticipation of the end, reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts — does not affect Alcoa’s ... ability to keep the smelter in operation or to secure unmelted electricity supply —
A US company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was supposed to come into effect in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary not only of the Portland smelter in Victoria, but also of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL executive director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, this is a significant reduction in demand for the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing, he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality star, is on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the fourth daughter of the clan of model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, is on the cover of the desired September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, a brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and modeled at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
“Looking at this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a peculiar (or perhaps just Kardashian style?), a screenplayed reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of their sister, but which ended in a classic twist: they were planning surprise parties.
It is a cliche plot pattern for almost every children’s television series — the birthday episode — (Seacrest utters the lines — you probably didn’t think we’d forget you — with the credibility of a morning cartoon bunny, but Kris had to make his other girls benefit somehow from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved into the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been able to get Vogue's cover first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in its own class.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus were advertising content).
Its cover star's revelation is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more on the cover — celebrities who serve as models — than models who are celebrities —
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as a generation-a success model, would hit the first category, he would be in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or today’s young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner’s success.
In his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be inconvenient.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them -- the bitches of the moment --
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But to spin in discontent is inappropriate.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's make-up cream.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom he took to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he is a reality TV star.
160,000 people are turned away from the Community Legal Centres each year
The most vulnerable of the more than 160 000 peoples are turned away from the Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the Community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centers are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“The Queensland community’s legal centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away every year from the essential services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government cuts funding by 30 percent in June 2017, which means thousands of unprotected residents of Queensland are forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was sued after an employee was alleged to have been threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the campaign's North Carolina action chief was gunning for an employee in February while they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by former state campaign software intern Vincent Bordin at a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said that for months he waited for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing that - it would not happen -
Chief Earl Phillip took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap, Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, said in the lawsuit.
“We don’t need to launch weapons to cause damage,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that — the people of the Second Amendment — who usually include gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and should be allowed to elect judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media has taken his words out of context, and that he is not in favor of violence.
The Bordin challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless surveillance, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond to the request immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlote, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call request submitted to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity throughout the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new internships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, and youth unemployment around the airport will be eliminated.
Just like before the 2012 London Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be put to shame in the face of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and an economic growth of £211 billion, and to leave the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, remaining: T5, voted the best airport terminal in the world for five years in a row, T2, built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway supported by £16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will also be.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and a former Secretary of Commerce at the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games to block ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the anti-advertising program are — cat and mouse play — said one of the companies that manufacture such a program.
Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad inhibitors on its computer pages, Adblock Plus released a blog post that said users could update the program filters to again block ads on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code was being changed around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's been circulating a new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that — this kind of round-trip battle between an open-source ad-blocking community and its travelers has been going on since the invention of blocking ads — and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of how much grief the ad blockers have become for industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a survey conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe. This is almost four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook’s ad revenue.
However, the company is after the ad blockers of the pages used on the computer, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still generate enough revenue to make Facebook consider this kind of action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it would use its daily ad preference tool to give people more power over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also block some of the site's non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss motorway apparently after suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway in the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did — a desperate act — and lay down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, clearly trying to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been interrogated, but not all have yet been identified, police said, urging them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has begun, which is a logical step in a situation like this,” Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, told Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's up to the prosecutor, Hofstetter said.
The two similar cases of the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases -- where both had a person walking on a dark highway -- it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of charges of negligence after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court said.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the emergency call, drove in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was -- a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation -- the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus once inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabited once.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces, and a carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere could sometimes have Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and could still have been spinning slowly.
The model also looked at the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet likely had areas drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographic variation to enable life and to protect from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent fainter sun.
“In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus’ slow rotation reveals its day to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio said in a statement.
This heats the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are actually a few degrees cooler than the current temperatures of the Earth.
The model produced a story of Venus' developmental stages, similar to that previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was likely to be habitable at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gas phenomena - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from Avalanche coach's job
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the actions of Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey affairs, saying the reason for the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president/general Joe Sakic confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have done my duty as Vice-President and Head Coach of Colorado Avalanche’s hockey affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
I have been thinking for a long time and earnestly about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the view of the coach and the Deputy Director-General of hockey matters must be fully aligned with the vision of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick told me today about his decision,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League in his first Avalanche season 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Minnesota knocked Colorado in the first round of playoffs, and the team has not made it to the finish in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the 2015-16 season ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to Wild, losing the western conference wild card playoff slot.
Roy, the chosen goalkeeper for the Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
The North Sea oil workers' labour disputes due to pay are postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service company Wood Group have been arranged occasionally on North Sea drilling platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute,” the joint statement said.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors’ fees by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company’s remuneration follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company said that further cuts would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as the company lightens its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's largest North Sea labour disputes.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
“We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects, while the average for the previous five years has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The most recent mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete listing of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades star cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital times are related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
At its peak rotation speed, these adult stars are hurling large amounts of star wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The most recent list of star rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, the larger of which make pirouettes slower than the smaller.
“In the Pleiades Ballet, we see that slow spinners are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
“The Pleiadian cluster provides an anchor for the rotation of stars into theoretical models that encompass both directions, younger and older,” Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Pleiades' rotational speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
