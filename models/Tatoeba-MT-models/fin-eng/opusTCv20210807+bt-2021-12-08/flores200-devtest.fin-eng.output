This confirms the already widespread theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but additional information was obtained that is not usually found in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
According to the researchers, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown on top and light or carotenoid-coloured underneath.
In addition, the discovery helps to understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a well-developed stem called a stalk, but they do have other properties of feathers — such as barbs and wobbles — researchers concluded that the stalk is likely to be a later stage of evolution than these other properties.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying but for thermoregulation or mating rites. Although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the researchers suggested that the sample came from the plumage of an adult individual and not from the downs of a chick.

The Baker-Hamilton Commission released its report today at 12 noon Greenwich time.
The report warns that no one can guarantee that any action at this point will be able to stop the war between sects, the escalation of violence, or the drift towards chaos.
The report begins by hoping for open debate and consensus on US Middle East policy.
The report hastily criticises almost all aspects of the executive's current policy towards Iraq and calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq's borders from hostilities and restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work done was primarily theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team hoped to detect the effects of the tide between dark matter in the galaxy and dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the gravitational pull of the moon affects the Earth, causing the tide, so does the gravitational pull of the Milky Way affect the Sagittarius dwarf ellipsigalas.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in the galaxy surrounds it as a kind of halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is very worrying and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.
Some patients may have been infected in the hospital, Moll believes, and at least two of them belonged to the hospital's health care staff.
The infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts during the year.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB among all TB sufferers still seems low — 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 infected in South Africa each year.

Based on infrared images, the temperature variations of the day indicate that they are likely caves.
They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface during the night and warmer.
Their thermal behavior is not as steady as that of the large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it fits in with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Astrogeology Task Force and a teacher at the University of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally not been a high-tech activity: voters lock themselves in a booth and place on an envelope a pre-printed sheet of paper on which they have marked the candidate they want.
After the authorities confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law has determined the course of events with comparative precision.
In 1988, ballot boxes were ordered to be transparent so that voters and observers can prove that there are no envelopes in the box at the start of the vote and that no envelopes other than officially counted and authorized votes are added to the box.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the series of events. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under close supervision and following prescribed procedures.

In her second race, i.e. the big slalom, she reached 10th place in the women's seating class with a total score of 4.41.30, which was 2.11.60 slower than the first-placed Claudia Loesch in Austria and 1.09.02 slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dan in Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's seating group were unable to finish their count, and 45 of 117 skiers at Giant Slalom did not receive a ranking in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh police found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Superintendent D.K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped a Swiss woman and found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused have been announced as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused had appeared in the courtroom with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed when emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first taken to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
He is in custody awaiting prosecution and trial, but eyewitness evidence may be corrupted, as his image is widely published.
This practice is common in the rest of the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently, and courts have held that the publication of images may be detrimental to a fair trial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists do appear to be balancing dangerously if they publish photographs of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, the Scottish prosecutor's office with overall responsibility for the charges, has given reporters the impression that there will be no further comment on the matter, at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to run the way they did before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed were reportedly the future status of holy Jerusalem for both nations and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is calling for a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of the agreement, which the Palestinian Authority will only accept for five years.
The rangers were to closely monitor the shooters participating in the complementary control experiment on pests, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
Qualifying volunteers were recruited as a joint project of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Association of Sports Shooters (NSW) and as part of the shooting association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director for Parks Protection and Cultural Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shootings received comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Martelly recognized nine members at yesterday's meeting of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
A delegation appointed by the President last month recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The delegation was Martelly's response to the large-scale anti-government protests that began in October.
The demonstrations, which at times became violent, were triggered by failed elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
Overheating of malfunctioning iPods has been reported in about 60 cases, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economic Affairs and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the ministry announced that Apple had told it about 34 other cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the investigation "really unfortunate."
The Marianas were hit by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday at 21.19 Greenwich time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported that there was no indication of a tsunami.
Former Filipino police have held Hong Kong tourists hostage for hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with an M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman when she needed to use the toilet. Mendoza died under gunfire.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and went into medical practice.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth during his idle time.
His studies showed that administering the hormone speeds up the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that an official research team found two black boxes, or flight recorders, on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A rather unique case like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 respondents was conducted prior to the federal elections in 2010, and the number of those opposed to becoming a republic in Australia had increased by 8% since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of the Department of Supply, argued that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled shared his views and wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extreme end of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic champion was scheduled to take part in the 100-metre and 200-metre freestyle and three relay races of the Commonwealth Games, but his condition has been uncertain due to the pain.
He has not been able to take the medicines needed for pain relief, because their use is forbidden in the games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people confirmed the discovery by early February with various devices and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have brought water to Earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are born, and especially how the Earth was born, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political jaw-lashing and ridiculous."
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, saves millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduces carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older, ground-based technology, enabling controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be arranged and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are also no parking and access parking facilities available at the venue.
Concern over the lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to play behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University and Uppsala University reported that the new species had evolved in two generations, although the sequence of events had been thought to last much longer, due to the mutual reproduction of the native Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the alien cactus (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into small objects.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and can be attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used in hand-painted images in books called "book paintings".
This is called the pH value of the chemical. You can make the meter yourself using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (i.e. alkaline) the substance is.
The amount of hydrogen ions (pH H) in the tested chemical shows the pH value.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean and wet hands.
The moisture in your hands reacts to the outer layer, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
Almost every house in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushable toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in Greek Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where women and men bathed in the same facilities at the same time.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space aboard a rocket, and scientists are using telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and our view.
To take a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket that is over 100 feet long.
The bike has changed the world in incredible ways. Much easier and faster movement is the biggest thing the bike has done for us.
It has given us a train, a car and many other means of transport.
Beneath them come the more average-sized felines, which feed on medium-sized game from rabbits to antelope and deer.
Then there are still many small felines (including stray pets) that feed on small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds, whose numbers are much higher.
The secret to their success is the so-called ecological compartment. According to this concept, each cat has its own specific function, which is why it does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cat animals, and they live in large groups called herds.
The herd consists of one to three adult males related to each other, and sometimes as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related, forming sisters and daughters of a large family.
The lion pack behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs. These animals are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cat animals), and they are also very dangerous for their prey.
Tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not very well), swim, jump far and pull five times as strong as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same genus of large cats (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. Only these four cats know how to roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but more like a phrase made up of grunted, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, preying on apes, snakes, rodents and birds if they can catch them. Almost all of the animals that Ocelot preys on are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find edible animals, i.e., by the smell of prey, sniffing the ground where they have passed.
Ocelots see really well in the dark thanks to night vision and move really unobtrusively. They hunt by blending into their surroundings and then plunging into prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) are separated from the main population from which it comes (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or to a new island, so that it is not easy to move back), its environment is often different from before.
The resources of the new environment are different and the competitors are different, so in order to be a strong competitor a new population needs different characteristics or adaptations than before.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, over time it begins to look less and less like the main population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, each population looks so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which only means the emergence of a new species. speciation is a necessary consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe in, and they use carbon dioxide, which people breathe out.
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants, we make clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The mosasaurus was a great beast of its time, so it feared nothing more than other mosasauruses.
It had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth sticking out of its long jaws, in addition to which it had an extra row of teeth on its palate, so nothing that hit its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a branched tongue, its diet included turtles, big fish, and other mosaics, and it may even have been cannibal.
Even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex wouldn't have made it.
Most of their food would be familiar to us, but the Romans also had their own quirky or unusual feast treats, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called a walnut mouse.
The second difference was that the poor and the women ate their food sitting in a chair, but the rich preferred to have a joint feast where they would sit on their sides while eating their meals.
Meals in ancient Rome could not serve the kind of food that came to Europe only in later centuries from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of God.
The people brought offerings to the gods and the priests sought to meet the needs of the gods with ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, the so-called Most Holy, to which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers were built in temples, called zikurats.
The top of the tower was God's special sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not as important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard, and the shops were mere open sales tables along the streets, using stone as the building material for the houses.
The land of Canaan did not have extensive forests, so the tree was extremely expensive.
The Norwegian sagas said that Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived on the island at that time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that the treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, because even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The inscription is upside down at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote them, but it is known that a large parchment document (its dimensions are 29 3 to 4 inches by 24 1⁄2 inches) was rolled up in the early days for storage.
So it is likely that the entry was only added as a name tag.
D-Day, or landings and subsequent battles, had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was held by the so-called Vichy France, i.e. the French, who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders rather than fight them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1944, codenamed Operation Drago.
The US and Free French forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and turned toward Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is common to a large group of people living and working together, to society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civilian or citizen. It is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen or subject, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and it also kind of defines the size of society.
The city-states are the precursors of the nations. Civilizational culture refers to the transfer of knowledge from one generation to another, to a long-term cultural footprint and to a greater distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving the necessary historical evidence, so they are generally not considered proper civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - the only part of which was Congress - on the basis of the Articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it had to rely on the often uncooperative authorities of the states to enforce all of its statutes.
Nor did it have the power to change tax laws and interstate customs duties.
Changing the articles required the unanimous approval of all the states, and the states were so overbearing with the central government that often their representatives were not present.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world, winning the World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in them even in international matches and the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Since the islands of Japan are in a bouquet or as a group, Japan is often spoken of as an "island" in a geographical sense
Taiwan began to be known as early as the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed past mentioned the island under the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, at the same time initiating a change in indigenous grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers for their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Dynasty in 1885.
After being defeated in 1895 in the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: these are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better understanding of their original appearance.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common size used in still images in the world is 35 mm. It was the predominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still being produced, but above all, the image sensor formats of the digital camera have inherited its aspect ratio.
A little confusingly, the size of 35 mm is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this size (divided by twelve to give the simplest size ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS format family) either match or are very close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and much mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline to create dynamism in the image while still maintaining some order.
According to it, the most effective place for the main object is at the point where the lines dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds intersect (see example).
In this era of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be looked at closely.
Christianity had united European states for over a thousand years, despite differences in languages and customs.
Its all-pervading power affected all, kings as well as the common people.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's financial resources are intended for just such use.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money led many to question the realization of the doctrine.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off the vital supplies of soldiers and civilians, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international treaties over the previous two hundred years.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire ocean areas and posed a danger even to neutral ships.
Since the tactics only provoked limited reactions, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine war.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and states were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations decided to avoid a similar situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with four cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous supervisor) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of describing different periods of time: each stage of China, or each family in power, was its own dynasty.
In addition, there was an unstable period of provincial division between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the 60-year period of the three kingdoms between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many nobles fought frantically in pursuit of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of people died fighting for access to the highest seat of Xi'an's mighty palace.
There were many social and political consequences, such as the introduction of the metric system, the transition from autocracy to republicanism, the idea of nationality, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, posts were also opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true for the military, because military values were now based on capability rather than class status.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working classes of other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things outside of everyday life. He often visited a meditating cave, which became known as Hira and was located on the light-signifying Mount Nur.
The cave itself, the time the tooth left alone, creates a very vivid impression of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located in one of the mountains to the north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's very hard to find even if you know it exists, and once inside the cave, the isolation is complete.
You can only see the clear, beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave you can see or hear very little about the earthly world.
The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, houses several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), several small tombs, several temples, and the Giza Sphinx.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures made in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign of the rising bow looks like the letter V and the sign of the descending bow is like a rivet or square that lacks an underscore.
Rising spring means you should start with the tip and push the spring. Falling means you should start with the fross (the one you hold the spring with your hand) and pull the spring.
The rising spring usually produces a softer sound, the descending spring is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to add your own markings with a pencil, but remember that printed suspension marks are on sheet music for musical reasons, so they should usually be followed.
A mob of working women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elisabeth of Versailles back to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They came back to Paris in a carriage as the crowd surrounded them and shouted threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages completely.
At some point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a bodyguard killed in Versailles in front of a shocked queen.
The Filipinos themselves had to pay the war costs of the conquest of the Philippines to American imperialism.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial government to cover a substantial portion of the cost, and to provide interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
The basic benefit of American imperialism, of course, consisted in the huge profits made from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos.
To understand the Templars, one needs to understand the background against which the organization was born.
The era of events is usually spoken of in the Middle Ages, a period in European history between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1300.
The Cardiac Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which are generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice covers a wide range of ideas from the so-called technological thrust, i.e. the necessity of technology, to the absolute notion that human destiny is guided by logic based on scientific laws and their expression in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two basic ideas in common: first, that the development of technology itself follows a route that is largely beyond cultural and political influence, and second, that technology, in turn, has inherent rather than socially conditioned "effects" on societies.
As an example, one could argue that the invention of a car inevitably leads to the development of roads.
On the other hand, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Mass ownership of cars results in more accidents on the road, leading to the invention of new health care methods to repair damaged bodies.
Cultural determinism was a major element in Romanticism and was drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was considered to shape individuals. Over time, customs and culture typical of this geographical location took shape. Since these were in harmony with society, they functioned better than arbitrarily enacted laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe in the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world.
Its reputation as the center of luxury began around A.D. 400 and continued until about 1100.
Its status deteriorated in the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders had returned home with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the supply of the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the turn of the 9th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication routes, Western European styles could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. As one of the most significant developments of the era, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes with the Crusades.
Self-sufficient farming is farming where enough food is produced only to support the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficiency is a simple, often organic system that uses natural seeds for the ecoregion, combined with rotational farming or other relatively simple ways to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel rejected by society's norms and thus are able to develop their own identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, place and/or gender of members.
Characteristics that define subculture as their own and distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender or sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
Often, members of a subculture communicate their membership with the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and their own slang.
One of the most common methods of demonstrating the importance of socialization is to use as an example the few unfortunate children who were left without socialization as they grew up as a result of either neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse.
Such children are called "wild". Some children have been isolated by people (often their own parents). In some cases, the rejection has been due to the fact that the parents have rejected the child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Some are said to have been raised by animals, some are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
If a wild child has been raised by an animal other than a human, he or she will behave (within the limits of his or her bodily limitations) in almost exactly the same way as his or her guardian animal, for example by showing similar fear or indifference to humans.
The purpose of project-based learning is to make learning easier and more interesting. Timely support for learning (scaffolding) goes one step further.
Ladders are not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be both virtual and real. In other words, the teacher is a kind of ladder, but so is the small paper clip lock in Microsoft Office.
The virtual ladder is built into the software and is designed to ask questions, give prompts, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the learner without anyone's help.
Children are placed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educating, but some live.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
The purpose of our foster home system is to provide a safe home, loving guardians, a steady education and reliable health care.
The purpose of children's placement is to meet all of their basic conditions that they lacked in their previous homes.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specifics of the Internet mean additional dimensions in the case of the use theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important influences on the use of the Internet (James et al. 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new perspectives of influence when studying audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, or facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it has been argued that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, described how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage, however, are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that some animals, such as domestic dogs, may have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
20th century research has shown that there are two stocks of genetic modification: latent and manifest.
The mutation adds new genetic variation, the choice removes it from the store of manifested variations.
With each generation, differentiation and recombination shift variation back and forth between the two stocks.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human will find it difficult to get enough amino acids from the plants available in the savannah.
In addition, the absence of them has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition and, eventually, death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins from leaves and pea plants, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest them without cooking.
In contrast, animal-based food (ants, termites, eggs) is easily digested and, in addition, provides a rich supply of all proteins containing essential amino acids.
Thus, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" in much the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
A sleep interruption is a deliberate awakening during a normal sleep period and falling asleep again a little later (after 10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, which restores consciousness but does not wake up completely.
If you find yourself turning off an alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as a diuretic) before going to bed, when you are forced to get out of bed to urinate.
The amount of inner peace in a person corresponds in the opposite proportion to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive is his life force. It is possible for everyone to find complete peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but an understanding of the Mahayana, or Great Path, and many techniques of Indian yoga were added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and develops awareness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which is why the Soviet Union and the United States cooperated. After the war ended, clashes of systems, procedures and cultures led to the countries breaking apart.
Two years after the end of the war, earlier allies had become enemies, leading to the Cold War.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the war was actually fought, with replacement armies fighting on the battlefields of Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Poland's defence had already broken down by 17 September 1939, and the only hope was to withdraw and regroup at the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced to the country and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after attacking eastern Poland, contrary to the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that its own country retains the ability to move its own people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy mostly tried to block this traffic with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain just like the rest of Europe.
The goats appear to have been domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to wear them to easily obtain milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually raised as herds that roamed the hill country or other pastures. They are often cared for by goat herders, who were often children or young, such as the more well-known sheep herders. These herding methods are still in use today.
Wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways consisted solely of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses to pull the carriages faster and with higher loads than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
The track ties were introduced quite early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually understood that the tracks would be more efficient if they were to be covered by an iron strip.
The practice became common, but iron consumed the wooden wheels of the carriages more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron tracks were introduced.
The first known form of transportation was walking. People began walking upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (i.e., a vertical person) developed.
The preceding Australopithecus did not walk upright as constantly.
Bipedal specialization can be found in the 4.2 to 3.9 million-year-old fossils of Australopithecus, although the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can become more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering somewhat.
This is often like treating the symptoms of a disease, but if we do not want a mere temporary solution, then we should find the roots of the problems and remove them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of mankind's scientific and technical advances, and the problems have grown because of overpopulation and mankind's wasteful way of life.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten copy signed by congressional chairman John Hancock and secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printery a few blocks away.
During the night, 150-200 copies, now known as Dunlap's open sheets, were printed.
John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who gave it to his troops in New York on 9 July, and one copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap open sheets known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs have survived and are still alive, we call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like tyrannosauruses.
Virtually all computers currently in use are based on processing data encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. either 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers — or, in the professional language of computer circuits, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Vomiting-like symptoms are so common that diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The surest indicator of internal poisoning is a visible, opened medicine jar or container containing a toxic household chemical.
See the label for the first aid instructions for the poison in question.
Entomologists use the term bedbugs actually for this group of insects.
The term derives from the fact that in ancient times bedbugs have been very common. Bedbugs are insects that are well adapted to human parasites.
Beastly bedbugs and bedbugs are both nest-delayed, adapted to life in their master's nest or cocoon.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the most common neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have a double tendency to develop multiple sclerosis compared to men.
The couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples may choose to draw up an adoption plan for their infant.
In adoption, biological parents waive their rights to parenthood, allowing the other couple to act as the child's parents.
The main task of science is to use scientific methods to determine how the world works. The scientific method guides most scientific research.
However, it is not only the making of experiments, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science were accepted, including in the field of psychology.
As the Greek language declined in the West, it lost touch with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physique and behavior often depend very substantially on the existence of innate cycles and their emergence by means of biological clocks.
Seasonal rhythms, which are not merely reactions to external seasonal stimuli, have been found in most living creatures such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to circulate freely for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's research was one of the most important indications that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to plant their own DNA in the bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either marking the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important a part of the genome they have affected, and whether they have affected germ cells or other cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting nature sites for the purpose of enjoying the scenery, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities at the destination include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and getting to know information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting the Borneo orangutans, learning about them, and photographing them.
Every morning, residents of small rural towns take their car to work, and others meet them, whose job is where they left.
In this kind of dynamic shuttle service, everyone is somehow connected to, and at the same time supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that a huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, there are rarely as many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport planners just incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, as drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave in a relatively uniform manner, so traffic flows tend to have moderately good consistency and can be presented roughly mathematically.
In order to better describe the traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the following three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Understanding these relationships helps to plan, plan, and maintain roads.
Insects were among the first animals to take flight, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and companions more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backwards against their bodies.
Thus, they have a wider range of small places to hide from the beasts.
Dragonflies and daisies are now the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite, i.e. that the entire Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, with over 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, 6 miles at its widest.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into our planet's oceans comes from the Amazon.
The length of the actual Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles), collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size or construction skills of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, who were already well over a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the smallest in terms of population.
Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Most people working in the state also speak Italian as their everyday language, but Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known common chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they all occur in nature as themselves and because they are also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a combination of one or more elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter — solid, liquid, gas, and plasma in the same order — but he also theorized that they change into other substances to form what we see.
Metal alloys are basically alloys of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are counted as metals, but there are also metals like gold and silver.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that they could fit into the ending point of this sentence by trillions.
So for many, the pencil was a good friend when it came to the market.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods have evolved, the value and uses of the pencil have become more ostracized.
Today, messages are written on the computer screen, and you never have to hobble the sharpener.
One can only guess what happens to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The fission bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus consisting of many protons and neutrons.
A bit like pushing a heavy cart uphill, splitting the core again releases another part of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which is why they tend to break apart with little or no nudge.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called its shell.
The thickness of the Moon's crust is about 70 kilometers on the visible side of the Earth and about 100 kilometers on the reverse side of the Moon.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more dark sea areas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are primarily concerned with investigating what is behind people's behavior or what appeals to them.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they grow up.
These theories look at why some people want what they want, and what things in their environment cause them to do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are popular content theories.
As leaders begin to lead their former peers, in general, two different behaviors can be formed. At the other end of the scale is an attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or sock).
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, keeping discipline, evaluating performance, sharing responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the scale, a person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels he has to change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the group.
Such behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same level of quality as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members act as contact persons for their immediate physical group.
They often have more decision-making power than regular team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones and their local administration may not always understand this.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, 109) is also one of the unique elements of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which all members report. The invisible team determines each member's requirement level.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing systematic learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, a process in which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders need to create an innovative culture and share knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) describes a continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, which is why it narrows the field of study and makes it much more exact.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that various brain lesions, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain psychological functions.
The proliferation of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of information technology that studies machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research attempts to get machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent operation.
Examples include supervision, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
These have become segregated disciplines focused on providing solutions to real problems.
Today, AI is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and national defense just as it is embedded in a number of software applications for home computers and video games.
Class trips are an important part of teaching. Often the teacher would like to take the students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The technology provides a solution, i.e. virtual field trips. Students can view museum objects, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in a desk.
Sharing a class trip virtually is a great way to reminisce about it and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at the North Carolina Bennet School design a website for their trip to the state capital. The website is renewed annually, but its old versions are kept online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. In the early stages of a student's blog experience, grammar and spelling are often sloppy, but the presence of the audience usually changes the matter.
Since the students themselves are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to take the trouble to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to hitch better the world around them". The need to feed the readership's interest to inspire students to be witty and interesting (Toto 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can allow students to be more analytical and critical. By actively responding to materials on the Internet, students can define their position against the background of other people's writings, as well as bring out their own perspective on the question at hand" (Oravec 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, with a rich array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Farther to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is, among other things, the pristine, scenic Muskoka.
These and many other factors create an impression of Ontario as a place considered by outsiders to be the quintet of Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Indeed, the following demographic comparison surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are citizens in Canada at all.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of them and, by nature, is like its own continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or part of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and it got a lot of wind under its wings in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel in the north and the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women - All female travelers, regardless of their actual marital status, are recommended to say that they are married.
Using the ring also helps (as long as it doesn't look too valuable.
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause what they may experience as harassment. It is not unusual for someone to follow suit, grab by the arm, etc.
Be strict in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't make advances justified!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by the Berber fishermen, and was used by both Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port, which they called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-ul-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of Morocco's least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places in the old medina where traditional Moroccan products are sold, such as tagines, clayware, leather products, hookahs, and a wide variety of trinkets, but all of these are meant for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and buried most of its streets, especially in the city centre.
Goma is reasonably safe, but all out-of-town excursions require prior investigation in North Kivu province to determine the current status of the ongoing fighting.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, where you can also find some of Africa's cheapest mountain gorilla trackers.
You can use a boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) fare is about 500 Congolese francs for a short drive.
When this is combined with its relatively inconvenient location, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a symbol of exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
It was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 due to the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the most important stops on Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country because it has more of an Arabic than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered to the east by Mozambique, to the north by Zimbabwe, and to the south by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different nature areas, each of which supports a variety of fauna and natural plants.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
The park is subject to a daily conservation and admission fee, as is the case in all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card to access either some of South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is the main destination for many tourists.
The procession of buildings forming the Hong Kong silhouette has been compared to the glittering column chart that is best shown in the water of Victoria Harbour.
You can see the best of Hong Kong by leaving the island and heading to the Kowloon Harbour area across the street.
The majority of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is located on a crowded fillet of land on the north bank.
It was this place that the British colonial masters took possession of, and if you look for signs of colonial history in the area, it is a good place to start.
Sundarban is the largest mangrove forest area in the world, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the outback of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarban has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on the Indian side is called Sundarban National Park.
However, the forests are not mere mangroves, but include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungles that once covered the entire Ganges Plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, about a third of which is covered by water or marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, with an estimated 400 Indian tigers and about 30,000 axillary deer present.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those to the east and to Jakar and Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Since buses within the area are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Small Japanese Coaster buses run to most of the counties, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Group taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a slanted-rope bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes of three and a half meters wide.
The bridge has an underpass height of 15 metres. Construction ended in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to the timetable, the bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, when the border stations in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous groups living in what is now East Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters, but also engaged in subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes lived in the Chaco area, such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, who got along by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "the giant province of the Indians", was born as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples of the country in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three hundred years.
Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for being one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo courts.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen in other seasons.
The Argentine polo federation provides news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is pegged to the equivalent of the pound sterling (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley is also often accepted by credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the outer islands, although the currencies of the UK and US may be valid.
It is almost impossible to change the currency of the Falkland Islands outside the islands themselves, so change your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 degrees are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively chilly: the temperature rarely drops to the side of frost, but the combination of wind and humidity makes the air feel colder than the thermometer reading.
There are no special rainy seasons or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials advise staying at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meter away from other wildlife.
Bisons, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack, although they may look very docile.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, please note that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or preparing heavily scented foods and keep the camp tidy.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port experienced a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships — German, American, and British — refused to leave the port.
All of the ships sank except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost at the same time.
During the Mau movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the death of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a lot of sandy beaches, because Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are located in three different areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Coast and continue from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and pohutukawa trees give shade to most.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in the port of Waitemata in the wealthy districts of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are sometimes congested family beaches, and the coastline is bordered by a good selection of shops.
The main local beer is "Number One". It is not a multidimensional beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are several French wines to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better preserved on the way.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but careful people will find bottled water easily.
The idea of flat white milk coffee is alien to Australians. A small black coffee is known as espresso, and cappuccino is served with a large amount of whipped milk instead of frothy milk. Tea is served without milk.
Cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are pricey but excellent.
There are many trips to the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare on the reef.
So heed the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Cubic jellyfish are found north of 1770 near beaches and estuaries from October to April. Occasionally they can also be encountered at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and are likely to swim away from the site.
The estuarine crocodiles do not actually live in the sea, but their primary habitat is the river deltas north of Rockhampton.
The passenger gets peace of mind when booking in advance that they will have somewhere to sleep when they reach the destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, but it may also be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also keep your reservation valid if you need time to consider an offer or obtain other documents (e.g. a visa) for your destination.
However, any changes and requests should be directed first through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp in the area, and most attendees consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the events, you need to arrive on time to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even after the music performances on the main stages, there may be places at the festival where the music continues to play late into the night.
Some festivals have separate campsites for families with children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea during the winter, check the location of the cabin, because passing through the ice causes very terrible noise in the worst parts.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos typically try their best to maximize the time and money customers spend. There are usually no windows and clocks, and it can be difficult to find exits.
They often have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep customers in a good mood — and in the casino premises.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house tab; however, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying clear.
Anyone intending to use cars at high latitudes or in mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or extremely cold temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction, and you can't drive the same way you would on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, there can be so much snow in a very short time that the car gets caught.
Snowfall or snow flying in the wind, as well as moisture or ice accumulated in the vehicle's windows, may also impair visibility.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic usually runs year-round without interruptions.
Safaris are perhaps Africa's biggest attraction and a highlight for many to visit.
Popularly, the word safari refers to land-based travel designed to view Africa's magnificent fauna, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and the usual equipment is well enough to watch them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari, and hiking) means either a few hours or several days of hiking.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 25 September 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight or accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, your situation can be tricky.
Cancellation policies vary, but based on the situation at the end of March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 330,000 yen, with tickets usually costing around 7,000 yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help them dry out. Many hotels have the option of borrowing irons and ironing boards even if they are not in the room itself.
If an iron is not available or if you don't particularly care for ironed socks, you can try a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (as it can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for one minute, in other areas several minutes are needed.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have any doubts, you should consider buying water from a reputable company in sealed bottles.
Tourists may come across pests they are not used to in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, spread poison and infect diseases.
Actual infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are usually not counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping refers to the possibility of buying products that are exempt from excise and sales taxes in certain places.
Tourists heading to countries with heavy taxation can sometimes save considerable sums of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is dominated by the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, as it repeatedly runs in remote forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay alert: there are many steep climbs and descents, narrow lanes and steep bends.
The prescribed speed limits are considerably lower than those for earlier and later sections — usually 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 kilometers per hour) — and compliance with them is even more important than usual.
Oddly enough, cell phone coverage is much better here than in many other places along the way, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds area.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite bulky and versatile, reminiscent of those of southern neighbor Austria.
Fruit pastries are common. Apple pastries are made year-round, and cherries and plums are popular fillings in the summer.
Many German pastries also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often taste particularly good with a strong cup of coffee.
If you are looking for small but sturdy pastries, try one called either Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices together with either meat or vegetables.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a top concept, covering a wide range of regional food cultures across the country.
But if the concept is used without further definitions, it usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javan cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and includes a large selection of simply flavored dishes. Javanese favorite flavors include peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javan coconut sugar) and a wide variety of aromatic spices.
The stirrups are the rider's footrests that hang on either side of the saddle.
The rider gets more stability from them, but they may be accompanied by safety concerns because the rider's legs may cling to them.
If the rider falls from the horse's back but the leg is caught in the stirrup, the fleeing horse may start to pull him after him.
First of all, most riders wear high-heeled riding boots with a smooth and quite narrow bottom.
Some saddles, especially English ones, have a safety bar that allows the stirrup strap to come off the saddle if the falling rider pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley - Chilean climbing site number one, known as Yosemite of South America. The valley has various large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, with climbers from around the world continually forming new routes to its endless walls.
Ski sports, such as downhill skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where snowy ground is lowered by skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important tourist activity, and many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums, plan entire holidays at a particular destination around skiing.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers have been done already in 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called wilderness skiing, ski hike or excursion skiing.
It is related to alpine skiing-style hiking or mountaineering, but it usually does not include such, since the latter is practiced in steep terrain, and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can progress somewhat faster than on foot, but you will only very rarely get to the same speed as when skiing on maintained trails and without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but there are many independent countries, and under normal circumstances, to travel through several countries would mean completing visa applications and passing passport checks several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions somewhat like a unified state.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo passport control again.
Once you have a Schengen visa, you also do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen member state individually, saving you time, money and the hassle of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which prefabricated goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define all goods more than a hundred years old as antiques.
The definition varies according to geographical location. For example, in North America, newer objects are counted as antiquities than in Europe.
Handicraft products may be defined as antiques, even if they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture associated with it is also important for many practitioners of other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sámi have participated in large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and similar livelihoods and considered reindeer mainly as draught cattle.
Nowadays, many Sámi work in modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income in Sámiland.

Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the threat of dangerous weather affecting the travel destination as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone wishing to visit a country that can be interpreted as a war zone should receive professional training.
An Internet search for the condition "A Course in Hostile Environment" will likely give the result a local business address.
The course usually covers all the topics covered here in much more detail and usually combined with practical experience.
The course usually lasts between two and three days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning a gender reassignment surgery abroad should make sure they have valid documents for their return trip.
The authorities' willingness to issue passports that do not show gender (X) or update documents to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign authorities to respect these documents varies just as much.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not had surgery should not expect to survive security scanners while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are the reversible flow of waves that break ashore, often found in reefs or similar places.
Due to underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper parts, and there may be a rapid flow into the deep water.
Most deaths are the result of exhaustion when trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught by the current again, or depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, it may be wise to wait for rescuers.
Return shock strikes earlier than culture shock (the habituation phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Tourists who found it easy to adapt to a new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their own home culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the customs of your home culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding in knowing that travelers need to get used to the new country.
People may not realize that patience and understanding are also important for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show of the pyramids is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and before the show starts you can see them in complete silence.
You usually hear the voice of tourists and peddlers, and the story of light and sound is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is the background of a long story and its narrator.
Scenes are shown against the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated.
Many states have claimed the Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, and have the most bases. In 2020, there were sixteen active bases.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers to the north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled crater of a still-operating volcano serves as a staggering natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is an area bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea south of the peninsula.
There, the peninsula mountains merge with the plain and then emerge again to form the 360-mile-long Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Mountains, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, or the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak being Mount Vinson at 4,892 metres.
In remote areas where mobile phones do not have coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, because to make a call you have to be outside and keep unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used in shipping, including by yachts. Similarly, it is used by expeditions that need remote connections of data and sound.
Your local call center provider will probably be able to provide additional information about connecting to that service.
Travel and learning is an increasingly popular option among those planning a gap year.
It is particularly popular among school leavers because they can take a year off before going to college without having to suffer from their education.
In many cases, attending a gap year course abroad can even improve your chances of continuing to higher education in your home country.
Typically, a course fee is charged for participating in these tutorials.
Finland is an excellent boating destination. In the land of thousands of lakes there are also thousands of islands, both in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes, you may not need a boat the size of a sail.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are big enough for any boat, smaller boats or even kayaks provide a different experience.
Boating is a common leisure activity in Finland, with boats for every seven or eight people.
The ratio is the same as in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise very rare (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
Most of the actual Baltic Sea cruises include a longer visit to St. Petersburg.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few days and still return to the ship for the night to sleep.
You do not need a separate visa if you are only going ashore on excursions organised by the ship (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not previously flown or experienced something traumatic.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it does not differ from many other people's own fears and disgust for some other things.
For some, some understanding of how the aircraft works and what happens during the flight may help to overcome fear due to ignorance or a sense of helplessness.
Transport companies are well paid for fast deliveries; often speed is very important for business documents, merchandise or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
Larger companies have their own aircraft on some routes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, on some routes the unloading and customs clearance of the cargo could take days.
The only way to get the goods through faster was to send it as checked baggage. Airlines regulation does not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, so at this point you are needed.
A self-explanatory way to fly in first or business class is to pay a big chunk of money for this privilege (or perhaps rather let your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: according to a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the price for a business class compared to a tourist class and eleven times the price for a first class!
For direct flights from A to B, it is generally not even worth looking for discounts for business class or first class seats.
Airlines know that there is a certain core group of air passengers who are willing to pay a fortune to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

In addition to the more common species, rare fauna such as bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and woods can be found there.
Women visiting monasteries should wear skirts that cover their knees, and also their shoulders should be covered.
But if you bring your own scarf, especially the brightly colored one, you may get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.

Most modern research telescopes are huge installations and are located in remote regions where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, or hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 7th century.
The idea came from China, where the most popular flower was the Japanese pricoce.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom festivals only for himself and other members of the aristocracy who are influential in the imperial court.

Non-believers and non-Christians from Christian countries around the world have also adopted many traditions related to the festival.
According to tradition, Easter night is spent awake in some open place to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often deliver the Passover night mass on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend. The congregation often breaks out to celebrate the midnight hour to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Because the mainland was very far away, mammals could not survive the journey, so the giant tortoise became the main grass-eating animal in the Galapagos Islands.
Since man arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in the winter, you will experience a polar night when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
