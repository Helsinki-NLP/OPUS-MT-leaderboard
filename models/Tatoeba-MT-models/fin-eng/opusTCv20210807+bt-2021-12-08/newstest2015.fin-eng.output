The City of Juankoski will join the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
The city council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal merger, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue as an independent municipality.
Kuopio and Juankoski will decide on the next municipal elections separately.
Municipal elections will next be held in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111,000.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe in Tokyo, to discuss economic and security relations, on his first major foreign visit since the May election victory.
Modi's five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economy.
At the top of the discussion are plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India is also said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political talks with separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct a substantive political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that pro-Russian separatists, who Kiev and the West say are aided by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian forces away from their current locations, where Putin said Ukrainian army forces are shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get a chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area," Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at the Grocery Shop.
It was a surprise that people were coming in early in the evening.
The visitors were as expected during the two days, says promoter Tom Kangas.
The Seinäjoki Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year again.
We are still going to be a hip-hop festival, so pop is not going to be allowed, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law that restricts the acquisition of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives enters into force on Tuesday.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Board for permission to purchase or possess substances or mixtures that could be used as a so-called starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Hydrogen peroxide can be found in cleaning and detergents, for example, but the concentrations do not usually exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used in acceleration driving, for example.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster Accused of Hotel Rape in Nairn and Pitlochry
The defendant, accused of rape in two hotels, faces a trial.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges at a hearing before the Glasgow High Court.
He is charged with rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in the province of Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman "while she is unconscious, asleep, and thus unable to make a decision for herself."
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands, Nairn, on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with Judge Lady Rae's decision, the trial will be held on 17 November in Edinburgh at the High Court.
Premier League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he is considered the hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Liverpool, strengthened by Mario Balotelli, arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a completely different attitude than in Manchester City.
Balotelli was still far from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality finishes and pitched only half of his sixteen assists to his own team.
Pool supporters who have already favored the player expect better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers instilled Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the team's second striker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team's star was Raheem Sterling, who poked a 3-0 win over Hugo Lloris's important opening goal.
Sterling, 19, doesn't just shine with his power.
The Englishman, 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli, is between the opponent's lines than a fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who is speeding on the grass at a speed of around 34 kilometers per hour at best.
Rodgers also deserves great credit for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told how Liverpool have systematically developed the North West Londoner, who grew up at the foot of Wembley, into a more comprehensive player than just a winger.
Susanna Mälkki was chosen as Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälkki as the next Chief Conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from autumn 2016.
Newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, have asked which orchestra he will take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will start in her new role with joy and pride.
The Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra has played a central role in the music life of Finland for over a hundred years, for example by performing a large amount of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been conducted by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with great enthusiasm," he says.
Employees' organisations' administrations meet in pension negotiations - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
A new momentum is being sought for the pension negotiations today from the social partners' own gatherings.
The SAK, Akava and STTK administrations deal with the negotiation situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to continue.
Labour market organisations have been chafed, among other things, by the dispute over the binding of the retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by the autumn, but the latest estimate is that it would be created during this week.
Clamppudas.
Woman Volley, a women's volleyball league team from Rovaniemi, tripped over the athletes of the league Vampula in the finals of the training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula scored five 3-2 wins in one extended match.
WoVo lost the final round 15-11.
The neighbor was always one step ahead.
The fight was good, but in the defense and passport game Vampula was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyrö.
The WoVo spruce was ragged in that the six-foot-tall American center Jennifer Keddy had her back stuck in the side.
The center was played by Sara Niemi.
Despite her thumb injury, Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play and formed WoVo's most firepower combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as a picker, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of Vampula was a skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo toured as much as possible.
WoVo's preparations for the league will continue next weekend when Hämeenlinna's HPK comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "shop" at 6 p.m. in the official practice game.
On Sunday, we will meet again at the sports school.
Lidl beats wild numbers in Finland
The net sales of the company's stores in Finland grew by almost 25 per cent to nearly 1.2 billion euros during the financial year that ended at the end of February.
The company announced its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and the expansion is planned to continue.
Lidl also said that he paid nearly 14 million euros in taxes to Finland in the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer deaths are more frequent in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers reviewed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Principal investigator Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers went through seven years of women's health history.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous medical conditions, and socioeconomic status also contributed to the chance of survival.
In older women and with cancer more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not attempt to determine why women living outside of cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan sees delayed diagnosis and complicated access to treatment as possible reasons.
"Gynaecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," Jordan says.
Although remote care is becoming more common and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programs to support patients far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographic location, highlighting the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The study, funded by the charity Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother living on the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its snowmobile parking operations in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the Hotel Pohjanhovi.
The City Board decided on Monday that the City Plan proposal for Friendship Park and its surrounding area will be publicly displayed at the service point Osviitta.
Statements on the plan proposal are requested from the Environment Board and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the city plan change, the city wants to enable the continuation of tourism-related snowmobiling activities in the area.
A park area is to be formed on the site, containing the current Friendship Park and the area between it and the river.
According to the show, a maximum of 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available between 15 November and 30 April.
Refueling points may also be placed on a designated part of the area.
Maintenance traffic is also allowed in the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area to safari companies for snowmobiling use during the winter.
The lease was last renewed in spring 2014 and the contract is valid until spring 2018.
The sled parking activity and the change in the pattern have raised even loud opposition.
Residents of neighbouring blocks of flats have been annoyed by the sound as well as worried about emissions.
However, emissions in the area have been investigated, and observations that exceed the guideline values have not been identified in the surveys.
The renewed equipment is also less emission-intensive than the old one.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the starting point was moved further away, the hotel's safari customers would have to be transported to the starting points of the safaris by buses, which would have an estimated 15 departures per day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area of the Friendship Park is also sufficiently wide for sleds, better than places presented as alternative starting points, such as the eastern side of the Ounasjoki bridges next to the boat dock.
The Friendship Park is good in terms of its location, also because the activities can expand to the Ounaspaviljonki area in the future.
The consolidation of parking operations is part of the city strategy approved by the Rovaniemi City Council, according to which the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business by reserving enough high-quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point for snowmobiling in the sub-general plan of the city centre, which has not yet gained legal force.
The fall in owner-occupied dwellings is visible in garden stores
The decline in the number of homeowners, especially in the under-35 group, may lead to a tens of millions decrease in the turnover of garden stores as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales by age.
According to a report by the Financial Times, homeowners spend only 55 percent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study had also shown that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden is decreasing as the front yard is increasingly paved as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be worth about £5 billion per year.
In the Greater London area, home ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, with the lowest per household spending on horticultural products across the country.
However, according to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in housing rental or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the RHS's chief garden advisor, says that "plants grown in mobile growing containers, for example, are particularly popular with homeowners because such growing containers can be included in the move if necessary."
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period for retailing in the horticultural sector, as home ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, after last year's March and April weather was worse.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat over spying report
The Turkish State Department has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomat to provide an account of the report on spying by Americans and Britons in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. embassy's affairs officer and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept have written that leaked documents by Edward Snowden, a former analyst for the National Security Agency (NSA), reveal that Turkey was the main target of espionage by US and UK intelligence agencies.
Turkish news agencies said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the significance of the report, saying that all the major states have been spying on each other.
An earlier report of espionage directed at Ankara by Germany's main intelligence service generated an angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze to appear in new Finnish film
Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze, who appeared in several successful films, has been cast as a female lead in a new Finnish film.
Croze will play director Mikko Kuparinen in the film 2 nights into the morning, with filming starting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for his role in The Barbarian Invasion in 2003.
He has appeared in Steven Spielberg's Munich and Julian Schnabel's Butterfly in the Glass Dome.
The lead actor in the 2 Nights to Morning movie is Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will premiere in Finland in September 2015.
Majorcan Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
Those who made the case presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià, located on the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by shop and bar owners in the Magaluf area, known for wet partying.
Chief Superintendent José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several shop owners on Punta Ballena Street filed corruption charges against him, with most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs located on Punta Ballena Street.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, those who reported the incident presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià city government officials at the Mallorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with the corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The country-wide daily ABC wrote that nightclub owners were angered by the bias of the authorities, which significantly hampered their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one business owner told the court.
You will not destroy our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video appeared online, in which an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during a so-called pub crawl.
Since then, authorities on the island have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrollable behaviour of Magaluf's holidaymakers by reducing the number of participants in the infamous, alcoholic pub crawls.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and pub crawl organizer Carnage were jointly fined €55,000.
Above all, the so-called balconing trend has also become popular among young British tourists in the tourist resort of Magaluf, which has caused a number of accidents caused by alcohol consumption when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer under bomb shelters as rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day Israel-Hamas war and schools remained closed as the region recovered from the fighting.
The opening of the schools caused joy and excitement in the rocket-bombed communities of southern Israel, but traces of the fighting are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, in the Pashosh daycare, workers removed fragments from the walls and slides before the children arrived after the rocket struck the daycare.
"We're a little bit scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a city school.
Many children living in this area are in dire need of routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, feels that coming back to school after a long time is "a little strange".
"We've had some difficult times where we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Prior to the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of residents of Saad-like border communities had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza front are skeptical about the return after a Palestinian grenade killed a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, more than ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools so far.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city near the Gaza border that was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "children's education and safety will be taken care of."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas' call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea roads.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the number of dead, saying that at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it has not had conclusive evidence of this.
Sixty-six soldiers and six civilians were killed on the Israeli side, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades into Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli military, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled to shelters in more than 100 UN-run schools that had been turned into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still under shelter and fighting continued, school officials postponed the start of school the week before.
"I hope the school opens soon and we get back to school, just like other children in the world and just like Jewish children," said 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a shelter in a school in Gaza City.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen most in seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index, which measures housing prices in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1% in August, RP data revealed on Monday.
As a result, prices rose by 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as high as in the 12 months prior to August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Research Director at RP Data, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data results show that house prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the year before.
The Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin housing markets are the next busiest; the average price increase is between five and six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4% per year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that began in Australia will increase the number of homes available for sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"Given the increase in the sales of homes to be auctioned, the generally brisk sales pace and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that house prices will continue to rise over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and visual arts have drawn record-breaking audiences to Mänttä this summer.
The Serlachius Art Museum has had more than 70,000 visitors by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum opened in June and has exhibited classic works of pop art from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, among others.
Mänttä Art Week, on Monday, said it had set a visitor record when 14,500 interested people had visited the Waiting event this summer.
These numbers are not used to.
People have been knocking on doors and windows," says Director Pauli Sivonen from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to Serlachius Museums this year will be close to 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located halfway between Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always phenomena when they open.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä, it is hoped that the art season will continue well into the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will open at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani over the past few days.
On Sunday evening, a window was broken into at Pohjolankadu commercial property.
The perpetrator had received a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, fuel from a truck tank had been stolen.
On the other hand, a boat with outboard engines had been taken from the Petäisenniska marina between Sunday and Monday.
The rowing boat was Kalapalta-branded light on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, it read "OIVA" on the front.
A couple of suspected thieves were already caught by the police.
On Sunday evening, a commercial property was broken into on Tikkapurontie.
A police dog got a mark and a Paltamo man in his 20s was found in the woods hiding under a tree.
On Monday, police picked up another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected of committing the same burglary.
Missing amphetamine brought murder charge in Kajaani
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamine brought a murder charge against a Kajaani man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had entered the apartment with his cohabiting partner and another man and fired a shotgun at the owner of the apartment, a 34-year-old Kajaani woman, who was suspected of being a drug exporter.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man was the shooter.
The incident came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a passenger car in which a party was smoking clothes used for blood work.
In addition to the burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
The Kainuu District Court will issue a judgment on the matter at a later date.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, an equally warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature was higher than usual in the whole country.
In most parts of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the heat in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born to seven children from a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, British Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently training for Rudy's Rare Records, a comedy show based in part on a fictitious conversation with his father and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap at an upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother's death, and he thinks a lot about his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only a voice said: Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer tank or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about that sort of thing.
For most of my life, he was to me the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley, giving him an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although working conditions are now better than they were at the time.
Melthouses are a bit brighter these days but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthine depths with flashes of flame, smoke, and soot, reminiscent of Hades.
Dad used to go to the bath and just lie in the tub, and slowly he started singing to himself as he washed the dirt off the smelter himself.
As I walked around the smelter, I realized that he had been doing that work for years to get us food on the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the closeness offered by his parents.
My father never hugged me and never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started getting sick a little before she died that we started repeating to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, and through her own child has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to repeat "I love you" all the time?
Stop hugging me already!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why don't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why aren't Dawn and I friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to her mother's death.
When I began to suffer from heavy overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a turnaround.
After that, I started exercising a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce symptoms.
It's very difficult...
and boring.
Nobody enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard perhaps describes his change during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is immersed in making theatre.
Next up were Comedy of Mistakes and Fences by August Wilson ("The Fences").
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the industry when he was only 16 years old as a factory worker.
One DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent show.
Henry's TV career began in the mid-'70s. "For quite some time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned while doing his job.
I had to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to produce jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living a life of stardom and being on television.
Lenny New Faces talent show in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where the characters performed in black make-up, so Henry ended up as a comedian on the show for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and disapproving, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to handle the audience.
Still, "British TV's award-winning, perennial favorite and light entertainment show" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people".
In the 1980s, Henry worked on another comedy series that both made jokes and admired black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy show Chef!
Henry spent the next decade working on commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and film parts, but after his 2008 BBC show LennyHenry.tv, he said to himself, "What are you going to do next, Len — now it looks like you're just pedaling in your place or going off the rails."
Next up was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught to us properly in school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wears tights and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's subject instilled fear in me.
All the people we interviewed on the show — Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench — said to me, "Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Date words and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recited 20 verses from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost felt like a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little background research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was ultimately a success.
It was apparently expected to fail, but that did not quite happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry starred in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was acting in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, the thought came to me, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there was a technical problem with the play, and Henry clearly felt it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was fixed.
I walked off the stage, and part of me sighed with relief.
It is not my duty,
I can leave it to others to deal with.
"You're part of the play, stay in the role"
Henry "Fences" at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for the "Fences" play was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more resilient.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do".
This, of course, is what Henry says in the KUME voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: the little chicks of humor interrupt our conversation constantly as he switches from one impersonation to another.
Abstaining from a stand-up comedy is a matter of will, as getting instant praise from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you constantly crave it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when I feel like it, but in general it doesn't excite me the way it used to.
I'll ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit down with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the entire journey, and I don't think I'll ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like the acting...
It's really fun.
There is a story constantly told in the acting, and that's the role I enjoy.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya prepares register of officials to remove 'ghost workers'
Kenya has begun drafting a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from government payrolls.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive pay, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid after leaving office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to root out public sector corruption after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, wages and other financial misconduct by "ghost workers" cost at least $1 million a month.
The government suspects that salaries will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left office, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reported from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must register themselves in the next few weeks at the identification centers to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric form of registration, the government said in a statement.
According to the release, anyone who fails to do this without a proper reason will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, because it will determine how many people actually work in their jobs, and it will also clean up payrolls at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of 'ghost workers'," says Anne Waiguru, an official in the Cabinet of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The result for the financial year 2015 of Seinäjoki may be in deficit by EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure development in a tense economic situation.
Based on the current budget preparation, the annual margin is set to remain at around 9.4 million.
Possible ways to improve efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, as well as purchases of services, sales of assets and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenue.
Of the EUR 10 million qualifying target for investments, 8.5 million is in total.
There is no relief for the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, increasing unemployment and a 5% cut in central government transfers further weaken the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The city government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be turned to the target set in the strategy, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the submitted proposals for further preparation by the management team.
The City Board's proposals form the basis for budget preparation at the Council's Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the council seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through a panel discussion to the City Board and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested on suspicion of "scheming" against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "anti-government plots," local media sources say.
Police officials did not comment immediately.
According to the Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officials were among those arrested.
Some police officers were involved in last December's corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organizing a wide range of crime and monitoring telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as prime minister during that time) said the actions of the police were part of the planned action against him and others in power by Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told expectant reporters that not all schools have reopened, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first of September ceremonies were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in all of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
All of Ukraine, the entire huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, a leading teacher at Slaviansk School, where Yatsenyuk's daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
Celebrations on the first day of school include traditionally children's embroidered shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas' Perry says libelous tweet was unauthorized
Texas Governor Rick Perry's verified Twitter account posted a defamatory photo of a Democratic district attorney in the middle of hearing allegations of abuse of power on Sunday night.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by a new tweet in which Perry vowed he had nothing to do with the image.
The tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I've deleted it," a later publication said.
Perry's backup did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified Twitter account, it is unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet included a defamatory cartoon of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry blocked funding for Lehmberg's post when he refused to resign, leading to a grand jury rally in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The headline of the tweet read, "I don't always drive drunk, with three times the permissible per mille... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing the finger."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio who was assigned to the position by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the accusations a political ploy.
His influential legal aid team has asked the presiding judge to dismiss the charges, saying that the law under which the longest-serving governor of Texas is charged is unclear when mirrored against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in government subsidies to the state's Public Inviolability Unit, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision prompted a left-leaning monitoring group to file a formal complaint.
Perry's verified Twitter account is updated regularly — and sometimes famously as well.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election meeting during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to end the tie by posting a photo of himself jogging around the lake on Twitter with the text "Here I come, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says housing market is 'normal' again
One of London's most important developers has warned that the South East England housing market has "returned" to normal activity levels.
Housing in the capital London has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases while fearing a widespread credit bubble, prompting the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley, a high-end developer, said Monday that "since the start of the current financial year, the market and the number of deals have returned to normal since the 2013 peak," adding that this has allowed for a "stable operating environment."
The London housing market went well during the recession as foreign investors flocked to the capital.
According to the Land Register data, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the previous year alone, thus clearly exceeding the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7%.
Average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable, and student buildings rose by about a fifth the year before, reaching a £423,000 increase by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London real estate a less attractive destination in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "manor tax" ahead of the May general election.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter loan regulations, would lead to a lower level of market growth in terms of both property sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
Recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans fell in July, suggesting a cooling housing market.
Real estate agent Hamptons International has lowered its 2015 forecast for real estate prices in London, saying that prices will fall by 3% as the index measuring homeowners' opinion on prices has already begun to decline.
The number of transactions made in London's most expensive areas of Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter year-on-year, according to real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, which increased the income from the properties sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, right kind of product in the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained high."
In June, the company said it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, almost a third more than at the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Year-on-year pre-tax gains rose by 40% year-on-year, thus reaching £380 million, and net sales increased by 18% to £1.6 billion.
Pidgley said Monday before the company's annual meeting that Berkeley's earnings for the year are in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the full year is £450 million.
Berkeley's stock sold steadily on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon for £23.96.
Hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence nude photos online
Jennifer Lawrence attends the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claims to be in possession of 100 other star photos leaked nude photos of Oscar-actress Jennifer Lawrence online.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games star confirmed that the photos are authentic and condemned the hacker for "a blatant invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone who posts Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The images, which were originally released on the 4chan photo release page, had apparently ended up in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple's iCloud storage system. The list of 100 other stars being hacked claims to include dozens of other female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not known how much of the photos are genuine, though Scott Pilgrim v. World star Winstead condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those who look at the pictures I and my husband took in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are FALSE, don't you understand".
Let me put an end to this in the first place.
BuzzFeedin announced late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
We're the only ones to have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "j"
They dissolved, it best described what happened, gradually they came apart like a cardboard box left out in the rain.
Only occasionally did he hear from the woman that he was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps also a little prickly.
Then he waved his hand.
He recognized the prickly one.
Yes, he was prickly, like a hedgehog.
The latest victim of his spikes had initially been a relationship that had, however, been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have even brought some substance to his life.
Ailinn Solomons had untamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north that was even more barren and farther from everything than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older traveling companion, who Kevern assumed to be her aunt. The aunt had inherited a house in a damp but paradisaic valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place as their own, the garden grew weeds resembling giant cabbage heads.
The cottage was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Narrated by: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Prize for Literature in 2014.
Nominations will be announced next week
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken patio chair amidst long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening distractedly to the receiver through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news as Ailinn's crossed, suntanned feet brought to Kevern's mind a song sung by a long-forgotten black performer and often heard by her father's möh.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned - nothing was actually banned - they just weren't played anymore.
They wanted to be left in oblivion, like the word oblivion itself.
Public opinion accomplished what laws and bans had not achieved: just as in literature people chose to read memoirs, cookbooks, and romances of heroes, in terms of music they preferred ballads.
In the wild of the day, Kevern began to play a fictitious piano and sing serenad to Ailinn's big feet with a cheeky comic voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, while naturally lifting two fingers in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the letter "j" escaped from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father said he played the same game with his own father.
If you uttered a word beginning with a "j" and didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't a fun game now either.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard of such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned either, it just wasn't played.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room in life for one "if".
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to wit.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was the wit presented through music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Jr. by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinni that Fats Waller was black.
Given Ailinn's age, it was likely that she could not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Here, too, there was no need for laws or coercion.
The obedient society meant that each of its parts gratefully — gratefully, thankfully — accepted the principle that each group did things inherent in it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with Afro-Caribbean ancestry are best suited to entertain and play sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally from the Indian subcontinent, they were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so their job was to make sure that every family had a working phone that was used to run errands.
Those who remained of the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East whose grandparents had not fled swiftly for fear of being accused of blazing flames and fearing that those flames would next catch up with them, opened restaurants serving labneh yogurt and looked down on their lives.
Let each one act upon his gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the hurtful words Kevern had just sung could ever have been dressed up as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe in the opinion of the bigfoots.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the illusion of security.
No word would pass through the soundproofing of leaves of giant cabbage head plants.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was funny to Dad," he said instead.
Ailinn shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's field of vision.
Nothing to see in the whole world but Ailinn's huge, crow's-black hair bush.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but did not sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my feet that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to correct the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different because he, like his father, lacked the persuasive charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of his sweet eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from his terrace chair and at the same time knocked over the receiver and spilled the wine they had just been drinking.
Even the wine was made only of elderflowers, so he could not use it as a cause of collision.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like the leaves of a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is what perversely attracts me to you," he said...
Except I don't feel that way.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both because of his own, unnecessarily cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the icy northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it had been the same as life here.
The same huge, icy sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, though even paler and diabolical after the EVENT than their smuggler and disperser grandparents, wandered from pub to pub, ready to hit any woman who dared resist or tease them.
Thick head?
He'd still see a fat fist if he wasn't careful!
Suck first — kissing had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver — suck first and then attack.
Kevern thought that too was too much, as the sucking itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomons' body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the deck chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but he was surprised by the depth of Kevern's grief.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn watched him go — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go through the upstairs window — a man who was himself the cause of his heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he thought.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
A man who had turned his back, bent down, ashamed, beaten, and had lost all will to fight — why did he feel that the sight was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember having seen such a thing before this moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the Private Institute for the Measurement of General Opinion in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the persistence of low and medium violence in those areas of the country where a reduction, or even an end, of violence was most likely given the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"A great deal has already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to smooth the natural aggression of a people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in those deserted and remote places where, despite the towers of the church that extend over the hedgerows, human kindness has been seldom known over the ages.
However, some things cannot be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the cravings it generates.
The people weep over sentimental ballads, devour tales of triumphant adversity, and swear by the virtues of marital and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban cohabitations in its unremitting grip, and there is also evidence of a new, more vicious will to quarrel in homes, workplaces, streets, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatize," his director commented after reading the full report.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her eyes to the ground.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme continued to plead his right not to answer personal questions.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I'm against atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
Prejudice is not maintained in this workplace.
We are the servants of an open-minded society.
While a certain type of hypersensitivity is perfectly acceptable and respectable in itself, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, the kind you just presented to me.
You clearly have something against the Church — and what you call cruelty or evil-souledness, others usually call inherent energy and physical strength.
Saying what happened, if it happened, as if it happened yesterday, if it happened at all, destroys the country's fundamental vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingo-pink LED light proclaimed a guideline Ofnow had been distributing to the country for a quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile at your neighbor, value your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, chat, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
"Speaking is better than silence and a sung word is better than written, but nothing beats love."
"I understand very well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, as she was sure that her director had finished, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the same mistakes that originally led to WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED.
True, this time we will not pour out our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "describing as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their 'hate and distrust on others'."
A person in a position like yours should not have to be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'us' or 'them'.
There was no 'us' or 'others'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we're being completely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured on, "no group in society can say they've behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
We don't need to talk about it any further — that's what we agree on.
And just as it is unnecessary to distribute accusations, so there is no need to make corrections, whether they are valid or not, and even if there is some way to make them.
But what then is the past for if one does not learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go over your report," he said, indicating that it was time for Esme to leave.
The next day, as usual when he went to work, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "evil-souled and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army denies planned attack; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho army officials have denied staging an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they were acting against a police officer suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of state traveled with his family to neighboring South Africa after he said he had received a death threat.
Major Ntlele Ntoi, a spokesman for the army, denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to a threat from "political fanatics". Police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's armed forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause trouble," he told the Voice of America news agency.
According to Clayson Monyela, spokesman for the South African government, the army's actions looked like a revolutionary attempt.
"While no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be in all respects consistent with the hallmarks of a revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to Lesotho army officials, the soldiers will return to their barracks on Sunday, and there was a calm atmosphere in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane says he believes he is being targeted because he has tried to fight corruption.
There has been tension in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to disagreements with the government of the Grand Coalition.
He thus denies that he has devalued the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Kauppalehti: Microsoft to establish a data center in Uusimaa
Microsoft, an information technology company, has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, a location the company refuses to specify.
In a statement sent to media by Microsoft, the company says it will not disclose the location of all of its data centers for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the center is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been the site of the centre.
Microsoft is shutting down its Oulu office completely, which will take about 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will lay off a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft's communications director, says the company will not comment on how many employees the new data center will employ.
The establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa was reported by Kauppalehti on Monday.

Four tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or video underwater, you have a variety of device options to choose from.
The most affordable option is a water-resistant, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost around $300.
I personally took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each costing less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that are worth following.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are waterproofed.
In addition, set the camera's shooting settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of camera and camcorder have a setting to optimize the shooting conditions underwater.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras can only withstand depths of 5 feet, others can withstand depths of up to 50-60 feet.
Check out both standard and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital camera reviews.
Take several pictures - many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose images, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and image composition can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forking, which means taking multiple photos at once with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface while shooting in the pool, lake, or ocean.
This will also give you more colors for your images; the deeper you go, the fewer colors you will see.
Try to get close to the target being filmed.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important underwater because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, meaning that the photographer must be close to the subject in order for the subject to fill up the entire frame of the image.
China won't let Hong Kong elect its leaders, protesters vow revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday decided that Hong Kong voters will not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 election despite growing unrest calling for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to spark long-awaited protests on the Hong Kong business block after activists began planning and implementing protests just hours after the decision was published.
The Chinese People's Congress's decision gives virtually communists the power to weed out any candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it's still infuriating," says Democratic Party chairman, lawmaker Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that it would be too "chaotic" to stand as a general candidate when electing the leader of Hong Kong.
Since 1997, when the UK ceded Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised residents in the region that it would be allowed to choose its own leaders from 2017 onwards.
Chinese leaders said Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through an appointment committee administered from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, Hong Kong held some of the largest and most prominent protests in the region in years.
The pro-democracy campaign was largely driven by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which organizers have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong's main government buildings.
In the demonstration, the organizers of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and they would create waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide the details, apparently fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement online, the organizers said that the movement "considers the Occupy Central rapture as a last resort, to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way."
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has failed and the capture of the centre will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were tough near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that the residents are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
There is also the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are disappearing under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten the lifeblood of Hong Kong — the business world.
"The protest they're talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts," said Regina Ip, a lawmaker who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want there to be any growing concern that Hong Kong is slipping out of our grasp.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
There have also been stories in the Chinese state media that Hong Kong's democracy activists are henchmen of the revolutionary Western powers."
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region.
US prom tradition hits UK universities: private jets for new students
We are excited to meet the demand by establishing Britain's first luxury class mode of travel for today's students.
In addition to the private jet, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect to the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their possessions across the country in fully loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today's students with the easiest and highest quality transportation possible to the university.
According to the company's spokesman, reservations have not yet been made because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start placing orders in the next few weeks."
The company believes there is a demand for the service, although most students pay £9,000 in tuition fees.
Today's students are very different in terms of their expectations and wishes than those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. It is now more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is just the way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticizes the service, which is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice president of the organization's higher education section, "this service plan seems to be very far from the life of the student majority."
Many who begin their studies this month are shocked by the level of living costs, as the financial aid available in the form of loans and grants has fallen behind the huge rise in basic living costs. Only next can we start to think about where to find thousands to use for something as simple as arriving on campus.
Ipswich's "pighouse" for sale
Real estate agents removed the sales photo of the house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig was lying in the living room of the house.
The one-bedroom house, at a cost of £120,000, is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head on the couch.
According to real estate agent Connells, the pig in the picture is the owner's pet.
"However, the image ended up in the ad accidentally, and it has since been removed," a company spokesperson said.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom house."
Even though the real estate agency has removed the image from its website, it still appears in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest on social media, where it has been asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.
Torres' departure confirmed, Kagawa returns from ManU to Dortmund
Spanish forward Fernando Torres' departure from Chelsea was confirmed, but the replacement entered with almost the same door opening.
Chelsea announced that they had signed a four-year contract with French tip Loic Remy's neighboring club QPR.
According to press reports, the purchase price is EUR 13 million.
Torres, 30, moves to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal.
He moved to Chelsea from Liverpool with a record £50 million four years ago, but never lived up to expectations.
Japanese player Shinji Kagawa's unsuccessful trip to Manchester United also came to an end.
Kagawa is expected to return to Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga, where he made his breakthrough before his ManU transfer.
According to press reports, the purchase price is approximately EUR 8 million.
Kagawa's new deal is a four-year deal.
I wanted to make my dream come true in the Premier League.
Now I'm happy to be Dortmund's man again.
This is a great team and a wonderful environment," Kagawa said.
The second bundesliga club in Berlin, Hertha, is strengthened by Salomon Kalou.
The Ivorian national team striker will move to Hertha from French Lille, and the transfer is estimated at around €3 million.
Before Lille, Kalou, 29, played 2006-12 for Chelsea.
Eight dead in Paris apartment building explosion
The death toll rose to eight on Monday after an apartment building explosion in a suburb of Paris.
Eleven people were injured in the crash in the suburb of Rosny-sous-Bois on Sunday, four of them seriously.
Rescue workers were still searching for survivors in the ruins of the house on Monday, but hope of finding survivors waned.
The initial cause of the explosion is suspected to be a gas leak.
The explosion occurred early on Sunday and was so powerful that it shook buildings within a radius of over 100 meters.
Our whole house moved: we trembled with fear.
The explosion was so strong that our ears were ringing," said Maryline Yyvon, who lives next door to the crash site.
An emergency shelter for the residents of the house was erected in a nearby school already on Sunday.

Bulgarian prison staff hold national protest
Hundreds of prison workers across Bulgaria protested in front of the Sofia Ministry of Justice.
In a peaceful demonstration, they declared that they wanted back the old working regulations, which were recently amended.
Salary increases are also to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Prison officials have been symbolically protesting against new working hours for a month, saying they want to return to the old 24-hour shift system.
Despite a meeting between representatives of the Prison Workers' Association and the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached on the matter, according to the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are ongoing, Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate for the Enforcement of Judgments, told the BNR.
Members of the Ministry of the Interior Workers' Trade Union are also expected to join the protest by the Prison Workers' Association.
Basketball: Fans' encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin nearly fainted on the pitch
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finland's victory today.
He was able to forget his black-and-white U.S. match and beat Ukraine in the second half with his blood-stopping solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I was going to faint at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, there was nothing I could do.
The noise and the white sea of crowds was almost too much for me.
Salin's power moments held nine pinnacles at a fast pace, ball grabs, records, and temmels everywhere that happened.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into such a flow state that everything worked out.
They just come from somewhere, now to an insanely important place, Sasu raved.
That's my role.
Doing all that.
Now it was great to see that others caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team's joymonger and spirit-creator, so it's no wonder that his example put the whole team on a flight that was too much for the big and hard-hitting Ukrainian five.
Finland at the World Cup after 32 years: The previous ones reminded me of an outrageous referee game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's head coach at the 1982 Argentine World Cup.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team last played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer at the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where legendary Reino Kosonen was Finland's second coach and current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as if it were yesterday: it was a hot match against France in the preliminary round.
"In the decision-making balls of that match, the refereeing game was glaring," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already put themselves on the back line.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that, the shit went crazy more," said Parkkali.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finished 17th.
Now Finland is once again among the world champions, as the World Cup in Poland kicks off today on Saturday.
Many things have changed drastically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The strength values of the players are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster," thought Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland's player material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I look forward to Finland getting through the first half.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen estimates.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a winning match against Tunisia.
Current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope this is the 17th spot.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," said Parkkali.
Reino Kosonen was the second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotion at the Buenos Aires Seamen's Church were part of the national team's program at the 1982 World Cup.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dog got into trouble in the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
Over the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once again.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog with him in the mountains on Thursday injured his paw.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk on steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a bit forward, but its legs just didn't carry it," Mikkelsen writes in his update.
Mikkelsen said no help was forthcoming from the police, a nearby hotel, or passers-by.
By nightfall, the situation was beginning to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited Norway's highest mountain, Galdhøpiggen, and headed to their camp site when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," Antti Soini tells Ilta-Sanomat in a message he sent.
Soon, a German man with a camping mattress also arrived.
From the mattress, Cita was given the stretcher-like ones to which the injured dog was attached.
The German man came a moment after us, after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope in his arms for a while, Soini says.

The dog was carried down with the help of a camping mattress.
According to Soini, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying on difficult terrain was slow.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still searching on Facebook for "international heroes" so that he could thank them once again.
The Soins responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes," Mikkelsen rejoices.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I would like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the credit and credit, and I will be forever grateful to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soins were already on their way home.
They had received happy news from Mikkelsen: - Cita is reportedly feeling better already!

A genetic anomaly is often misdiagnosed
A British woman feared death for years because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought for most of her youth that she only had a few years left to live because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It refers to a group of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because so little is known about them.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motor skills such as muscle weakness, awkward walking and toe curling.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain, and is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really low survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and would die before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that "as a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and took longer than everyone else.
I was never able to roller skate or skateboard with the other kids, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he underwent several Achilles tendon surgeries to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgeries, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers, which said that he was suffering from FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA association," he says.
When I learned from them, I was shocked and in a state of panic.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I turned 25, and in between I would slowly lose all of my ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his walk had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something a lot less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When they explained to me what CMT was, I thought I'd been put off," he says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to draw attention to the illness.
100 migrants found in coal car in Macedonia
Macedonian authorities have found more than 100 illegal immigrants on trains carrying coal, the country's interior ministry said on Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The migrants were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was difficult to communicate with most of them.
They didn't know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Interior Ministry spokesman Ivo Koteski.
According to police, the migrants had paid about €3,000 each to get to Greece, and another €800-900 each to get to Serbia.
Illegal immigrants travel through Macedonia, a country of a few million people, on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.
Guardian: Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai support Scottish independence
Pop groups Franz Ferdinand and Mogwai have joined supporters of Scottish independence.
According to the Guardian, the bands will star in a concert in Edinburgh in a couple of weeks to support the independence project.
A referendum on Scottish independence will be held on 18 September.
In a statement, Mogwai said the vote was an opportunity for Scots, which only happens once in a lifetime.
In the past, Sean Connery has expressed his support for independence.
British stars Paul McCartney and David Bowie, on the other hand, have appealed to the Scots to remain part of Britain.
In Gallup, supporters of independence have been at a loss.
The difficulties of department stores continued in midsummer - Domestic news - Ilta-Sanomat

Areva has delivered an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to Teollisuuden Voima TVO.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach plot to Bottas - value about 60,000 euros
The municipal government of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot from Villähde to formula driver Valtteri Bottas.
The municipal government showed fair sportsmanship and was unanimous in its decision.
There was no gravel noise at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syyrakki.
The Bottas gift plot has the farm buildings - a total of seven pieces.
The municipality will remove them this year, with the exception of one.
Bottas has promised to build a holiday home on the property within two years.
We are honored that he has enjoyed his birthplace and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools annually to tell about his sports career and life.
And hopefully it will continue, the mayor says.
The municipal manager estimates the monetary value of the beach plot to be between 40,000 and 60,000 euros.
The beach is shallow and child friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Throughout the decades, Nastola has with varying degrees of success kept sports-successful with the help of gift plots in the municipality.
Aki Parviainen, the world champion of javelin throwing, and Tuuli Matinsalo, the world champion of aerobics, received the detached plots from the municipality and built the magnificent detached houses.
However, they did not stay in Nastola but sold their property and moved away.
Parviainen and Matinsalon came to Nastola after work and then moved after the life situation changed elsewhere.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and his situation is different, Syaraki says and believes Bottas will stay in his home municipality.
Hull hired striker Hernandez for a record amount
Premier League club Hull invested the club's record amount in the acquisition of Uruguay national teamman Abel Hernandez.
Hernandez will transfer to Hull from Italian club Palermo for £9.5 million, or about €12 million.
The contract is for three years.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and made it to the Italian main league.
He has scored seven goals in 14 games for the Uruguay national team.
In last summer's World Cup final, Hernandez came in two games for a switch to the field.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull said he also acquired Senegal national team captain Mohamed Diame from West Ham.
Russia's Space Experiment Failed - Geckos Sent on Sex Trip Killed
Five small geckos sent into space by Russia have died, according to Roscosmos, the Russian Federation's space agency.
The Gekos traveled aboard the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning Finnish time.
The purpose of the experiment was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless state.
One male gecko and four females participated in the experiment.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
The effects on the geckos can be used to predict the effects that weightlessness would have on a person when they are in a similar state for longer periods of time, New Statesman illustrated in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or causes of death of the geckos will be determined.
According to Interfax, passengers who were called "sex geckos" froze.
The surprise is also shown by the fact that fruit flies that travelled on the same Foton-M4 survived the trip with difficulty, and also had offspring.
France arrests terror suspect at Nice airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being the recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
French authorities announced on Sunday.
Authorities were able to track him down after he lured a 16-year-old girl into Syria with money.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl's explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
Authorities contacted the girl's father, who was completely unaware of the daughter's intentions, and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
The man, according to authorities, is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
French intelligence officials had followed the man's actions earlier.
In France, authorities have been concerned that radicalising young people attracted to the wars in Iraq or Syria pose a security risk to France as well.
Authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or registered in France have travelled to, returned from, or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
We have a good chance of winning.
The basketball team's hopes for a further position are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine in their second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening defeat for the United States had been expected, Ukraine is again among the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the post.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine beat the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match of the Games.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under whose command Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion from three years ago.
Against the Dominican Republic, Jeter scored 16 points.
Pooh Jeter fast guy, but we've played against them before and we need to get our standard defense in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in their defeat to the United States yesterday.
We need to rediscover our strengths.
I can guarantee that a normal pack of wolves will be seen on the field, Möttölä said.
Alleged nude photos of Hollywood stars spread online - some confirmed as genuine
A number of nude images allegedly depicting well-known public figures are circulating on the Internet.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, has been the victim of a "naked image campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has released an angry comment from Lawrence's representatives, which appears to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a blatant invasion of privacy.
Authorities have been contacted, and anyone posting (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be prosecuted, officials threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the photos of her are genuine.
She had taken those pictures years ago with her husband.
Knowing that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a gruesome effort was put into this.
I sympathise with everyone who was a victim of hacking," he writes according to the site.
Instead, actress Victoria Justice calls the images that go by her own name fake.
There are also real or fake nudes of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
Honka goalkeeper criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
Football club FC Honka is currently in last place in the Veikkausliiga.
Goalkeeper Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match describe the club's confused current situation.
I haven't had a goalkeeper coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the 1-2 defeat.
Honka made a lot of defensive head mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
The goalkeeper Viitala was not pleased with the poor defensive play.
Player traffic has been busy in Honga this summer, and for that reason the defenders in front of Viitala have also changed at a rapid pace.
With player roulette, many young players have also been given opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here someday," Viitala snorted without naming any individual players.
Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed with Viitala to some extent.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you're a betting league player and you don't have to work, then you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of the opportunity, it's not my fault.
However, Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot expect immediate success when their playing mates are constantly changing.
This season has not had the same line-up twice in a row.
Especially at the defensive end, the crowd has changed.
That's the main reason we're in this position," Kuqi said.
Honka is a series jumbo after the VPS loss, tied with the second-last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veikkausliiga, so the Espoons still have time to avoid falling to the One.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not going to drop one now.
We're definitely not going to drop out of this series," goalkeeper Viitala said.
Lars von Trier doing a TV series after decades of hiatus
Film director Lars von Trier is set to return as the creator of the TV series.
The Danish director is preparing a TV series called The House That Jack Built.
The series was announced by Louise Vesth, Trier's film producer, at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.
According to a press release from the production company Zentropa, filming for the series should begin in 2016.

"Hold your breath," Aalbæk Jensen says in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his controversial media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
He directed the Kingdom series for television in the 1990s.

Ice Bucket Challenge participant dislocated jaw
Isabelle Roberts, a British woman, roared so loudly that ice-cold water was poured on her that she damaged the bones of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to treatment while completing her runaway Ice Bucket challenge so hard that her jawbone dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts roared so loudly that ice-cold water was poured over her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just roared, but as I roared, I felt my jaw start to stiffen," he told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old Briton, who took part in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday, was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.

Perspective on wolf howling (kin): How can you explain the increase in fan count?
It was a great feeling today.
This is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the European Championship final against France at the Marouss Ball Hall in Athens.
Not that Pehkonen was exaggerating.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were the 100 or so Finns who shouted into the 20,000-seat, otherwise empty hall noise.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years later after the World Cup match between Finland and Ukraine?
In Bilbao, there are 80 times the number of Finnish fans.
The 1995 European Championships was a search period for Finnish basketball.
The men made their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian qualification match at the Helsinki Sports House.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölä to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though everything did not go according to the script.
After Athens, the national basketball team dived deep.
At the Athens Games, a total of slightly over 100 Finns were reportedly present.
It included journalists, relatives of players, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can say the exact number of Finnish race tourists.
Estimates have ranged from 7,500 to 10,000.
Whatever number is in between is an incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies move across borders.
In sports, there is still a chance to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can visit to see how our girls and boys are doing in the world," says Hannu Itkonen, professor of sports sociology.
Certainly both in Spain and at the World Volleyball Championships in Poland there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
Shared experience.
It still doesn't explain everything.
The sport itself must also have appeal.
Itkonen makes sports a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold for going to sports competitions than there is for Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball federation and even players to throw themselves into top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the national team action was lifted to the pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of labor.
As Itkonen says, both sports have managed to productize their top sports, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public will also be interested.
And the media has taught us what this kind of carnival support is, Itkonen points out.
Are ball sports able to transfer this massive interest to home leagues as well?
Basketball and volleyball are played to an average of hundreds or just over a thousand spectators.
Itkonen thinks the question is good, and does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
The second school believes interest will shift.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet belly full.
This group is ready for an experiential trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic leagues are not twofold interested.
It's a challenge for the company people in the midst of the drug.
Bottas plot secured - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake shore
Nastola rewards formula driver Valtteri Bottas with a beach house plot.
The municipal government unanimously approved the disposal of a 1.4-hectare plot at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, a holiday home will be built on the property.
Nastola has been following Bottas' success since his karting days.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Lake Kärkjärvi.
It has come into the possession of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
There are seven buildings in demolition condition in the area, of which the municipality will demolish six by the end of this year.
Bottas won his fourth podium this year at the Belgian Grand Prix of Formula 1.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and lived his childhood in Villähde.
He currently lives in England but goes to Nastola whenever he is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It presents and tests them in the U.S. Open tennis competition currently taking place in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by the ball players on the field, but Marcus Giron, one of the top amateurs in college, also wears one.
According to him, the shirt helps him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nylon shirt is woven with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the mokkula on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
The central unit mokkula is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given an exact time for the sale of the shirt to begin and also did not even hint at its price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in smart clothes.
Californian Athos has brought in a smart shirt and smart shorts for sale.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
Clothes cost $100 apiece and the thumb-sized central unit they require costs $200.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technopaths.
Smart Ways to Save on Textbooks
The cost of college books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who is soon entering his second year of college, came up with a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students in later years borrow their books for a nominal fee instead of selling them right away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 to use it for the whole semester, plus a solid sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who is studying at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder reports that his books for the past semester would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University Board of Trustees, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many means at their disposal to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online stores and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students are renting textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and paying significantly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Statistics in the field reveal that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores this past spring were rental books, says Trevor Meyer, president of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are sourced from campus bookstores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Online shops
In online stores, a new book can be obtained for only a third of the price it would cost in a bookstore on campus.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but Chegg.com, the online store for specialty books, will get the book for $239.99.
Buy Used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other people's notes and worn appearance.
For example, a "Calculus" book can be bought secondhand at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University senior Matt Casaday, 25, says he bought the book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" from Amazon.com for just $0.42.
The new book would have cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls and other academics, recommends that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
At times, the reforms of the new edition are not relevant to teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found for a fraction of the price that should be paid for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
It is worth considering renting textbooks, if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for an entire semester costs about $20.
Learn about the rules of the hiring company, such as notes, the use of highlighter, and the fees that result from wear and tear.
Renter, beware: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of plain paper may also be an issue.
Sometimes these books are rented, paying for access to the e-book to its holder, for example Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store provides the "Calculus" book as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literary students save the most because several classics can now be downloaded for free, while books in the field of science and engineering can be very expensive.
Comparing different vendors pays off, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be starting soon at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, as it can be used to make sure you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is definitely in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The delivery of the book he bought was frozen for four weeks, and he eventually had to get the book at full price at the university bookstore.
Tampere-based Legion Theatre turns 20 years old
Founded in 1994, the theatre is opposed to unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
Anyone who wants to make performing art is welcome to participate.
Organizes expressive leisure activities for the long-term unemployed aged 17-35.
The performances often take a stand on society.
In recent years, there have been e.g. depression-themed Depression Moderata, Me Me! - humorous stories about narcissism and classic adaptations.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
Almost twice as many people have died in fires this year as last year.
According to media monitoring by the Finnish National Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have died in the fires so far in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over the age of 65.
According to the organization's fire death statistics, the last time the situation was worse was in 2009, when by the end of August, 64 people had died in fires.
The majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in single-family houses, and seven in terraced and other single-family houses.
Spek reminds us of the review of home fire safety.
At least all home fire alarms should be guaranteed to work, according to Speck.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire extinguishing equipment is easy to deploy.
There must also be an unobstructed escape route for all the spaces in the home.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events over the weekend and spoke with protesters who had even arrived from Belgium.
Youth rescued by air from Australia's Blue Mountains
TWO teenage hikers were lifted to safety after being stranded overnight in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking after noon on Sunday at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Relatives worried about the young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8 p.m.
A search party consisting of local police and helpers was dispatched to search for the young, and the two were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee, and the man had fallen and hit his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were brought to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian forces have withdrawn from Luhansk Airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were given orders to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have clashed fiercely with Russian tanks on the ground.
According to a military spokesman, the gunfire on the opposing side has been so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
A Ukrainian patrol vessel that received artillery hits yesterday in the Azov Sea off southeastern Ukraine sank in the morning, border patrols say.
Eight marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
Border Patrol was not sure where the ship was fired from.
The separatists said on social media yesterday that they had shot down the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov insisted, however, that Ukrainian forces must immediately withdraw to positions from which they cannot fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should bring about an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, the social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners," Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused flooding in Malmö and Copenhagen
Streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen as heavy rains whipped southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floodwaters cut off several roads, mixed traffic, and buried cars under them.
Authorities on Sunday estimated that it may take some time for the flooding to subside, although rains were predicted to stop by Monday.
The heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise, and no weather warning was given for the rains in advance.
Ari Mustala, a meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front that affected the area was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "be quiet and help France," Francois Hollande's chief supporter says.
Valls urged the deeply divided left to "show its feelings" for a socialist president with difficulties, whose new government composition did not gain the approval of the French majority.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by his side," Valls said and earned a round of applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave the controversial 35-hour working week in France alone, despite a controversial suggestion by new finance minister Emmanuel Macron earlier this week that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday Hollande asked the socialists to act in concert with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused controversy by appearing at a meeting of socialist MPs who expressed dissent and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, mocked the socialists' continued dissension and said he did not believe the new Valls government would last more than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war by phone, but so did Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the former did not last even a summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
He reiterated his party's proposal to dissolve parliament and considered certain of his party's election victory in the early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The French ruling party suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the far right held the top spot in the May EU elections.
According to a poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several competing groups before the end of Hollande's term in 2017.
Po University political scientist Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that change is happening," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
Pokka betrayed Morning The Finnish hosts Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda badly failed in the recorded portion of the programme.
Last Thursday, the Good Morning Finland program posted a funny video of Thursday's recordings on its Facebook page.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Siirta and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record a Morning Finland commercial puff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording doesn't go quite straight.
Alm-Shift is going crazy in his words as he tries to pronounce the word budget, and his craziness also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their heads time and time again.
And these heroes should still be allowed to broadcast live tomorrow, according to the Facebook update of Good Morning Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the magazine photo agency, finished third in the series of portraits in 1972.
The picture shows Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held on Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with her.
However, at the beginning of the meeting, we got more than five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture from four to five meters away.
The light and background were in place.
I immediately realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir's face shows that leaders in the Middle East have had a difficult time in the past.
At that time, the competition was dominated by images of well-known people or events.
It's great that nowadays you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I have taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's downfall from the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Dissertation: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than five million euros
Investigating the legality of the operations of the Helsinki Police Narcotics Unit has already cost over five million euros and required 30-50 person-years of work.
This is the assessment of Jyri Rajamäki in her doctoral dissertation in information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki proposes that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the prevention of crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the information technology systems of investigation and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He states that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to solve the crime is automatically electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and at the same time enables comprehensive legality control.
The dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes belong to the vegetarian diet"
A picture of a special bulletin on the wall of a Pirkkala Women's Journey school caused a food scare on social media, says Yle on his website.
Vegetarians!
The vegetarian diet at the school lunch includes fish and chicken dishes.
Only when meat is on the list do we make a vegetarian option!
This is stated in a 15-year-old bulletin forgotten on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Purity Services, says to Yle that the note forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there was once an idea like this, which was discussed with health care in its time.
Every student gets a meal according to their wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, students at Pirkkala schools are offered a vegetarian option only with parental permission and a certificate from a doctor or public health nurse about a vegetarian diet.
Vaarma justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that the young people's vegetarian food experiments may leave the nutrition insufficient and the lack of meat or chicken may raise surprises from the students' parents.
Norwegian Cruise close to $3 billion Prestige Cruise deal
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to acquire its rival Prestige Cruises International Inc. for $3 billion, data from people closely involved.
With the acquisition, Norwegian Cruise, with a market capitalization of $6.8 billion, would gain access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruisers and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to sources, information about a possible agreement may be published as early as this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names in the public domain because there are no negotiations going on in the public domain.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment and Apollo declined to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with route maps covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its net sales increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, when its net sales were $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which also operates from Miami, sails under the Oceania and Regent brand names, which include a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the rise of emerging economies such as the middle classes in China and India.
Companies compete to become the number one choice for these new customers as they choose to cruise.
Prestige Cruises registered its first share issue on the US stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, which was valued at $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 with its current line-up after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to published information, Genting's share of the company was 28 percent, Apollo's 20 percent and private equity firm TPG Capital LP's share was 8 percent from the end of June onwards.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American cruise capacity, according to a registration document released by Prestige Cruise when the shares were issued.
The Tampere City Board will discuss the matter today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will give strong support to the initiative.
According to Animalia's Executive Director, Salla Tuomivaara, who is preparing her doctoral dissertation for the University of Tampere, the period of dolphinariums in Finland and around the world should end quickly.
Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a growing perception around the world that the feeding of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphinariums is neither animal welfare nor ethically sustainable.
This view would also like to be carried to Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an animal rights issue, but also a question of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
According to Tuomivaara, the death of the Näsi dolphin reinforces the demands for the closure of the dolphinarium operations.
Näsi's death is a sad continuation of the dark history of the Särkänniemi dolphinarium.
It is time to put an end to the deaths, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how Tampere dolphins could be moved to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Näsi did not have time to experience a return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have time to experience more than just an uninspired concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Welfare Association of Finland Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the comprehensive reform of the Animal Welfare Act currently under preparation.
This includes dolphinariums.
To support the demand, Animalia's Executive Director Tuomivaara will participate in a demonstration on behalf of the dolphins to be held today, September 1.
The demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki takes a stand against the dolphin hunting season that is starting in Japan.
During the hunting season, about 2,300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for use in dolphinariums or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open talks on new state with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the departing region, Russian news sources report.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of Eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend its own rights and interests.
Putin's call on the Kiev government to negotiate with pro-Russian rebels as equals is in line with his apparent strategy since the beginning of the violence five years ago: to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian government to practically grant Novorossiya, which has recently been declared, independence, allowing it to head to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with state TV channel Channel 1, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military's efforts to retake the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, whose separatists took over in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently christened the region "Novorossija", "New Russia" - this term is reminiscent of the days of glory preceding the revolutions of the Russian Great Power.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said that the planned peace talks will be an "illusion" as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the October 26 parliamentary elections and government forces attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must immediately start extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state in south-eastern Ukraine, thus taking into account the interests of the people who live there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "statehood" is related to a broader independence that has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership in an attempt to dispel fears of Russian-speaking regions being threatened by their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a conflict within Ukraine".
The Kremlin spokesman's interjection, which aimed to correct Putin's "misinterpretation" of his comments, stressed that the Russian government treats the separatist uprising in the eastern regions differently than it did in Crimea, when it virtually took over an area with a population of 2 million people that is ethnically Russian.
It would be much more difficult for Moscow to annex even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and because pre-conflict opinion polls indicate that the majority of the population was in favour of remaining in Ukraine.
Independence, discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums, would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree their own trade agreements and foreign relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually control over the region that connects Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia five months ago, is home to Russia's main fleet, as well as commercial shipping port areas and historic coastal sites.
In the area between Rostov and Crimea in Russia, there are also mines, factories and metal smelters that produce products vital to the Russian army.
In his inaugural speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers — after new elections — consider constitutional changes to increase the decision-making power of regions that are different from the Ukrainian core region in terms of their own economy and language status.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the separatists, perhaps armed and instigated by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Putin made his latest call to the Kiev government for talks with pro-Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced further last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
Ukrainian security officials fear that the seizure of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky is the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal region as far as Crimea.
Mariupol, with a population of half a million, is known as a steel-producing port city, located between Novoazovsky and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, pleading for further action to prevent further violations by Russia in Ukraine, a former republic of the Soviet Union that has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach the point of no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders suggested that additional sanctions be drawn up so that they can be imposed if the Ukraine crisis flares up again in unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian armored units and 1,000 soldiers moved to Donetsk region last week to strengthen troubled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged for 10 Russian parachutists who were captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was scored by Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of play.
In the second half, Sulley Muntari and a little later Jeremy Menez hit the penalty kick.
Lazio also received a penalty at the end of the game, but goalkeeper Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan this season from Real Madrid.
In Milan's former offensive icon Inzagh's coaching debut, San Siro Stadium was only half over.
The audience for the match was reported to be 39,000 spectators.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the whirlwind of the nude photo scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he is outraged after hackers may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Grecko.
There has been a buzz in the entertainment world since a number of Jennifer Lawrence nude photos were posted on the internet as a result of an extensive celebrity photo hacking scandal.
The hacker is said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, including supermodel Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Photos of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko living in Melbourne have also been reportedly stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal contact and photos should remain private.
It is a disgrace that private information can be stolen and spread.
Grecko, who is in New York City, is reported to have commented on the incident in an online newspaper as "disgraceful" and said that the victims "feel shamed."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of Palmer topless on the edge of the pool.
Palmer's film merits include the film "Love and Honor" with co-star Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ that "this is an insolent invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen angered the hacker in a tweet: "Publishing photos stolen from a cell phone is no different from selling a stolen product."
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, from a legal point of view alone.
Finland played almost as if at home and came to a sensational victory over Cuba in the Volleyball World Cup.
Take a look at the photos of the fan drug.
Poland's Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white but Finnish blue and white.
The Finnish victory was followed by nearly 2,000 Finnish supporters at the Spodek Arena, according to STT.
It felt like playing at home.
That's how big an impact the fans had on our game," Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland had already lost 0-2 in the match, but went 3-2 in the win.
In the fourth round, Finland made a miracle climb behind six points.
