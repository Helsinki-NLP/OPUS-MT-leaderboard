Members of the Welsh Assembly are afraid of looking like fools
Some members of the Representative Council are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP, that is, Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The controversy began with a plan to change the name of the Representative Council to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Representative Council, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change may make them a target for ridicule.
According to one Labour spokesman, the group is concerned that the name "strips with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to a Plaid party spokesman, the majority of the group is "not satisfied" and has suggested other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group is "open-minded" about the name change, but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the MWP word to the word for fool.
In Welsh, the letter "w" is pronounced in this context similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Representative Council Commission, which is currently drafting the legislative amendment needed for the name change, said: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Representative Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the nomination of a representative body as the Parliament of Wales enjoys broad support.
The Commission preferred the title of Representative Council Members to the Welsh Parliament or the abbreviation WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Representative Council apparently propose alternative titles, but the lack of consensus may cause a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to propose amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on changes includes other changes to the functioning of the Representative Council, such as rules on the loss of office and the form of the committee system.
In the legislative reading, the members of the Representative Council can cast their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to polls in referendum on changing country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of its northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership aspirations.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply a price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins clocks go down as Harlem churches live through difficult times
"The elderly people I've talked to say there used to be a bar or a church on every street corner," says Adams.
"There's neither these days."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said, "People's interactions have changed."
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's common living rooms where people gather on a regular basis."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not go as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they will be back to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced with residences and apartments that are not occupied by people who support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"Absolutely, most people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will hasten the day when these churches close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people moving into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and the St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's central commercial street, over their opposition to the hiring or promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they adopted the tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "the bell of the poor."
An expert who played the tower clock game in July called it something else: a "cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that it was the world's first tower clock game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex skein, which is partly connected with architects and contractors hired by the laity leaders of the Church and the Episcopal Diocese.
Sakasti, an administrative body composed of lay leaders of the congregation, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to roll the costs" on the sakasti, even though the sakasti had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he was diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was just excited to catch the lobster, but then realized he was screaming, "I got bit!"
I was bitten!'
Upon reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
"I screamed everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of shark that attacked is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim sustained serious injuries to his torso.
Authorities closed the beaches at Casablad from Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments where expert advisors serve.
This is a major move for the UK's £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite declining fashion and home goods sales. Larger beauty departments are being trialled in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets sought to fill shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury's says its range of beauty products will double to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique range, and in the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop chain is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the switch to small one-time purchases in convenience stores force supermarkets to invent new lures for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
Since purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and Habitat stores in addition, which the company says has promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to reform its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute over how the profits from pharmacies in supermarkets should be shared.
The new strategy follows an acquisition in which Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxury skincare products to four stores with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us a compelling beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "furious" when TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home accessories and accessories brand, Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" at last Tuesday's tense meeting at Jones' business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million deal would not leave enough time for their home supply and accessories label, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to secure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone in astonishment.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold".
This Morning host is one of Britain's most confident stars, and his departure could result in millions in losses for the company, according to experts, due to product investments that include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to homeware, not to mention delays in publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as chairman in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is baked by M&S's new brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "we won't comment on his business."
Tough talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comment, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, and his positivity towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be the voice of the "news anchor."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had heralded the first meeting in July as a significant step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, nuclear arms talks have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said, the United States would continue its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom, and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more into this crowded hall outside, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of him.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroyed island, hundreds dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international assistance was not declared, although about 10 percent of Lombok residents had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children forms a group travelling to Return, it is not certain whether the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains woefully unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the frequent earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The return likely lost lives due to the lack of tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in effect.
Travelling between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship ordered to help the victims of the Lombok earthquake is on its way to Return, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's development of worn-out infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has poured money into improving roads and railways.
However, either administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while new elections are approaching next year.
Tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion, also add to the pressure.
Christian and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sinks late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 away from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before scooping a shot towards the back post.
The shot hovered high over the penalty area towards the upper right corner.
Finally, the ball dropped over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing up as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much".
Chelsea led the game 1-0 at halftime after Belgium's Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave the bear access to Mateo Kovacic in the situation, before spinning away near midfield and sprinting to Liverpool's field half.
Kovacic played a quick wall pass in midfield.
He then released Hazard to the penalty area with a spectacular pass-through.
Hazard escaped from the defence and passed Liverpool with a shot from Alisson Becker's left foot in the back corner.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's Disaster Agency reported early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Office spokesman Sutopo Purwo told a press conference that many had been trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves as high as six metres.
Fragments of collapsed buildings spread widely to the town of Palu, with 380,000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
The body of a woman found at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning triggered a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. by Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video to contact the police, who may have information vital to the investigation".
A female police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may have known the woman have come to the scene of the crime and asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim's loved ones of what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it could be hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was overheard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon there were two maids in the isolated area, and an additional third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who monitored the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously call Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using code 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue also became part of history's rewriting controversy
To evict the statue would be poetic justice, considering that his own fanatic Puritan supporters destroyed England's cultural and religious memorabilia like the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate over removing the statues would make a target of the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of Westminster Palace.
Cromwell neither commanded nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The false Cromwell might suffer for the actions of his forefather, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell embodies 19th-century opinions and is historical evidence of a figure still considered worthy of praise by many.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, see Cromwell as a defender of parliament against the external pressure that was, of course, brought about by the monarchy in this case.
Whether or not this is an accurate description of the subject is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the mid-17th century controversy has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that divide.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance."
Killer pig crushes Chinese farmer to death
Local media reports that a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his last name "Yuan" was found near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province. The man's artery was broken and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pigherd prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door to a nearby pig farm open.
In the piglet, he said he saw a big boar with a mouth full of blood.
According to the news, forensics confirmed the death of a 250-pound boar-grossing farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The CCTV footage shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up so as not to harm others as police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans in the past, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-pound pig wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
An Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are generally not aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt.
They just need to be properly respected," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's Remnants Bring Widespread Rainfall to the U.S. Southwest
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico's north coast.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa had a wind speed of 38 meters per second, or a first-class hurricane, at 5 a.m. on Sunday, east coast time, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa enters the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical moisture that then interacts with the approaching low pressure will form large areas of precipitation to the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 25-100 millimetres of rainfall cause dangerous torrential flooding and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rainfall of 50-75 millimetres per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the southwest, and Arizona in particular, are expected to receive as much as 50 to 100 millimeters of rain.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the event of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid leaving the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms produce local wind gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure zone will bring local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of more than 10 mm is possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the area.
Scattered tropical rains begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations in temperatures can be seen throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
In the middle of the United States, an excellent example of large temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, as well as Nebraska, St. Louis, and Iowa's Des Moines.
The lingering heat of summer will tend to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
The beginning of October is widely expected to be warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures near +26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature can climb to +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
According to our long-term forecast, the eastern United States has a good chance of above-average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million watched a broadcast on Tuesday by six television channels, in which Supreme Court Justice-designate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies suspended their broadcasts at the last minute turn, according to which the FBI is conducting a week-long investigation into the allegations based on an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, who was intoxicated, groped him and tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony saying that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC., CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures from other channels that broadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has trouble measuring viewers who watch in offices.
Something about the proportions tells us that the figure corresponds to the number of spectators of an American football playoff match or an Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel had the highest number of viewers of any television network, with opinion leaders strongly supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
At the center of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed him being escorted to an elevator by protesters on his way to a hearing in the Justice Committee on Friday.
CNN showed him straight up as he stood for minutes with his eyes down as the bleatings flew.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told.
Flake said his office issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks broadcast directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting to take Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have called for.
Flake was partially convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit politicking
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses those criticising her plans to leave the EU of politics that threaten Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnsonin calls the proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's import duties "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who played basketball at LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department, charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a showdown between Sims and Simpson in which police say Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during questioning.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate magazine.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "industriousness and justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning he was "terrified" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid something like this will happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ashes over Mexico City
Ash erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico's Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash discharges were registered in 24 hours.
The centre recorded thunder and vibrations several times.
Images were posted on social media in which cars' windscreens were covered with a thin layer of ash in residential areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southwest of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook Mexico in September 2017.
Known as "Don Goyo", the volcano has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash before independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police, with thousands taking part in rival demonstrations on the first anniversary of the dissenting vote.
Police detained a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark clouds of dust on the normally tourist-filled streets.
During the day, more skirmishes erupted as police officers used their batons to contain the melee.
The clashes between the pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former chanting "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter chanting "Long live Spain".
The local press reports that fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations.
Tension remains high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but is being celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low as those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
Catalan officials say nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when police tried to block voting at polling stations across the region.
On Friday, pro-independence groups stayed outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful of Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we're stuck," he says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory in last December's regional elections, the momentum of the pro-independence parties in Catalonia has dwindled this year, with many of the most well-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides have fueled the controversy.
"The situation is getting tighter all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders in remand since the last nine years, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion and repression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car reportedly crashed repeatedly into a house in Londonderry.
The events unfolded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
A crossbow might have been fired at the car at some point.
Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0 with a Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal at Livingston secured victory
Livingston stunned the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard to lose another 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was finally enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the first away win of the season in the Premiership, and will next face Series Director Hearts on Sunday, eight points ahead.
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his undefeated streak in the series for six games. Head coach Holt has not lost once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost seats against a blade-deprived visitor
Holt's team should have led long before their goal after causing the Rangers serious trouble with their straightness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide. Next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide in front of goal to Craig Halkett's butt pass, but passed the ball.
The hosts favored giving control of the ball to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate for special situations.
This is how the important goal came about.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a spot for Menga, allowing him to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found the home team's defense to be holding, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly could hardly be tried.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow steered the ball past yet another Livingston special situation.
The centralizations that rained on Livingston's penalty area were constantly cleaned up, and two situations called for a penalty kick - Halkett's tackle of replacement Glenn Middleton and the ball that hit his hand.
"Awesome performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent up to each player, continuing through the upswings.
The team's method of play and crew has not changed much since its return to the highest level.However, Holt must be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the match.
But the Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has occasionally performed really well under Gerrard, but now fell far short of his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, the middle caste of the league table.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, the purpose of which is to repair relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the matter for security reasons, but a large number of supporters still gathered nearby to watch the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the fore, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him into the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect a split in opinion, with some Turks in Germany hailing him as a hero while others slander him as a despot.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died when he crashed into a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:00 a.m. local time in the southwest corner of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and medical personnel came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's crash site.
City police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been diverted. Motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report that six prison guards were injured in the high security clearance of men in the prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday British time and continues.
Tornado special police officers have been brought in to calm the unrest, with eight prisoners behind them in one prison wing.
Minor injuries to the police were treated at the scene.
A prison administration spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been sent to HMP Long Lartin to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have received treatment for their injuries.
We do not condone violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In addition, riot police were alerted to the prison in October due to serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain flooding to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical low pressure rarely arrives in Arizona, but that's exactly what's going to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's remains move across the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of torrential rains over Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to proceed directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
In a tweet, the Phoenix National Weather Service noted that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure state within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 65 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest modeling from the National Hurricane Center predicts rains of 50 to 100 millimeters, with up to 150 millimeters of rain on the Mogoll Ridge in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rocky mountains and Great Basin, it is likely that 25-50 millilitres will be obtained. In some places, it can rain up to 100 millimetres in total.
Rosa rains can also be a blessing in an area affected by drought if there is no risk of torrential flooding.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some rainfall may be beneficial because of severe droughts in the south-southwest.
According to the U.S. Department of Droughts, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. At that time, it is still hurricane strong with wind speeds of 135 kilometers per hour. It is moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its strength as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico in the strength of a tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"From the California peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 75-150 millimeters is expected, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey across Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low-pressure Tuesday morning hours. From there, it continues its journey across Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday evening..
"The greatest risks of rosa or its remains are probably associated with extremely heavy rainfall in the California peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. southwest desert," the National Hurricane Agency said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential flooding and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in a "stable" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
Police are requesting contact from anyone who may have video footage of the events recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh experienced the Democratic Party's "wickedness and anger"
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's "wickedness and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the charge of sexual harassment filed by Christine Blasey Ford, which would have occurred decades ago in their teen years.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said "Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character, and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time, with excellent credentials in public service," he told his West Virginia crowd.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the full," he said.
"That's why I go round and round to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats took it upon themselves to "resist and block."
A senior assistant to the Republican Party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination procedure is expected in the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Officials reported at least 384 dead on Saturday after a major earthquake and tsunami struck Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, many of whom were wiped out by giant waves hitting the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as six metres hit the shore at dusk. Many were washed to their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately flee, leaving them as victims," said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Mitigation (BNPB) in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it pulled cars, tree trunks, houses and hit everywhere on land," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached a speed of 800 kilometers per hour on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the Disaster Bureau show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a water-encircled mosque.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have inflated the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found in the rubble of the collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and that the damage may be greater from Palus 300 kilometers north to the continuous coast, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the quake.
Communications "are completely cut off, and no information has been received from Donggala," Nugroho says.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building shouts frantic warnings of an impending tsunami to people on the street.
Minutes later, a wall of water strikes the beach, taking away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say the army has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport aircraft, but those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief purposes only, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision's Donggala staff have reached safety in the city of Palu, where they are housed in tent-clothed canopies in the office's courtyard.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As relief groups began their turbulent mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Return.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin to flow once the affected area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the second night came down on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing people entertained the hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's hang glider national team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, says Mandagi.
"As a senior member of the addiction team, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he was desperately trying to reach Palu's competitors at the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the hang gliding community.
However, after the messages he sent, only one grey mark appeared instead of two blue ones.
"I understand that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 in connection with ATM replenishment at Newport on the Wide
On Friday morning, thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security worker while he was completing an ATM at Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car had been emptying and replenishing an ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While the Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "a man ran after him" who stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Eyewitnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but police did not specify their number.
Individuals with information about their identities are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "a character formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a nickname for 41-year-old West for some time, and she also used it as the title for her eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album called Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, canceled her participation for "emotional reasons."
West has previously said that the word also has religious significance for him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
Discussing the name of the album earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is 'you'.
"So I'm you, we, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in the shorter form of Ye - which only embodies the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is essentially a reflection on who we are."
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs is known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Also, West's previous collaborator Jay-Z has occasionally removed and restored the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use army against civilians
President-elect of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, promised that he would never use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who performed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that he would "never use an army to oppress the Mexican people."
Armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student financial aid and opening more free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities is driving young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for AI Research
The U.S. should double the funding it uses to research AI as China boosts its efficiency in the industry, says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by announcements about AI in various parts of the U.S. administration, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan as early as last year: it aims to become the leading AI developer by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
A doubling of funding could double the likelihood of the next major AI achievement in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house. He works as CEO at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's major AI companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which beat the highest ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he held leadership positions at Microsoft Research as well as head of Google's operations in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. investigators worked hard to get a public grant.
"Academic influences are not taken by China, but by big corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think AI PhD graduates should automatically be awarded green cards," he said.
China's State Council on its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academia partners, and the White House has announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment this month in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, in turn, invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing country's name
In a referendum on Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a name change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country's aspirations for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, considers the name of the North Neighbours to be in effect a territorial requirement for its territory, and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the required 50% for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can seek membership in both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote so that it will have a decisive effect.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent in the previous 2016 general election, when 66 per cent of eligible voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonia's name change in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018. The name change would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of tents erected by boycotters in front of the Skopje parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, like China and Russia as part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will vote for the name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" vote was "responsible for our future."
An opinion poll published Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute pointed to a turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - that is, below the required level of activity.
In another poll commissioned by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat all of Brighton's defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the goal he scored at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player received a pass from the midfielder.
He found empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English point used its first touch inside the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who overtook Brighton guard Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot aimed at the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his feet".
"We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored in that time."
However, Sterling had already given the Sky Blues an advantage in the Premier League struggle.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass through to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane made a few touches before sending the ball to the back post towards Sterling.
The attacker of the sky blues poked the ball into the net just before the end line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a buzzkill in the game against the Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why force yourself into the starting lineup?
However, Scherzer, who is as competitive as ever, hopes to take over the pitching mound in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a playoff seam.
The Rockies took at least a wild card with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
"Even if we don't have a bet, at least we can get up to the pitching mound, knowing that the atmosphere of an audience and another team's dent here in Denver will create for me the most demanding competitive setup I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take up the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet released their starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer a chance under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training period on Thursday, he would play his 34 games in the start and pitch on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistic is 2.53 and he has burned the batter to the nest 300 times, with an innings statistic of 220 2/3.
Trump campaign in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who at the same time spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"All of our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning to the fullest, and that's why I go around everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't complain about who they're hurting or who needs to be bulldozed in order to come to power. That's what they want, power and power, but we're not giving it to them".
He said the Democrats took it upon themselves to "resist and block."
"And it's been visible in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and malevolent and false."
When he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the public responded with loud boos.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, no, I'm waiting a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen".
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinion
I was not really surprised when the Momentum activists of my local party supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the latest Labour representative in the queue, who is told I'm not welcome - just because we say what we think.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way only because of her firm opposition to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have served as the local Labour representative, the Friday-sizes of the party council have been just that.
Now not many meetings follow that tone, and a "kinder and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Labour will no longer tolerate dissent and that every opinion will be judged on whether or not it is suitable for party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues with whom I had thought I shared a similar political view began to expect a turnaround from me and statements that I would otherwise never have agreed to, be it in terms of national security or the EU's internal market.
Whenever I speak out in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a surge of insults on social media calling for my election to be canceled, for centrist politics to be rejected, and I get to hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because at least the comments made to me are political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist abuse on a daily basis and never waver.
The normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features of the politics of this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn called for Labour to embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting differing opinions, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the election rules, the party only becomes more limited.
For two years, I've been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts in order to make "everything go well".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining Labour as a student 32 years ago as a result of the Thatcher Government's neglect of the Unified School, I, as a city councillor as well as a minister, have sought to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never concealed my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency has been able to be surprised by my views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a manner that I think is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for the Nottingham East constituency
Ayr - Melrose 38-17: The undefeated Ayr at the blockhead
The two last-minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned the win in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that has not lost a game.
A great defense and more successful risk-taking was what supported them after all, and Coach Peter Murchie may well be pleased.
"We've been challenged in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I can be pleased," he says.
Melrose's Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card from Scotland captain Roy Hughes, who was handed over by the Warriors to the game, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and managed a conversion kick, increasing Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second period well with Patrick Anderson's goal, in whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with a goal by Stafford McDowall, in whose conversion kick Climo succeeded.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Bruce Colvine of Melrose scored a goal whose conversion kick failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored from the back of Ayr's maul, who left the sideline throw.
Climo managed the conversion kick the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and spurred Gregor Henry to finish the home team's fifth goal.
Still Game series star starts in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named the head of a licensed restaurant company and is likely to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he co-wrote with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is listed as the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the information, but a source for the Scottish Sun newspaper hinted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, a landlocked country, is trying to reconnect with the Pacific Ocean through legal channels
Sailors patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
In the flagpoles of public buildings, a sea blue flag flies.
The naval bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been smeared with the slogan: "Legally, the sea belongs to us.
Getting it back is our duty."
In inland Bolivia, the memory of the lost shoreline in Chile's bloody 19th-century resource war remains strong — as does the longing to sail the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia waits for the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, team spirit and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in anticipation of a final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are hopeful to follow the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens, hoping that the position of Bolivia on Chile's obligation to grant independent access to the sea will be upheld in The Hague — after decades of interminable debate.
Bolivia's charismatic president Evo Morales, facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, has a lot at stake in next Monday's alignment.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's best interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution of Dutch origin does not have the authority to hand over the administrative regions of Chile, and the ICJ has also stated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is issued just six months after the last statements suggest that the case "is not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed rather than served Bolivia's purposes.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity," said Zárate.
Morales' argument-challenging rhetoric has stifled the rest of Chileans' benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations afterwards.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday gives Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to connect with the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Will Not Happen Unless It Can Trust the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Ri's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the U.S. met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "far-flung dream" to believe that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to the Korean War ending declaration would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is wary of adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang was about to give up the arsenal of weapons that the state likely sees as the only real way to guarantee its own security has been met with widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of large-sized headdresses that will soon be on your nearby street as well
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of special oversized headgear at their SS19 collection show, which dazzled the fashion districts of Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather brim that covered the ends of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple —but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask resembled more of a diving gear, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're in luck.
Followers of fashion predict that huge scarves are emerging on the street.
The oversized hats follow strictly "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter brim that has been seen by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult fame of the impractical hat, which was widely seen on social media, also inspired another large creation for fashion shows — a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The burnt orange reed trim-lined raffle bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation from Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I expect to see large-sized hats and beach bags on the street next summer — the designers have made such an impression that it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for a global citizen
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test scores. The success has been enhanced by individual and communal success in sports, arts, music and other community-based projects.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), aim to provide a high level of service to their students as well as the parents of their pupils.
Private schools strive to prepare their students for careers of their choice, graduate and higher education, and global citizenship.
As an actor in the field of education who can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable subject to continue in educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his or her own language, the message goes to his or her heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships with people in other countries.
From this year's latest test results, we find that languages are at the top of the list in terms of pass rate among private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
The data were collected from 74 schools belonging to the SCIS, and it was found that among the students who received the highest grade of A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are held in the same esteem as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study program and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014 found that 17 percent of situations in which an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of young people's future career development.
The more potential work tasks require language skills, the more essential these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied a second language, he or she will have an advantage over this lifelong skill in the future, regardless of which career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner puts a person with language skills automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov, 75 percent of the more than 4,000 British adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language to have a two-digit number of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Especially the knowledge of languages in developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while others specifically teach languages that are expected to be important to British people in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child's interests, there are always several language options in private schools, taught by specialized teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment,languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Private Schools SCIS
LeBron to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for LeBron James to make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in a pre-season game in San Diego.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the drills, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia Campaign, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned election events for next week, including sympathetic destinations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the free seat of the Supreme Court Justice, Trump is seeking to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event begins at 7 p.m. on the East Coast on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as a live stream via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump is expected to comment on this week's hearing of Supreme Court Justice-designate Brett Kavanaugh, who became impassioned on charges of sexual harassment that have delayed the Senate confirmation vote by as much as a week as the FBI investigated the charges.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tough November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign was commented on in these next week's five events to "awaken volunteer and supportive Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Managing Congress is so essential to his intentions that the president is willing to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Today's venue is the Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump backs Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows fighting spirit to keep hope alive before Sunday's solo games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon doubles were just what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-affirming power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this one.
Where, according to them, is this power of success right now?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we'll take this success power as a bump," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a bit of wind in their sails and a lot to be encouraged by, like the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been the superior brick to the green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the victory celebration intensified as his round progressed as he managed a critical putt to even the match to four as he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
Putt, with whom they won the 15th game, was followed by a similar cry that gave the impression that he believes that the United States team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and only worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The peculiar but sweet duo of Europe have won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only duo that didn't make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this raucous crowd, confirms that they are Sunday's favourites. And when the sun sets in Le Golf National, there could be no other player more popular than Fleetwood and Molinari to ensure a possible victory for Europe.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the talk of Europe's success is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning's four-player game, paired with Alex Noren.
One bogie and two double bogies in the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swede so deep into the pit that they were nowhere near surviving.
On Sunday, however, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-player are fascinating to follow closely from the point of view of couples working together: What kind of advice they give or don't give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a considerable lead before the last day, but this four-player game showed that the US team has a fighting spirit, although it has been suspected, especially in the US.
Europe takes 10-6 lead ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe is in a good lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after they took a 10-6 lead from the United States in Saturday's four-balls and four-games.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the winning streak with two wins over rapping Tiger Woods, and scored a high of four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who worked hard to keep Hazeltine from losing two years ago, dominated the weak-playing U.S. team in the morning's four-ball, taking the game to 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four games, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood" together, were the second two in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball, they then finished the unsurpassed Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more forcefully 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, was at times very brilliant, but has nevertheless lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-player, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but returned with Henrik Stenson in four-ball, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time title winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four-ball after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team risen from a four-point chase position to levels at the start of doubles, although on Furyk's side a tie is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days of being the second best, it may be that Sunday's counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea 'by no means' disarms itself without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased mistrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" over the past year, such as shutting down nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the test site for nuclear tests, and promising that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the preservation of national security, so in such circumstances, disarming ourselves unilaterally is not possible."
Although Ri repeated the familiar lament that Washington does not approve of a phase-out of nuclear weapons in which North Korea would be rewarded for every interjection, his statement is nevertheless significant in that unilateral disarmament was not completely ruled out, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S.-Sitting President and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim asserted "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for 'nuclear disarmament first', and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force — even opposing the 'Declaration of Peace'," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a dream of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continued sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the disarming party were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a deadlock."
Yet Ri's tone was noticeably different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the continental United States was inevitable after "evil President" Trump called Kim a "missileman with suicidal intentions."
As recently as last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea. However, this year, Trump praised Kim profusely for his courage to approach the issue of giving up weapons, yet stressed that there is still much work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea gives up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and unfailing until we prove a full, final and confirmed abdication of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of shutting down the funding channels for Pyongyang's production of ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Pompeo met with North Korea's Rin in the margins of the UN General Assembly and also announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress that had been made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterlike demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to shutting down the missile base and nuclear facility in a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event of "similar measures" being taken by the United States.
According to Pompeo, Kim means "similar measures" to the security guarantees Trump undertook at the Singapore meeting and the move toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate rest instructional course
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are attending a course this year designed to increase students' rest. The course is a counter-attack to the thriving macho culture at the university, where students press long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of the basics of their own well-being.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard University School of Medicine, who works on sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course will be the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, in my senior year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I found surprising," he told the Telegraph in an interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how the right sleep habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard University's Faculty of Medicine and deputy director of health services at the university, says the university ended up organizing a course after they had heard how students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented with an image of a dormitory room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, and thus get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effect of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this does not have an immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe that they have a right to know about these things in exactly the same way that they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," adds Professor Czeisler.
All-night study marathons are still a matter of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting adequate and quality sleep should be the students' 'secret weapon' against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a brain-like state, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave the impetus for a course covering all students on campus.
He hopes that all graduate students could complete a similar course of study before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to remind them of bedtime as well as waking up in the morning, as well as telling them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electric displays and LED lighting "blue light" on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot took victory from Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were looking for their first win since the February 4-5 game against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard now only suffered his second loss during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' fallen will to fight no longer evened out the situation.
The Rangers dropped to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, with only Hibernian in the goal difference above.
The Rangers may have other problems ahead, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown from the gueststand hit his head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight substitutions for the team that had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 line-up that the team took the point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again paid off when the well-built line-up managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score as early as two minutes after Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide into the back post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but in the final third of the game there was no more confidence in the air.
Alfredo Morelos called for punishment when, at fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly repulsed Lassana Coulibaly's butt and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected start, but it wasn't just because of the team's hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long pass tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher pitched the ball to Scott Robinson, who cool-headedly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
In exchange, Gerrard decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change affected the game almost immediately as Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by Kelly's impressive rapid defense.
Livingston put the visitors to play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long passes one after another.
Holt's team had a chance to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his position at the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who came out of the Rangers exchange, also demanded a penalty kick after clashing with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter inventor
The next page of our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany on this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention later led to the development of a device known as a geiger counter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter also became a key concept in pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado's Watches", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play scientists who appear to be quite cowboys, is well suited:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter. It's used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you place your headphones in your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really driving!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to 'see' malignant cells
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ the malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see' the proteins typical of several cancers
The trial vaccine has given promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer lost their cancer cells for 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
In the method, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and altered in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of several cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "Based on our results, this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "guides the growth of several types of cancer," explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them how to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was attacked by critics for praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump and announcing that he would run for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song "Ghost Town" dressed in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearing is related to allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's rant was not broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock posted a snippet of it on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mistreated for wearing a hat on his behind-the-scenes.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told not to go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they'll still say I'm marginalized," West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginalized?" and says he's wearing a Superman cape because "then you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
According to Variety, West's comments sparked boos from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the magazine as follows: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West was selected on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West receives support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, who praised her courage on Twitter: "THANK YOU WHEN THE VICTIMS ARE MASSIVE".
However, Karen Hunter, who runs the talk show, tweeted that West "is just herself, which is just wonderful."
However, I can choose NOT to support a person (by buying their music or clothing brand or by supporting their "art"), which I consider to support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us," he added.
The rapper announced prior to his evening appearance on Twitter that he had changed his name to "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and subsequently to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knifeman charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The indictment will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero stereotype: according to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural supplement, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Recently, Harrington, who is also a member of the Game of Thrones star guard, also married to 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admits that he has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we've gone wrong with masculinity is raising strong feelings in me right now," he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to the problems now discernible?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters appearing on it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain kind of man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
There is something really wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the pre- or sequels to the Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer because, in his own words, he has "had enough of battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, about a film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best the Game of Thrones has offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the love interest of Harrington's Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say the virus is affecting more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, meaning a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through contaminated blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, HIV infections that have occurred in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV transmission via sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of disease are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator's information and accuses of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday allegations that her employee had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages about them.
A Democrat from Los Angeles asserted that the allegations were spread by "extremely right-wing" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the published data were the home addresses and phone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham, representing South Carolina, and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing the state of Utah.
The information was released Thursday by an unknown individual from the United States Congress during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that, according to Hillin newspaper, the messages were posted from an IP address connected to Waters' office and by a Waters staff member.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly met with criticism on the Internet, and former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer was also with the critics.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character does not suit a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to act hostile.
There is no reason to be defiant.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to behave calmly and calmly in this situation."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for Waters' seat in the congressional midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies on these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they are brought to legal responsibility for any destructive and dangerous actions against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again — Underpowered Rowan Atkinson's Agent Parody
It is already an established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that is even slightly tilted towards Britain. However, this does not seem to fit into the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series that originated in 2003 with the Johnny English webcast and resurfaced with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English - Born Again".
Can language in the cheek of a nation become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the goo-eyed, rubber-faced, and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. Even his name indicates above all that it is a comical creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, that ludicrous secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe the melting glamour around him, but appears as a mix of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unfortunate one-note musician at the opening concert in London in 2012.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mysterious man of the world who left chaos behind, who was portrayed by Atkinson in Barclaycard's TV commercials, which were originally forgotten.
The latest show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and his helmet is hit by rotor blades.
Atkinson's gifts of physical comedy come out, but the humor itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because 'serious' film brands like 007 and Dangerous Task now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
The humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English's craziness does not strike me as as inventive and shrewd as the comedy of Mr. Bean's silent roles by Atkinson.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents operating in the field to the dismay of an agent on duty — which is portrayed as an unfortunate low performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a pompous and intractable prime minister, who is already in the middle of political disfavor: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can in the skins of a Teresa May parody character, but the script just doesn't give her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all the spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already left active service must be called in.
Of course, it's a screwy Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a teacher at a fancy school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject sparks some clever jokes; English holds school of rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he reunites with his endlessly patient partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to get her rights.
Thus, disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's Secret Service to face Ophelia Bhuletova, the fatal supervillain played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is about to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey instantly turns into a farce: a duo disguised as waiters sets a fine French restaurant on fire and causes chaos as they secretly pursue Volta's luxury yacht. The attempt to explore Volta's house with the help of virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
The authors' final blockages will fade as they enter the final scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a bit like it was made for a child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English films, I have come to the same conclusion before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week for five days' pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the pay would be paid for five days.
The party is reported to demand from business leaders that the savings generated by the AI revolution be passed on to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "fit" the party's economic program and its plans for tilting policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A source for the High-Level Labour Party tells the Sunday Times: "The revision of the policy was expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Change doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the transition to a four-day working week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the goal does not receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party states, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy, and the party is not considering moving to one."
John McDonnell, the finance minister of the shadow government, used a labor conference last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from "faceless dictators" and "speculators" of utility companies.
Under the plans of the shadow government finance minister, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recoup their share in full, because the Labour-led government could implement "reductions" based on perceived abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employee control, with a maximum annual dividend of £500 per employee.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The investigation into the allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In the 60 Minutes episode on Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible that the FBI could find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing... I said I've had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the accusations came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?'
He was determined, decisive, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks set in stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's a sure thing," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know the following: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named could confirm it.
It's a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event with a performing cast as impressive as its mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now taking place for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to New York's Central Park lawns to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the event's true goal: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Founded in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively working to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "works" such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision maker or making a call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project's goals.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that there are only 12 years left to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just another ‘clicktivism’ among others — an illusion that you can change the world by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" in favor of various goals since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles that are equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been spent in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements that have already been used or raised more than $10 billion.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have been affected by the funds so far.
The most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to "helping children develop to their full potential". The group committed to deliver $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments in different countries, and world citizens just like you, we can shift social injustice and malnutrition to the pages of history," Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told audiences at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also said the British government was urged to take action to improve maternal and child nutrition with more than 5,000 actions. The government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which targets 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions column on the store's website is, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's answer: "The road will be long and difficult and there are many stumbling blocks ahead of us.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we will be stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the movement's New York concert this year, and its star cast includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, the country can make it difficult to export energy by using the fleet as a "barrier"
According to Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington can "if necessary" rely on its navy to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the global market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's actions in Syria — at the invitation of the legitimate government — are an excuse for exploring new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason for [Russia's] presence in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, the southern half of Europe," Zinke is quoted as saying.
According to the office holder, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep shipping routes open with the help of its fleet and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up on the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Union, a non-profit group that is profiled as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same issue.
"The economic alternative of Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one-trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements date back to a situation where the Trump administration has sought to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace the much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas with it.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, ties Berlin to the Moscow leash.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic metre transmission capacity of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and sees it as an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," says Alexander Novak, the Russian Energy Minister, after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has caused a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella organisation, the Confederation of German Industries, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Confederation of German Industry, said recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully" about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "consider carefully" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed he was considering a candidacy at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our faulty administration, and this also means a woman in the leadership position of the kingdom," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think carefully about running for president."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that "he's taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released Friday, Warren wrote, "I guess we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to an opinion poll released on Thursday, a majority of Warren's voters do not support this nomination in 2020.
According to a study by the Suffolk University Department of Policy Studies and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts do not support a senator running.
32% were in favor of running.
More respondents were in favor of former governor Deval Patrick running for office with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates raised in the debates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war traumas at Donald Trump election rally
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"From what my son has to go through when he returns home, I can relate well to the other families who have to face the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers carry," he told an audience gathered in Tulsa, Oklahoma for Donald Trump's election.
Palin called the arrest "a hippopotamus in the living room" and said his son, like other war veterans, "will return home slightly altered, they will return hardened, they will return wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country will be respected."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are seeking a change to a new policy that entered into force in the United States that asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and federal districts have filed a "Friends of Justice" letter Friday in Washington, D.C., to support asylum seekers who violate the policy, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He says he was assaulted by his partner "and his sons from a violent gang" and was denied asylum by U.S. authorities on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large proportion of the U.S. asylum seekers come from, as states where gang and domestic violence is a widespread problem at all levels of society.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Appeals for Asylum that undocumented migrants may have applied for asylum on the grounds of domestic violence.
District Attorney Karl Racine of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal, and international law for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances specific to the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the letter says.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practice that prevents asylum seekers from entering harms the U.S. economy, as the newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring in the necessary additional labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is intended for persons who flee their homeland because of persecution or fear caused by belonging to a race, religion, nationality, or a particular social class or political opinion," Sessions announced in a statement on the new asylum practice on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems — even the serious ones — that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate Survivors Rescue Continues in Palu — Death toll has already doubled
For the survivors, the situation becomes more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she calms her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulances bring in new bodies every minute.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their wet things, and try to salvage what is still salvageable.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spine and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, strong aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he recounts how a furious earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and says that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'provoking' with 'propaganda declarations'
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using an American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid annex of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional election. China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the U.S. election mark a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to pressure China, according to U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread notices to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an ever-evolving trade war in which both sides in turn impose tariffs on the opposing party's exports.
According to Chinese and American experts, China's retaliatory tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa at the start of the trade war that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa state, says Beijing has done damage to U.S. labor, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now further accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," Branstad wrote in an opinion piece published on Sunday's Des Moines Register.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the esteemed traditions of free speech and the press in the United States by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, the newsstands on Beijing streets show only limited dissent, and the real, dissenting opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's largest newspapers sidestepped the offer to publish" the article he wrote, but does not specify what the magazine is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top Republican names are standing behind and defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, according to analysts, may cause a counter-reaction, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been in big swings, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," says Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell Institute, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake's (Republicans, Arizona) last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they demonstrated in the corridors of the Senate with the ruling Republicans of the Judiciary Committee deciding to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination, which happened despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be assessable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if Republicans proceed with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is going to be a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former spokesman for the Republican National Committee on NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be questioned; it's about how the Republicans have acted and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, leader of the Democratic-backed Priorities USA group, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, with the narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll conducted by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or likely, while 35% say they absolutely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushed the matter forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh molested him when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitals to him at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new Internet as backlash to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored, and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's purpose is to "rule the world."
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data warehouse", or POD.
It may include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what types of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some paid developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt's website. This is all available starting this week.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss "with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change where all their business models are turned on their heads overnight."
"We will not ask for their consent."
In an article in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote of Inrupt's "task to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new Solid built network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute even after Inrupt was launched.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only priest in the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross Medal, as a soldier, 100 years after the events.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918, following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Vann, however, died a sniper was created four days later without ever knowing of the highest British Army honor he received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in very dense fog and under heavy field gun and machine gun fire."
Later, he plunged into the front line and, "with the greatest of bravery," led the advance of the troops before storming the field gun alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper bullet on October 4, 1918 — just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve, something that evokes respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann laid a wreath after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honor to be able to take part in the parade" and added, "a great number of people are commemorating the honor of a true hero."
Friends of mixed martial arts waited up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament — the TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you've been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event isn't shown.
The San Jose event was scheduled to feature 13 matches, including six major matches, and the show was scheduled to air live on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for the ring, the show switched to Pipsa Pig to the great dismay of viewers.
Some viewers weren't exactly happy to have been up all night for the match.
A friend of the mixed martial arts opened up on Twitter, describing the match as a "sick joke of some kind" of a child's cartoon.
"According to the law, the content in question was not suitable to be presented at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to change it to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications for the program change.
"Pipsa Pig, Yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that the schedules will be worked on so that UK viewers can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of rebroadcasting, which is probably going to make the program work," Coker said.
"However, it's six o'clock in the morning there and we can't get the show aired until Sunday our time, which in turn is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that as the program changed in their heads, messages started going one way and the other and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We're limiting the number of games to five instead of six, as usual, trying to offer our fans more and trying too hard.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivated his success.
The 24-year-old athlete says that he only noticed when he entered secondary school that "not everyone is like me".
Daley, who spoke on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs show hosted by Lauren Laverne, says he spoke about gay rights to give others 'hope'.
He also tells how after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, a regular host of a long-running radio show, has taken several months off due to illness.
While appearing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he was young because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and work."
"Until this day, these feelings, feeling less and different, have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and the energy I have needed to be successful."
She says she wanted to show that she was ‘something’ so that she wouldn’t disappoint everyone once her sexuality was finally revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and will appear at this year's Commonwealth Games in an appeal to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to live openly with no consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope' to other people.
The three-time world champion recounts his falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "comes as a surprise."
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age" — he participated in his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — "it's hard to find another person of the same age who has experienced the same kind of pros and cons," Daley says.
The couple had a son in June — Robert Ray Black-Daley — as a result of which Daley's "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than a gold Olympic medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 of brain cancer at the age of just 40.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about tickets to the 2012 Olympics.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there to be in the front row anymore," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. It wasn't until her breathing had really stopped and she was dead that I finally understood that she wasn't invulnerable," she says.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of my whole life — jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also the inspiration for her first song choice on the air — Heather Small's song "Proud" — which evoked emotion even as she was preparing for the Olympics, and which is still making her skin crawl.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to make a substantial effort to avoid the record round going down in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays every two years in the event for the record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for fourball and foursome on Saturday.
Usually the center of attention, the American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to get his swing.
The 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course, where the long-growing roughshod punishes inaccurate strokes.
If Mickelson doesn't have enough resistance in the field himself, Sunday's ninth game will face well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play alongside newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, who aim to put all four wins on the streak this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind by the time they reach 12 doubles, get a flying start, Michelson's game could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, crunched and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is undeniably one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined otherwise, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came up with.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, though it was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefinable to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy that everybody likes to be around," he explains.
"The younger players must have had a lot of fun with him this week, too, which is fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game."
European Team Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows How Long Headship Can Disappear Quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup's massive lead before the last day's doubles can become a bumpy ride.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who came out victorious on the lime lines just by the size of his nose and won by the narrowest margin possible141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"It reminds itself of how we led briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit sparingly," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-1 victories both Friday and yesterday, taking a 10-2 lead at Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we shoot with a big calibre.
We go to the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only for that.
As I've always said, I'm going to focus on these 12 players who are playing for us, but we're aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at how his team's players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until I drop in on things like this.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow, the priority will be individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It is great to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you are alone on the field, then the player's capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that must be conveyed to the players - tomorrow everyone will be able to perform for the best.
Now you have to give up the partner who is allowed to go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require his players to perform better as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three out of four points.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the turnarounds of the last day in both directions. He was part of the team that won at Brookline before ending up a loser when the European team won with the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw extended his team's ranks to the final day's kicks.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened in Brookline, or like it happened in Medinah.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our line-up accordingly and we will put the boys on the field as we wish, as you know, we are going to do wonders tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead a defensive battle and faces Rory McIlroy in the main game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in line to face their European opponents.
"I put the guys in the group in this order because I think it carries the whole tournament through," Bjorn commented on his singles choices.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014. The ship is intended to replace obsolete Cold War equipment, but it will not be commissioned until next year due to faulty systems and exponentially increasing costs, local media reports say.
According to a military spokesman speaking to Die Zeit, the commissioning of ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin', the first ship of the new class of Baden-Württemberg frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying back-order problems have haunted the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to the information available, they will be equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems for air and surface vessel control, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal reduction technology.
Another important feature of the ship is its longer service life - new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port at times.
However, the continued delays mean that state-of-the-art warships — said to enhance German influence in overseas territories — are already obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in the German media of essential "software and equipment failures" that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half the crew size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's chances of later upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tons, the Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag for the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a stunning sum of €3.1 billion, compared to the original price of €2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have surfaced as German naval power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable vessels "are running out".
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old vessels have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to be commissioned by the fleet.
Environmental organization eavesdrops on bats' hidden lives
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
The new research is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future conservation efforts.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland is looking at pestle and dwarf bats, as well as earworts and waterfowl in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the activity of bats during the season.
The organization's employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the pronunciations, as well as the species in question, are ensured by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report are created in which the behaviour of the bats can be shown in an image that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats, and how they are exploited by different species.
The information helps with the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
The bat populations of Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined considerably in the last 100 years.
Construction and earthworks threaten the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
Bats use advanced echolocation technology to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization dedicated to the protection of the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country — and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, rest-place inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only protected area dedicated to the protection of bats on the land of Threave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway region, where eight of Scotland's ten species of bats are found.
According to groundskeeper David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave suits bats very well," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
Not everything is known about the bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us better understand what the bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before undertaking restoration work, as the destruction of one of the bats' resting places can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and obliterate an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bats Protection Association, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with the rape of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for nondisclosure, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram live to 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer flatly rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, fake news," a five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I'm a happy man and all is well," the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they have called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns."
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is demanding compensation for "mental suffering according to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met in a nightclub and moved into the player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to papers submitted to the Nevada Clark County Regional Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent good guy", but whose "1 percent" disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited a police station and taken photographs of his injuries in the hospital, but later reached a settlement because he was "horrified about the possibility of revenge" and worried "that he would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to signing for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus on a $100 million contract.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' end of car manufacturing
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he found the announcement by Toyota's UK unit to temporarily suspend production at its plant near Burnaston, Derby, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, "concerned".
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese automaker says the impact of border delays will be visible as job losses if Brexit is ended without a deal.
The factory in Burnaston — where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are produced — produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK abruptly leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be disruptions to our factory production," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union on how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its manufacturing plant for a month when Brexit comes to fruition.
The main concern, according to car manufacturers, is the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT principle, with parts arriving at the plant every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and EU, and the cars are made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Holding a warehouse for more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, Toyota said, and production would be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal possible, which not only means success in the current situation, but it's an opportunity we have to take advantage of," he says on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"Not only the statements of Toyota, but also those of other manufacturers, show that we absolutely must be able to continue the series of supply chains that have worked very well so far."
Toyota does not know how long production will be halted, but warns that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union official at the factory, says of concern among the growing members: "In my experience, lost jobs never come back.
A government spokesman says, "We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may "have to be rescheduled another week" due to the buzz around Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference in the election, Trump's aides' ties to Russia, and the president's possible actions to obstruct justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump intends to fire the Assistant Attorney General, which would compromise the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of the president being dismissed under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied any information in the report.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reportedly Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so the day of the meeting was announced as Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its timing coincided with a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said, "The date for this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it could be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is for reasons other than his dislike of TV reporters' "attention" but said, "I don't dispute the fact that they're attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, indicated that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more poll hours than any president before him," he says, adding further evidence without quoting, "We've checked those numbers."
"Press conferences will still be held," Sanders said, "but it is infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We often try to act this way and you have seen us act this way several times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York City, the president possibly pointed out the reason for this, appearing uninhibited and at times strange to reporters gathered there.
Health Minister writes letter to Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) workers from EU countries over fears over Brexit
The Health Minister has written a letter to Scottish health workers from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for them to stay in the country after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of the "established" status of EU citizens working with specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes the following: During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennessee reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to the side for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/extent of the injury at this point," and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University and will play his first season on the team from Illinois after his transfer.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used, according to the Conservative Party's new plans, to help the homeless.
The change is intended to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will be announcing today a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of more affordable housing and paid attention to the taxation of the well-off.
The increase in stamp duty will be targeted at people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money from this will be diverted to government measures to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the two-apartment and investment-apartment increases, could be as high as three percent.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents, which raises prices and makes it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the owner-occupied housing market.
Many affluent areas of the UK — particularly its capital — have become ‘ghost cities’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to make it easier for young people to buy first homes.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas on low-cost housing to remedy Britain's "infamy of housing".
Corbyn has published an eye-catching series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and an end to "productive evictions".
He would also like to give the councils more power in matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says, "I said last year that I intended to dedicate my Prime Ministership to the restoration of the British Dream — that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies located abroad, can buy housing as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become far too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge to bring the Northeast corner of the country back to its feet. The team is currently in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the "stadion of lights" this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I made team two and that's it," Ross told BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"When I was a kid, I used to watch Scottish games with my dad at Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
Such an opportunity will only come if I succeed as manager of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic director says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his illustrious predecessors in a prestigious club. He has previously rejected offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I am measuring my own success by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the club's structure and ability, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could pilot the team back to the Premier League."
Ross has only been manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's assistant manager and then for 15 months in the Heats' coaching group.
He then helped Alloa to rise from the Series 3 playoffs and raised St Mirren from a falling condition to champions during the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career with teams from Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a crossroads with my career," he recalls the time he took over Alloa.
"I really thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a fair amount of money, and was able to enjoy some of the relatively large successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I still go through the same things, like stress and the pressure of work, but team management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing it for a living, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever felt in my adult life."
The full interview will be available for streaming on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows
The summer heat wave has given a boost to pubs struggling with Britain's difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, who compiled the figures, from CGA, a business consulting firm, says: "Continuous sunny weather and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July turned out to be like June, with pub sales being 2.8% higher, while the month was even worse for restaurants.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-focused pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than restaurant operators.
It seems that people wanted out with just drinking in mind.
Sales of corporate-run pubs and bar beverages increased 6.6% over the month, with food sales down three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM, a leisure and hospitality consulting company, says: "The results continue the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors influencing the sales of the out-of-home meal market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8% annual drop in sales stings, especially now that the industry is struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come for operators focused on food in a worse seam, and only time will tell if August's milder temperatures will bring the industry much needed respite.
The combined total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the establishment of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer of sales in the pub, bar and restaurant industry in the UK, which compiles and analyses performance data from 47 groups in the industry with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is considered a reliable measure of the industry.
One-fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
A fifth of children — some as young as 11 — hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, the study says.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of a growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts'
The news raised concerns that accounts could be used to share sexually explicit content
20% of students said they hold a ‘main account’ to be shown to parents
A fifth of children — some as young as 11 — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of fast-growing 'Instagram fake accounts', which refers to an Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content can be published on accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they keep a cleaned ‘main account' for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager wishing to be raped after she ran into her 13-year-old daughter on a secret website.
A study commissioned by Digital Awareness UK and the Rectors' Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40 percent of young people aged 11 to 18 kept two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle on "Athletes' Voice" for Scottish Athletes' Government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athlete's Board, taking part in the Governing Body's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete. Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive, international-level experience that the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidh is hugely respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as the mouthpiece for athletes and hope I can be useful and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction."
The four Olympic gold medal-winning American athlete who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient cerebral circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time will tell if I am recovering and in what condition.
This has been exhausting work, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advert that equates mothers with cows shares opinions online
An advertisement that equates breastfeeding mothers of breast pumps with dairy cows has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is boosted by a tongue-in-cheek advertisement that reflects the style of music videos, describing the freedom that the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life moms dance in a hay-filled barn, including the following song lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but the tail isn't visible" and "If you didn't happen to notice, they're not udders, they're tits".
The chorus continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused discussion online.
The video, which has garnered 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has elicited mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it is making fun of the dairy industry's daily 'horror'.
"Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them soon after they give birth," one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented, "Understandably, it's traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why couldn't they be used to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"
The third commentator added, "A perfectly reality-obsessed ad."
The advert also got defenders: one woman admitted that she thought the advert was "fun".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often in the workplace or toilets) and 'feel like cows'.
The purpose of the ad is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the advert, the women in the video reveal that they have danced with inconspicuous pumps stuffed into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and fits discreetly inside the nursing vest, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of the Mother advertising agency, commented on the controversy: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using a breast pump to the spotlight, bringing out the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in an entertaining and recognizable way."
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children performed on a catwalk in designer Marta Jakubowski's outfit using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children transferred to Texas border tent camp in silence
The number of captured migrant children has increased sharply, despite the relatively unchanged monthly number of border crossings, partly because of the difficulty in placing children in foster families as a result of the crude rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration.
Most foster families are traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants, and enrolling as a foster family can put their own stay in the country at risk.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the household must provide their fingerprints, and that this information will be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs official, testified in Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be foster families for underage immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with children's cases, authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases, the case must be heard in court within a month of being apprehended, instead of the 60-day time limit previously in place, reception centre employees say.
Many prefer to appear through videoconference rather than in person when pursuing their case in a court of law dealing with immigrant affairs.
Those who are not considered eligible for assistance will be deported as a matter of urgency.
According to reports released by reception center employees and the system in recent months, the amount of time children spend in captivity affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that the concern is particularly acute in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's desperation may go unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many of the children are already suffering trauma.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupiers" to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is at war for the eighth year.
Moulamem, who is also acting as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally in the country under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Mouleem claimed the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy fight until the whole of Syria is purged" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign troops."
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Arab forces against the Kurds and President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed a contingent of more than 1,000 soldiers in the fighting-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mouleem said conditions were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until the end of the war has been agreed upon by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the rebels' last base in Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on an area inhabited by three million people.
However, Mouleem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra front fighters, "who will be annihilated."
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a committee of new government and opposition members to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moulem placed conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against meddling.
Why Trump Will Be Elected to a Second Term
In keeping with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the suspension and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential decision ever!"
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached a peak of 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a blaze that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's Designated Survivor program, about the minister who will rise to the presidency after the attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade story goes, whether members of immigrant families get to each other, and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duties of the conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour of an expert panel debating the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot coat (according to the Washington Post, "an arrogant piece of clothing"), and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' unvarnished descriptions of President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I will never be able to watch Super Mario the way I used to.
"What he's doing feels like a reality show, because in part it's about him giving the audience something every night," says Brent Montgomery, president of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pledge Shop series about the changing characters and daily changing plot twists on Trump's show (NFL controversy, Kim Jong-un's praise).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached out to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a lovely sunny day at his place on the North Coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not disengage from the program in which Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Judiciary Committee and this was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows and people saying it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money flowing from the outside for a tight midterm election struggle
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district has faced a real cash flow, as the reorganization of congressional districts means that two already elected candidates will have to fight for one seat.
This newly reshuffled Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his seat from another constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb is in competition with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The territorial division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has sparked an economic struggle in the main party finance departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar in Pennsylvania after the widely-followed March special election of Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been in the Republican seat for over ten years and President Donald Trump won the area by 20%.
Political commentators have given Democrats a slight head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backed down on its intentions.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild response from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama "on the basis of recent policies that no longer recognize Taiwan," said department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and financial aid.
The penalties proposed, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country badly, with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a similar meeting in the previous year seen as a step in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administrators made it clear that the meeting wanted to move forward and this effectively ended speculation about possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the mid-October meeting some indication of the weight the administration will place on the gathering, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without further unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on details of a conversation with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the protection of the anonymity clause.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now very weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be heading for an investigation into whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia interfered in the U.S. election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs here, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's defeat is inevitable - any more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the ensuing massacre of years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, where the inevitable advance of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been grilled ever since news came out that he had proposed secret recording of the president's speech and wondered about the president's possible inability to carry out his duties.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recently called FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will go through a long and dark winter.
But I believe our success is due to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light sabbatical candles on that swastika-adorned table.
How can I be anything but optimistic about the future with this legacy?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that after a draw against Villarreal earlier that month in Spain, a win over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to reach Group G of the Europa League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting on the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," the 31-year-old player says.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
Maybe we would have been able to catch the win at the end, but overall a draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got up to speed in the second and we were better.
Thursday is another important night in the Europa League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because their score was good in the previous game, but I think with the support of this team we'll be able to give our all and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The composition is good and the boys enjoy; the training goes well.
I hope we can now push it to the full, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement savings robs women of their sleep
Although the study participants had a clear vision of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had talked to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study reported discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't bring it up," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk to a professional and your family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important cost factor.
Involve financial advisors in the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term care financing options may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-funded insurance, if you can afford it.
Prepare legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative on the scene so you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drawing up a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of your financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Remember also the small details: imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just the financial side, who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medications are being used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police describe the attack, which took place at about 2:30 a.m., as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, officials say the death toll is expected to increase.
Since communications to the area have been cut off, rescue authorities have received no information from the Donggala municipal area north of Palu, which is closer to the surface center of the magnitude 7.5 quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu since the disaster.
Key facts about Pala and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
An earthquake and a tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary celebrations.
The municipality of Donggala extends for more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the island of Sulawesi along the coastal line of the northwestern part.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative region under the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities in the Central Sulawesi province and especially in the Donggala coastal region are fishing and farming.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck the southern side of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands of Sumatra, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya region, causing havoc and panic as people remember the massive damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaska police, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as preventing and resisting a domestic violence report when arrested.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone call from her female companion when she tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial detention facility and a bail of $500 has been set, reports TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "certainly innocent".
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B violation, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a gun under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the middle of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos circulating from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing rare death penalty on NYC terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist who claimed the lives of eight people in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been enforced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the indictment, Saipov, 30, used a Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the New York Southern District Death Penalty filing, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors are able to show that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight of his victims and "deliberately" caused serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges could be punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this crime title in cases related to organized crime. In addition, the charges included charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation," prosecutors noted and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as "horrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm, and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the indictment statement states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the New York Southern District Court handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-point charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life without the possibility of release is a solution that will only prolong the trauma these events have caused to those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously requested that he not be required to pay the death penalty.
A Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today at a rally against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
The former UKIP leader said politicians need to feel pressure from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative lineman Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Britain would "be out" if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But May faces a challenge, underlined by conservatives in favor of staying, in the face of a separate anti-Brexit rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat under pressure from Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as the EU.
Supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and the chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "thrash the Chequers proposal away."
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
A Wellingborough MP added, "I'm in favour of Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He voiced his opposition to the EU, stating: "We did not fight the world wars to end up as subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British had changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely false claim."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative Brexit supporter, also attended the march and told reporters, "All I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists who really take to the streets and are responsible for our success in the first place.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added, "Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to feel the pressure if they are to reverse the decision taken following the 2016 referendum.
This is about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water down Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want politicians who are about to reverse Brexit to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Great Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's app at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get the IT systems in order and all the technology for the Canada plus plus arrangement and the frictionless border functions for the free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she is seriously considering running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported a Massachusetts Democrat speaking about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, faces Republican Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign, in a re-election in November.
Warren is expected to run against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th town hall meeting with voters since the start of Trump's term.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren responded that now is the time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest place."
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting case
Louisiana Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the Friday shooting that led to the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during interrogation that he was present, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist when arrested and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 6'4" junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes team arrangements play an important role in the race.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost on his own as he defended his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pits first and left Hamilton to drive the crowd by the tail, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pits a round later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton moved by after making some contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inside line, giving up defending his position after only two thirds turn moves.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of much of the race while prolonging the tire change in pursuit of a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually came to the pit in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed in the remaining eight laps as Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a true gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, achieving a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
At a speech on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was evidence of people's "nasty, viciousness, and dishonesty."
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer...did you year the document - ‘oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Are we...No, we didn't leak," he added, sneering at the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he wished."
But his ban was not good enough for the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday's occasion: "I'll tell you, that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought the Democrats would use the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to get back into power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and viciousness, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule," the mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars claimed compensation for the loss of Friday's Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard evened out for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the win.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m. from a pitch by Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic opening episode, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched the Cowns' handicap goal in 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first period break when he hit his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team gathered their ranks and Bouchard again tied with a power goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to score Dundee's first lead at the end of the second period. He also secured a win on his team's fifth goal midway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will next face Milton Keynes at home on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed while making sure hundreds of passengers on board escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller has become a hero since his death, as he ensured that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers was safely airborne.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing after a powerful earthquake and the resulting tsunami hit Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are hitting the area and several people have been trapped among the fallen material in the town of Palu.
Although the co-workers escaped at the risk of their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation at the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained still and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, currently on the runway, was safely airborne.
He then jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
A helicopter was prepared from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Return.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll will rise to thousands, as the country's disaster authorities have reported a lack of contact with the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in the rubble and not many people have been reached," said Sutopo Purwo, a spokesperson for the agency.
Waves up to six metres high have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring assistance and equipment to the area.
35-year-old housewife Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
In an interview with CNN, International Red Cross Indonesia director Jan Gelfand said: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may turn out to be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to get all the tasks related to the evacuation done.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person missing after plane crashes in lagoon
Representatives of the airline of the plane that crashed into the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now report one person missing, although earlier reports indicated that all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
According to Air Niugin, it has not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it would try to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six people remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had run over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade in the sinking plane in waist-deep water to emergency exits.
He reported that the passenger staff panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on repairs to a nearby wharf were involved in rescue work by transporting people to shore in a rubber boat before the aircraft sank into water about 30 feet (100 feet) deep.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents timeline for night when woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded a retrial in which the man was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used data stored on a mobile phone to piece together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night the victim died.
Rowlett said he had received location information from several mobile phones that indicated Tellis was in violation of his previous claims with Chambers on the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' mobile phone was at Chambers' at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "lies because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the records on their mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls, and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her from his life," Hale said.
The defense's closing arguments are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the resurgence of Great Britain with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
New York nanny sues couple over racist text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "again one dark-skinned".
The couple denies being racist and equates the challenge with "blackmail."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her annoyance when Giselle Maurice, a new nanny, arrived at work on her first day at work in 2016 and it dawned on her that she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, DARK AGAIN," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, she then sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
Realizing the mistake he had made, Plasco-Flaxman, according to the New York Post, had fired Maurice, announcing that their previous departure-passed African-American nanny had done her job poorly and this time had expected a Filipino.
Maurice was paid for one of his work days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and wants $350 per day for the six months he was originally hired to live and work in the family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to the racist allegations, saying that ending Maurice's employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after hurting him.
"My wife sent him something he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post in an interview.
"But would you leave your child in the care of someone you've been unkind to, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and I said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in "a very difficult situation."
"Are we going to start chasing another in a situation like this?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, scuttling their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared audiences wouldn't identify with talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born not long after the book was approved, says of the letter: "It is difficult to empathize with the position of the person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of the toy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books felt bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
He "described Paddington as a very important family member" and stated that his father was quietly proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a swaggering guy at all," the daughter says.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one you're proud of, even though it's not really your own accomplishment.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice after the plane landed, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and telling me it was really bad that he wasn't expected to make it," Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said that my daughter is going to die in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs with which doctors kept his heart running gradually disappeared from his system.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing it was all running out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to hold myself together."
Eventually, mourning the loss of his daughter, Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane among the other passengers - who knew nothing of the ordeal he was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Grieving Women Send Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to get support.
Davis' son, Tyler, suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile lights up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt "in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's always afraid of aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you have to talk."
Humphreys has been friends with Davies for several years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
He notes that Mark's death was a difficult trauma for them, but they still have to survive: "It's going to break up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get what he wanted - a limited time and scope investigation - we could maybe get some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break down" into a deadlock caused by supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and met through him his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
The Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow the game off and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors drops during Kimi's time
South Korean lawmaker says the number of people who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification and reported that there were 1,127 defections last year - 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the decisive factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in the prices of human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
Most North Korean defectors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and in most cases forcibly returns them.
Technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea, still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on stalled talks over the dismantling of the nuclear armament.
This followed a June historic meeting at which U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed in general terms on an effort toward nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the sanctions being stuck after the meeting.
"Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances we will by no means unilaterally begin to dismantle our armaments first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied accusations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was overwhelmed by his emotions and at times he almost screamed and lost the ability to speak when he told about his family and high school years.
He also clearly denounced the committee's Democratic members without calling the accusations against themselves "grotesque and systematic persecution of the person" orchestrated by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered when asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats got a majority in the House.
"Let's just say - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's currently working for," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently works for the United States Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible regulations on health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected as a member of the court and for us to be expected to say that it is wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It's a legitimate fire talk with months and years of rage swirling over it, and she can't hold it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual at all, do you?"
He continued, "I was helped tremendously by a woman who was in a leadership position somewhere and told me that she too was crying when she got angry, but that she had developed a way of saying to her talk partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying: "You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a path of venting rage, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is when I once wept wordlessly with rage and an older woman - a cold-tempered superior I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me to the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and that's when they're happy because they made you feel bad."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught having an extramarital affair in 1987 on a boat called Monkey Business and was forced out of the race, a highly frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least needed one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
As the campaign period was already well advanced, he was behind in fundraising and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his backers, who gave the male candidates a thousand dollars, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'll get some discount?" he thought.
When he delivered his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his emotions - a system of gratitude for his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work on voters and not on delegates, and animosity for sexism - that he was unable to speak.
"You might have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the reactions of the press.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking they're probably going to chop up my headstone as an obituary.
‘She was crying.'"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The starting shot at the U.S.-China trade war was deafening and while the battle is far from over, a break between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's top export articles, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods to the tune of $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing has responded every time in kind, most recently by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American imports.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-for-eye fashion, and it does not seem that the world's second-largest economic power is slowing down for a moment.
To get Washington to back down, one would have to give in to one's own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays its cards right, the U.S. trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing dependency between the two countries.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that start an economic downward spiral in either country and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than bystanders have so far understood," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant with the Center for New American Security in Asia.
Syria's foreign minister says country is 'ready' for refugees to return
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
Circumstances now allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the one-sided economic actions that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team by 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National course outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team retained the crown when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team achieved the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament and hit his first punch in the water at the 16 hole of the par-3 track, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournaments began in their current form in 1979.
America's Jordan Spieth came out with a 5&4 against Denmark's Thorbjørn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
Ranked as the world's top player, Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time winning European with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could be of help," said a moved Garcia after the win for the European team.
He transfers the torch to his compatriot Jon Rahm, who beat U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in individual competitions played on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding pathways throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a high level of play throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after the failed performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I have to lift my hat.
We met our winners."
Red tide algal bloom situation: concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota regions
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report, algae levels are showing a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more scattered areas of algae are reported from areas in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier counties, possibly indicating a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide algal blooms stretch along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be spotted ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but are fewer than last week.
Red tide algal blooms have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, concentrations ranging from low to high along the coasts of Hillsborough County, from background levels to high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota County, from background levels to moderate levels in Charlotte County, and from background levels to high concentrations along the coasts of Lee County and Collier County were low in lengths.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
In the past week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
