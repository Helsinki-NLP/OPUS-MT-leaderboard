28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase at a local mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally gotten his affairs in order."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco-based Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Medicine.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said the death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small, tight-knit team, like a family.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia reports that Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally gotten his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into an argument with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the flow.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the incident is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Strike junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of Britain's junior doctors (who are mainly responsible for specializing doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and asked for permission for new industrial action in a dispute over a new employment contract.
The British Trade Union of Doctors (BMA) Junior Medical Officers Committee (JDC) is seeking support from its entire government for further industrial action from early September.
According to the JDC, the ministers have not resolved any problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with the BMA in a July vote.
58% of the members who voted rejected the agreement.
The chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, posted a letter to JDC members on Twitter on Thursday night, saying the government "shut up" on issues that McCourt said led to the agreement being rejected.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject an entirely new draft treaty and insists that new formal negotiations be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government asking for permission for incremental industrial action from early September."
Due to the controversy, junior doctors have already been on strike six times this year, including the first complete stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawina, director of junior doctors at the BMA, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract that had been recommended by the BMA.
Malawina told BMA members at the pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and formally end an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin met his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides shook hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't see much warmth even by his own restrained standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin — according to one report, five times.
I myself did not keep count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would be restored even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant chill about Putin showed that the Russian head hasn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin, with firm words, attacked Ankara and accused him of stabbing him in the back.
The insult was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
Regaining true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media waged a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were allegations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has profited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has emphatically denied the allegations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting was only held so that Putin could receive the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Thus, Russia could have some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring an armistice are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was nearly deposed last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also a financial motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has plummeted by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies are sure to breathe a sigh of relief as air travel can finally be resumed.
They place their faith in the late-season rush into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," an article in the finance magazine Vedemost said.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it feels that the West is reacting subduedly to the attempted coup.
Not forgetting the old resentment about the snail-speeding EU accession negotiations with Turkey and Putin's interference. Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool relations and erode Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader no doubt won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own entrenched concern about the change of power.
Thus, at their summit meeting in the gaudy seaside palace, Russia and Turkey were able to convey a picture described by one analyst as "an alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created an image of itself as a peace-builder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told a press conference that they had not covered the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of the countries' disagreements, while Putin in turn emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus among the two countries as to where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a full-scale disaster caused by a NATO member Turkey shooting down a Russian fighter jet, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are again even on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the president of RBS, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced to providing only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank had to back down from its goals when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, including Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let more national brands into the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but is not abbreviated as RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted to NatWest, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and the one our staff are working for because we are now turning into a bank of much more diverse brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby, and has raised the profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because the bottom line is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's president.
"Three years ago, it would have been very sneering if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and adopted brands.
But the work we do and the focus on customer needs instead of our own has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory at Newmarket and achieved his 3,000th win
The Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, marking his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night at the track of his own locality. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in flat track races.
He has previously been joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are all over the place because my family is here, too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and an audience of 20,000 people.
I am relieved and I feel great humility."
Dettori receives cheers with Predilection after his win
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the barrier race, being champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it's no surprise that he was the one who reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical prowess is what sets him apart from the rest.
He is a fantastic representative for racing, his enthusiasm and pruning have brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races by now if he didn't only race on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been a triumph for nearly 30 years, which has been a great thing to watch.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but most of all he's an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori aired his achievement in a distinctive way by frantically jumping off his horse.
"From flying finishers to flying downs, Frankie Dettori has been a prime example of British racing for two decades.
The trip has accommodated ups and downs.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 in the "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and been banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban came to an end three years ago, he initially had trouble starting, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his doubters, and returned to his best.
And he won't be finishing his career for a while yet — Dettori has recently said he wants to continue racing until he's at least 50."
Putin fired chief of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a statement issued by the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, who has served as Ivanov's deputy manager since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later headed the presidential protocol department and the government office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
In my opinion, the most important function of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for resignation and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close associate of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As head of administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the position at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, few people are convinced by the explanations, especially in the run-up to the general election.
Are the firings the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious of the official claim that a man who is lauded as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy.
Ivanov's words to Putin are presented on the Kremlin's website, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very complex and, to some extent, even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been the President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov assumed the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) that replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected to a third term.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin's entourage, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to the presidency just three and a half years later.
'Criminal Minds' Star Thomas Gibson Fired After Beating Producer
Gibson was involved in a violent altercation on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced the dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner on the show, had made an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I regret that this has happened," he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the series following FBI agents will be released later, according to a press release from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, who previously played Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
"I was hoping to see the show through to the end, but that's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our amazing production team and most important of all: the best fans the show could have ever hoped for."
The 12th season of the series begins on September 28 in the United States.
The Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are sand eels that have been stranded on land by a cyclone.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the seashore, posted footage of the vision on Periscope and hoped to get a response to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
The Queensferry overpass is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck and land bridge of the Queensferry overpass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "deck fans", which are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted wire rope.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of State for Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from land to bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, with over 30,000 concrete and steel used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, Project Manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: "The completion of the first section of the bridge is always a major urinal in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this section represents the pinnacle of the road and civil engineering industry.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the road deck of the North Tower, we then had to close the remaining north side (i.e., ground) gap.
This was done by pulling a north-facing land bridge 700 millimetres southward.
This was a massive and at the same time high-precision operation.
Massive because the land bridge is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an angle of gradient of about 3%.
And demanding high accuracy, because the tolerances that the work team had to comply with were very small — just a few millimeters.
Thankfully, all went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department reports three men miraculously rescued
Three men caught in the water off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey miraculously escaped.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made an alert at 1:20 p.m. local time on Friday after its crew spotted an accident in Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a pilot.
"We saw the boat go around right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we reached the waters, the strong winds had fortunately carried the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted clinging to a buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up in a coastal rescue boat and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who were caught in the water are still alive and perfectly fine.
The boat's engine had an emergency fire-extinguishing cord, but for some reason it had been disconnected from the man who was driving the boat during the crash.
They were really lucky in their journey."
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go gets people off the couch and on the move.
Originally screen time was only taken up by watching TV, then came video games and most recently smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor exercise are not mutually exclusive.
Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (later also made into a cartoon series, playing cards and other merchandise).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this one also dropped shortly before the new game became available in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as high as on Twitter.
So how does the game work?
Briefly explained, players go out to search for pokémon on their smartphones, which are tracked using GPS. When a pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (using the phone's screenshot) or "captured".
The ferocity has dragged along a generation of younger video gamers and lifted their butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average person" takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported, on the Cardiogram app for the Apple Watch smartwatch, which found within two days of the game's launch, that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day rose abruptly from 45% to 53%.
The company doesn't know which of the users is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data for the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns encouraging people to get off the couch and exercise for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
With regular exercise, the likelihood of developing cancer or depression is lower.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
Thus, it achieves three basics that support health —exercise, fresh air and sun, and joy.
It is even possible to make new friends during the hunt.
As usual, this phenomenon also includes disapproving pranksters.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is complete.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track your activity in the past, they didn't give you a reason to get going, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty disappears, and use decreases in time.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase physical activity for people going on a hunt and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles captures gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless on the boom.
Jaw-dropping perm.
Great at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The American 19-year-old gymnast won the multi-tasking championship on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His overall score of 62,198 was clearly better than silver-ranked "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the boom in the multi-match final of the women's gymnastics individual on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Party became the fourth consecutive and fifth ever American woman to win a multi-match championship, thus cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his final total points became visible and his long road to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to a whole new dimension and puts him in the same category as other superstars in the sport, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior in his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, and earning them with programs so ambitious and accurate that Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton of 1984 called him "the greatest rack gymnast of all time."
In Brazil, there was still one last race, which was fought primarily between Biles and himself and the burden of over-expectations, rather than between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas for less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman of the United States hug after winning gold and silver in the multi-match final of the Women's Stand Gymnastics Individual on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of the i for the farewell party of Martha Karolyi, who coordinated the national team and now retires.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program — which includes a series of volts known as his trump card — has been adapted to Latin music that might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
Boorman, who was adopted by his grandparents as a child and found by coach Aimee Boorman's mother, has become a powerful figure. Boorman found the girl while she was on a daycare excursion in the gymnasium where Boorman was coaching.
He has not lost a single multi-match race since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a small lead with two twists, it was like mirage.
What remained was a boom and a permanto, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained the lead with 15,433 points from the boom and crowned the final score with 15,933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him as they waited for the final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear around the glistening color of Biles's red, white, and blue eyeliner when the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a slight rematch for a four-year-old race when he first shared the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom Americans call the team's "grandmother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the audience after his permanto program, thus rising from a losing position to a winner, which at times seemed uncertain.
As for Partys, this tweet, made by a 19-year-old earlier in the week and widely circulated, now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three people who listened to music in the car were victims of a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's deadliest massacre in ten years, with victims sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, a police statement released Thursday.
According to authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on June 12.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped in another car.
Police suspect the triple murder was not the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the purses or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix Police spokesperson, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the killing was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks that have taken place in predominantly Hispanic-populated areas within four months.
"It's common for events to have occurred in residential areas outside homes," Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died instantly at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, police released a statement announcing the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered a bullet from the car seat and fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital microcephaly, due to a genetic disorder of his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, of which he was unaware when he was pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I'm not going to make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which isn't true at all — of course, you're committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and might not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing the child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there was such a practice anymore," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund sat up and didn't start crawling until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he is slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of the sign, by which he means "sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only refer to ordinary sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly can be caused by several different diseases: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
There is great variability in symptoms and prognosis.
It is still too early to assess how it will affect the lives of those affected by the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls an emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept going: What will happen to us,
What will happen to us."
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it."
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things are getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused large-scale rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, with more rains expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi overflow their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the floodplains.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the governor's office for national security and emergency preparedness, said the agency was receiving requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele says Tangipohoa County alone has requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in effect until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to a statement issued by the weather service, an additional 76 to 127 mm of water may be coming into the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile region.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are predicted to reach record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many of the houses along the rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as the flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already risen higher than ever at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue efforts continued in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
A nearby stepson had warned him.
"We got up, and there was water coming in with a constant pass," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
Rescue workers had rescued all three in a large army-style truck and taken them to a fire station in Gloster, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He reports information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil was heavily wet after the rains began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to heavy rains and flooding of the streets, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school classes had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangihopa city council had told WWL, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
County Director Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped by the flood.
The evacuated have been given shelters in the towns of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes once the water begins to retreat," he says.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to the flood, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from reaching their homes and business premises.
"The last time we experienced a major flood was in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the city board.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued to be steady along the Gulf Coast, says Rupert Lacy, Harrison County Rescue Director.
Lacy reports that there were reports of a handful of flooded houses on Thursday, but as of Friday, none had been reported.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has been living in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second 6-year-old to be shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to his grandparents, the boy had multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother, Delores Melendez, to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to be alive.
He was starting first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and the other two were in stable condition, CBS Philadelphia reports.
According to the television network, the child was found in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with assault-type shells originating from a variety of assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present, and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and it is reported that police are going through surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old victim of a shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by a stray bullet while she was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call the women's gymnastics Olympic team, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so overwhelming as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many girls of color.
The team's line-up, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas emerged as the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterful rack gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a multi-match women's individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but it doesn't look the same in gymnastics classes nationwide.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same trail as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as there will only be four gymnasts on the next rack gymnastics Olympic team, and this is Marta Karolyi's final year as coach.
However, the reality is that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private scaffolding gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by their parents. Parents have to pay for training costs, facilities, travel, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
The facilities of most scaffolding gymnastics clubs are located in affluent residential areas that are able to support the activity.
The teaching of gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it implies an expensive and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached athletes in the sport since they began their gymnastics.
We need to organize more affordable and accessible gymnastics classes for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm Simone, Gabby and Laurie have aroused.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have provided a free or affordable opportunity for gymnastics for more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand into my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality rack gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great sport of the Olympics.
Rack gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in the thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and it's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold medal, and for motivating so many young girls from so many different backgrounds to start their way to being healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by accepting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to force an agreement and said the UK's public health system (NHS) was "nobody's land" and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA's Junior Medical Committee, issued a statement last night saying: "Junior doctors are still very wary of the proposed agreement, with a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so we need to move forward now, because time is running out.
The BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant to engage in attempts at dialogue and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, reverse the implementation of the agreement and address the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be ready for further industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 appointments when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the striking doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers hoped to bring the dispute over the changes to an end by concluding a renewed agreement with staff members of the British trade union representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be affected by the agreement.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of the NHS, called on junior doctors not to go on strike again.
Mortimer says, "Industrial action achieves very little or nothing, but it puts pressure on teams and services that are already at the limit and causes concern, distress, and disruption to patients, medical staff, and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the junior medical committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the detection of grievances.
Employees were hopeful that continued positive engagement on other important topics — such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave, and gender pay gap in the care sector — was a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England, and the Department of Health want to stick to the agreements with the BMA in November, February, and May."
A drug costing $2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting access to a drug costing around $2.40 a day, as authorities recommended it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK's public health system (NHS), has advised that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK's public health system (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, with a quarter of those having a heart attack recur or having a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fatty substance that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels and produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if a blood clot breaks loose, it can travel with the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Tikagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, followed by a reduction to 60 milligrams, and additional aspirin twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, a professor at the Center for the Evaluation of the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE), says: "While there are effective treatment methods available to effectively prevent the progression of the disease and the emergence of symptoms, up to a quarter of those who suffer a heart attack will experience a new seizure or stroke — often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in terms of the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for any longer.
Due to the climate of political correctness, voter fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was sacked last year for corruption, resulting in a government report.
A climate of political correctness led to the closing of eyes to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report released today reveals.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former government minister, strongly criticized police, election observers and city councils for turning a blind eye to election fraud "because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
According to Pickles, a former regional government minister and current anti-corruption force figure, intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have had permission to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect the intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present identification in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter is only required to state their name and address.
In addition, the report suggests dipping fingers into indelible ink after voting so that no one could vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be protected more, says Sir Eric.
He calls for improved access to government documents and decisions by informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the East London Tower Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that then-Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office due to corruption and numerous unlawful practices.
The court held that Rahman "sneeredly" at the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use as a basis for his campaign that it was the religious duty of every Muslim who believed in him to vote for him."
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently cast by the person pretending to be someone else.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about postal election fraud, in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring identification at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, especially in communities with Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds."
"There was concern that...state institutions had turned a blind eye to such activities because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots by political activists in order to prevent the "harvest of votes".
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options that would require voters to present identification before voting.
Baptism of fingers on indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibiting political activists from handling filled votes and mail-voice envelopes.
Police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to prosecute for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act of 1983.
Banning photography at polling stations.
Allowing only English at polling stations (except Wales).
More effective training to ensure that staff enforce the rule that only one person may enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric severely criticizes the London police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representatives from their duties because of corruption and numerous unlawful practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized ineffective "tick checks" by the city council's electoral rolls departments.
"The court's decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert election fraud and its denial by some quarters."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers fascinate at Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is astonishing.
But according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. men's archery team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine's doppelganger seen on cycling tracks, many people have noted in social media how one archer could be the twin brother of actor-favorite Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison of the U.S. men's archery team caused a storm after pictures of him posted on Twitter, in which he strikingly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that he had heard from childhood that he resembled DiCaprio.
"I personally don't see the resemblance as great, except perhaps for the beard and mustache," said Brady Huffington to the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
The 2012 London Games featured a similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which will no doubt be highlighted even more in these races.
The big-eyed and expressive Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh, on the other hand, has been compared to Matthew Morrison from the Glee television series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is the "athletic version" of the actor in the film Inception.
Similarly, a similarity between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, highlighted by their powerful eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver medalist, Russian Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not only because of her beautifully tanned skin and blonde hair, while Nathan Adrian of the United States team is, according to his fans, an "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
The two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the resemblance as well.
This user wonders if there is a good reason for the resemblance of the couple.
One tweeter recently expressed his joy when "others on the internet agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series truly reminiscent of each other in their face shapes and eyes.
Many have also noticed a resemblance in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney, and the wide smiles of gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna on Fire! star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes After Saying Chinese Swimmer 'Dead Like a Pig'
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish in the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay stunned viewers of the CBC live Olympic report on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smelling" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to voice his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 metre freestyle relay finale.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
He was too excited, left in a hurry, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the message at 1:57.79, and missed 1.61 seconds of Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
Chinese Ai Yanhan, who swam in the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle relay final, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled up with ferocious Byron MacDonald critical comments, and many called for his dismissal.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist bunch. #disgusting."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly apologized for MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment made about the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator fellow Scott Russel had to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and glued its regrets to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly issued a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they made it to the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air last night, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized on the air and tried to justify his speech by saying he didn't mean it was personal.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay swim," MacDonald said on the CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I didn't mean anything derogatory with my words, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, a woman who tried on underwear in the middle of the store shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark to try on her underpants.
He further exacerbated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underpants, taking them off the leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to wander around and eventually tried four pairs of underpants at a shop at Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
A Primark chain store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried on underwear in front of everyone and put it back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, says that after trying on underwear, an unknown woman dressed up and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He recounts what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear and put them on.
He did not try to do it inconspicuously, but did it without any shame.
Everyone stared at him as he took off his tried underpants and apparently didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like any of them, dressed up and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks — and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he'd been wearing."
33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent town, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff tried to remove those pieces of clothing from the sale after the woman had left — which is correct.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them out without having washed them afterwards," adds Davidson.
A Primark spokesperson commented, "Primark is aware of the situation at its Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
Here's how to defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser waving a gun at close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against an attacker depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker is approaching from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon so that it is caught between your forearm and upper arm, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with the knee into the groin, and as he goes out of pain twice, slap him in the face with the barrel of the gun and retreat by holding the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You need to move away from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grasp, back off and keep the gun aimed at the attacker.
Does that sound awkward?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Keep in mind, however, that the safest way to get rid of a robber is to hand over your cash — unless you are a Krav Maga Grand Master.
Ian Wright, a travel guide-making world traveler, licks some of Europe's dirtiest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and gag reflexes to the test by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most repulsive places.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk-based presenter and author of travel guides, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking euro banknotes, hand railings in Piccadilly Circus, the flush button on the train's toilet, and a Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the subjects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film, Ian Wright — On the Trace of Inner Power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet flush button on a train can be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a foul mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, in which he tested his gut endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Licking the railings at the railway stations and the flush button on the toilet undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "I've been pretty carefree about my health since I was a kid, and I've put all kinds of stuff in my mouth, like dirt, worms, and mud water."
In the film, he really showed himself to be as good as his reputation.
The border only met in the filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
By comparison, in newly washed hands, the number is usually less than 60.
The border met in a Russian public restroom, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units — in freshly washed hands, the same number is less than 60.
In the documentary Ian Wright, produced together with Valio, Wright adventures on the trail of Inner Power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in various places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright - On the Track of Inner Power in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Wright received Valio Gefillus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut's good bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, category manager for Valio snack, juice and new products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and eventually we came to the idea of asking Ia to come along."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The film is also about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, licking some items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of the respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with stomach and intestinal well-being, and 58% said that they at least occasionally used products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A city-owned tenement house in Saltash, Cornwall, was destroyed before being evicted by a dysfunctional family.
The disrupter family left £50,000 of damage behind in a city-owned tenement house after they were evicted due to neighborhood terrorization.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their Cornwall apartment in Saltash after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company stated that the apartment was in repair condition when they were shocked.
There were gaping openings in the walls, floorboards had been torn off, debris had been spread on the floors, and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The couple have now moved and are believed to be living in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears the apartment may no longer be salvageable.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh, as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to police, the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use and transmission, and loud shouting, arguing, and swearing.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an anti-social behavior order in June.
In several rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old waste was found.
Drugs had previously been sold in the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and the police had to be called regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Office forcibly evicted the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anybody.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
The police have been here an incredible number of times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It's going to be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of enforcement for the Cornwall Housing Authority, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were called on a regular basis.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the tenement house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Authority is considering.
This incident was extremely difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the community members who participated in the work and bravely offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated."
Fitzpatrick reports that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Housing workers now have to clean out the piles of waste surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug in an attempt to sell it.
He claimed the money was for the headstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and her husband have been heard to have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction of tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police says this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave the way they want without being charged, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
A low-flying, beach-bound military jet scared off tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed at a staggeringly low altitude.
The Air Force said it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show an army aircraft coming almost within touch of sunbathing tourists on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers got on their feet, understandably concerned about the roar of the jet engines, which began to be heard before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the holidaymakers who filmed the dramatic flyby and posted the videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice at really low altitude, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were shocked when a plane suddenly came into view and flew at a staggering low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the fishing vessels on the coast, which is why the plane had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke from nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have devastated parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility caused by dense fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Eksote's first half-year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote's profit showed a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where it has been possible to dismantle institutional care by developing preventive services.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for measures.
The exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining portion of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers sworn in at Immola
The Border and Coast Guard School's 70 conscripts took the military oath on Friday.
A military swear-in ceremony for the Border and Coast Guard school conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Jaeger Course ceremony was held on the garrison's sports field.
Seventy conscripts took the military oath.
Special Rangers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become special border guards.
250 of them were invited to take the selection exams.
Special Rangers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime frontier forces were present at the Veterans' Meeting held in connection with the oath ceremony.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A circle ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has operated an RTA, or Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Chief of Staff is the Chief Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in plainclothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers in Häme.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would rarely leave until they received an alarm.
With the help of the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal intelligence centre, its three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were established in each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the National Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, manages operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Enquiry extends beyond your area
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the entire police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an alert task database and observations to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, prolific criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint can also be seen in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, a certain image is formed of the perpetrator.
Serialization can be done based on either the method of the act or the person, depending on which one the police have more information about.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of their own methods as well as those used by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent attempts by the police to prevent crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which vacant dwellings were marked in early summer, used in house burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, pin, or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties involved.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest people order the district court's minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the National Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
Against the background of a decrease in the volume of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new course of action were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation is used to collect information from outside one's own institution and Finland's borders.
ISIS-affiliated London schoolgirl killed in Syria
News reports that one of three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed by Russian airstrikes on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, was just planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and testament for people to understand that this is a real risk when entering a war zone - and one that will cause people to give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other schoolgirls from East London, boarded a plane to Turkey and took a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court justice if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have refused to confirm Garland's nomination since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would choose the person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will choose Garland with "pretty much confidence."
Reid's spokesperson later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether she intended to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are Donald Trump's "commanders" and "adjutant."
He says Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong to women as well as men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to bring to market a calendar for 2017 made in the style of the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, said earlier this year that his magazine, which seeps at nudity, is different from old-school Playboy magazines, as he said: "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We need to bring back the timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, can undisturbed enjoy and be inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release.
"Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful piece of art."
Those who want to model for the calendar can submit their photos online or attend open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The charm of vinyl: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write your angry objection to the comment section under the pseudonym EivaAll Lonely Middle-Aged Men, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov research company, behind the re-emergence of much-spoken vinyl records is not the boom of the millennial generation, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is mid-life nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of enthusiasts to collect records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the bustling Soho Street, wearing a plain grey jacket. I would gesture busily, bend my hand to a cup, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over pre-owned facilities by private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the cameraman to stop the camera for a moment as I search very close to the men visiting these shops and try to assess their age and temperament by observing.
Stuart, 55, of Glasgow, who I follow from the Sister Ray movement (customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (customers at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably in her twenties) are on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spend extra time exploring the supply of stores.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 30,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the photo. (Stuart emailed me the picture, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to re-buy things that he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff in the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to have them," she says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy being around themselves, adding, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink very much.
That's my bad."
Wez, 25, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of influx of people affected by media hype, who have heard of vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"Based on the conversations I had had, people had generally given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This may explain the boom of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the recordings?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset with the contactless payment system.
The digital world may baffle some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record cases means permanence and reminds of the happy days of youth.
"I think sometimes it fills a gap or material possessions are acquired for some kind of consolation," says Wez.
"I see it as a collector myself, and I believe so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things."
"We're like social workers!" shouts Wez's co-worker from behind the stack of records.
An April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought the vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to the album.
An opinion poll also reported that 41 percent have a record player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl record buyers don't have a record player of their own at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while scrolling through a stack of bossa nova collections.
The re-emergence of vinyl records is also associated with the " trophy phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, the seller of the Sounds of the Universe movement (currently three middle-aged men as customers).
"A customer recently came into the store and said he doesn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The percentage of such customers is not high, but they do exist.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers, who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is considerably more varied in Foppi, where I will be arriving next. The store has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl records.
Clients include couples in their seventies, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys, and middle-aged women.
The diversity of the customers is gratifying, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: instead of rocking jazz from the speakers, Wild Beasts' newest synthesizer pop that seeps at sex.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and watching various albums on sale.
He's more of a watcher than a shopper.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
The music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the finer point of the wine is ...", he lets off a fond sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a group of teenage girls who would imagine jumping around in jeans shorts, but instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and a daughter thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase with a wall filled with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, central records to any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some so high that they can't even be reached.
They are pure "art vinyl" interiors.
But given that all the ways to get attention to these records might mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little cause for complaint.
It is no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most also has the group that spends the most money on luxuries, such as vinyl records.
While my research shows that YouGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or in working life.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old television presenter who stares frighteningly and glances at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest-living vertebrate — video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was found to be between 272 and 112 years old in the study.
French court rejects application for demolition of jungle camp shops
A French court has rejected an application by the Calais authorities calling for the demolition of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp populated by thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais officials made claims that the state should have permission to break up the 72 temporary stores set up in the refugee camp. The stores sell various goods from tobacco to energy drinks and offer haircuts to the residents of the refugee camp. In the temporary restaurants, you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to the Calais Prefect Authorities, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential to the camp, as free meals provided by a government-sponsored organization and others are not enough for the camp's growing population.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling 72 temporary traders, but found the concerns of the Calais Prefect "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp's grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants are of far greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they provide peaceful places for refugees and volunteers to meet each other.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids café, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice to the camp's hundreds of unaccompanied minors, whose status is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the children's café be preserved.
According to the letter to the Guardian, closing it "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has reached a record high of over 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while its price fell by 0.9 per cent on average in EU countries.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
In the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen second most in those EU countries with wages similar to those in Finland.
Of the comparison countries, only in the UK has food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data appear in an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is being weighed down by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Tighter price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with wages similar to those of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven per cent in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level in the EU countries and the price competition must continue," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
A person returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan states the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
For example, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are already starting in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how schooling is made more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as the ice shark, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It could live another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507.
The Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to monitoring only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks from the 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimetre Amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are over four metres tall, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 - sellers will not be reduced
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
The co-operation companies in the troubled company ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of vendors of department stores will not be reduced, so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, about 80 support function employees are offered a new job as a salesperson.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations affected approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the reduction need was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to materialise next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann's acting CEO, sales in department stores have not met the targets set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen says in a press release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was particularly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter revenue and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group had an operating profit of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees all over the country
The low-pressure centre on top of the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but further south there will be poutine.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, it remains between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenya's Athletics Team Is Shaken by Doping Scandal - Strange Explanation for Coach's Rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete on a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform was 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials came to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, thundered news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner will be aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year on the way and is one of Rio's winning favourites in advance.
According to Reuters, a source inside Kenya's athletic team claimed that Anzrah was traveling on an athlete's accreditation card only to receive free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletic Stadium empties its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
A battle for athletics medals was started in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to the bafflingly empty stands.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day's morning games and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening games have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium bulged with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil's medal hopefuls Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, with 12,000 spectators only filling about 30 percent.
The poor performance is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, said that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, a figure clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over one thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to school children in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
People in the gallery were enough.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private individuals, businesses, and corporations can use the money to claim rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder gets the right to veto his 187-square-foot block, which basically means that approval is not required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring a right of possession is something tangible that can be left as a legacy or gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself up somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
A person who has acquired the right of possession will receive accurate location information from their block, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of those who have acquired the rights are displayed on the same map where the parcel information for the land can be found.
Leviäkangas sees the risk of its nature conservation acquisition only as the foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow operate unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It mainly finances its operations through the sale of rights to bearers, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in a pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst hitters of major cities in Turku - see the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves are the ones who torment Turku the most from Finland's big cities.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the reported thefts of bicycles by police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and their parts per 1,000 inhabitants stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were between four and five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are double the number of thefts per capita compared to others," says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the National Police Board.
The police in Turku wonder why the city is at the top of the ranking.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much people move around the city on bikes and how many bikes there are at all," ponders Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the top spot in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a compact centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transportation," Reen says.
In Finland as a whole, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have been reported by the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police become aware of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"Those are big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report theft of a bicycle, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police survive.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are informed immediately of the theft and the thief is caught in the act.
"Cases are also found in connection with other investigations when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in an apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from the bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars of shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual bike models, Jopoja is the most stolen, as in previous years.
A U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but much of the stolen bikes end up being sold, for example, online.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that there's a lot of stolen bikes going abroad," Reen says.
According to police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may commit a concealment crime or offence.
"The alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colourful Nopsa always to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He's had five bikes, but none have been stolen, says Moose. "Never been taken, so far has been a good monk."
"Perhaps this doesn't so much attract thieves, this doesn't necessarily have a hipster value either," Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to visit a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike slumped against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student in Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from the guys that the bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such snotty Jopos."
A bicycle was stolen from Valve from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
However, the bike had remained unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be usurped.
Children under 15 to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to try out peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a vicious circle of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15, who will now be left without criminal responsibility.
A peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is for the peer jury to discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
"Everybody steers the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after their first crime, does not get in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with someone about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Service designer Iikka Lovio from Palmu, the service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes committed by persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want Party to Stop Funding Trump Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is aimed at Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be diverted to Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, along with his disregard, incompetence and record unpopularity, threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy is doing well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so the economy will do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American laborers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he emphasized that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As president, I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "favouring only millionaires like this one."
Trump's proposed cut in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called "Trump a loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner herself.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
Here are the Rio ratings: The Games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewing statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: Tuesday evening swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago drew almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
So far, the most interested Olympic sports have been Sunday night cycling and the rack gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the Games, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Yle sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that spectators will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics is the first sports event for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes in 24 hours a day, and there are from 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all that time, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the mellow interest - if you consider it a mellow one - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial ratings have been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics starts, ratings go up.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already about 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get online ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics can be seen on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe relays races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious Yle has ever seen, but also the last that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports can be seen on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres on Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square metres on Ristiselkä, the depth of which the dive computer looked like 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar extraction.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, Päijänne does not get to the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected the last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax cuts: Pensioners' taxation still more strained
Pensioners' taxation is still more strained than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievances came up before the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income deductions that eased taxation.
The matter heated up opposition representatives in the parliament, who grilled the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubb (college) about the election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (College) on tax cuts is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (centre) and Orpo's messages about the desire to honour the hard-won Competitiveness Pact.
He says sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It comes in need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Dealing with long-term unemployment in the throes
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will elude.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No known Finnish casualties in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular for information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No knowledge of the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador thinks the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, on the other hand, there is an ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police say.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the space of 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourists' favourites Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in the night on holiday island Phuket, a tourist destination popular with Finns, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, yesterday and today, according to local officials.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta that dominates Thailand, says the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite more people to panic," he told reporters.
Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the deputy prime minister in charge of security, said at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to go to Thailand to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Grand Mission for caution, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
Very little is known so far about the attacks and their victims that took place during the Finnish night.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's latter attack.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found yet another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal worker was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Thani, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's quadruple
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60.098 points and Russian Aliya Mustafina was third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for rack championships at the Rio Games in perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics as much as he can over the last few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanto championships three times in a row, as well as a boom last year and the year before.
The U.S. team at Biles has won two team competition world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals at the party have jumps and booms.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think anything more miraculous will follow, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have been experienced in Thailand from close quarters.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was the bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't expelled the tourists, then probably this one hasn't either.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said it was not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three in the day on Patong, traffic had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the impact, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later that car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby spruce.
Another man was immediately caught.
Another escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear set aside
On Friday, Russia made the highest-ranking leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin sacked Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino from Estonia.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from amassing too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating independent power for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten into trouble with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take on special duties in the fields of environment and transport.
In a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be reassigned and proposed the persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's seat is that Putin changes his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but it is based on the law.
Earlier, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants for the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Director of Communications says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform the practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time.
He injured his back thigh in the early part of the season and was forced to miss the Jamaican Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's the key thing," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included underdressed samba dancers and journalists turned fans.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred meters, with which he smashed the world record and the contestants' confidence in spite of the final celebration, with a time of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career measured by a bell.
The world records of 9.58 in the 100 metres and 19.19 in the 200 metres, set in Berlin, are still valid today.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second undershoot, but no one but Bolt believes it will happen.
On the 100, Bolt's toughest contender is Athens 2004's 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single title in the finals, if he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the 100th World Cup final due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as his final finish line.
These are the Olympic Games that set me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping test found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspected doping cases have also been reported in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio because of an anti-doping attack.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Phelps won't be stopped by anything - historical gold came in show style
Michael Phelps of the United States, the most successful athlete in Olympic history, swam in the 200-meter mixed season for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the same sport's Olympic gold medal in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second in the mixed season before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have some fun," Helen Skelton, the BBC's Olympic swimming commentator, laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) made on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little bit of noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is certainly at least revealing enough - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
There are no back steps, however.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure to want to shock and perhaps even startle, but he insists he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
You're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the noise reaching all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big of a sacrifice they make is okay for me," Skelton grinned.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from (the host's) dress.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests for suspected terror attack
Rio police announced on Thursday that they have arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the safety monitoring of the games.
At the same time, police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police back in July.
The detainees are believed to be linked to ISIS.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages urging violence had been circulated, among others, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blast suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-half Rio basketball tournament match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police allowed the crowd in after they had controlledly blown up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was able to enter after police had controlledly blown up the package.
The crowd did not make it to the stands by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only allowed the public into the hangar afterwards.
The drink awakened the Spanish team, which started the games drowsily.
Spain, which started with two losses, beat Nigeria by 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
Police conducted a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious find was near a road cycling finish site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their early stages of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dame poked Petäjä-Siren - Finnish man ponders protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a rough patch on Thursday.
The Argentinean dame pounced on Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio for the opening start of Women's Surfing Day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete thought for a long time about the protest.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water in order to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finn was 27 when he left the crash.
Overall, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
In terms of the tip, the crash had little effect.
Friday is an important day when there is a race starts 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says will lengthen your life
Science has studied everything possible between heaven and earth.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is extended.
On the other hand, things that a person himself cannot control can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to middle-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't even have to splurge - just picking up a milk carton is enough.
The secret of longevity has been tried with many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest results of the study.
According to science, all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death," especially for neurological or cardiac diseases.
Studies in favor of alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, in turn, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway examined how laughter affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
On top of that, it can also extend your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in their life, they must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings extra years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute solitude.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether an Olympic medal-winning athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that longevity, on the other hand, is due to a person's social status - which, on the other hand, makes it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 found that a person who shopped daily was likely to live less often than a parent who shopped.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring earlier death.
So put the credit card out of your hand - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
Drunk driver derails into truck
On Friday evening, a serious frontal collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskentie, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when a passenger car that had been encountered had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left standing in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car swerved into the ditch and from there over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The rescue service removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mille.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Mail sent loose candy to the wrong town
There were shortcomings in the K-Citymarket's bulk candy selection because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candies at Salo K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught her eye.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk sweets because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
Unless there was a traffic jam on the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant's foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The cutting of grass is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
I was blown away by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention given to this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to catch her own favorites in a loose candy bag, even though a few cases were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti's Transport Services business, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do part-delivery (Saloon) with three, but only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all of her favourites in the selection.

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project already in 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and has gradually lost 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of her soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has garnered a number of complimentary comments from fellow dieters.
You're great.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one exclaims.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I myself am on the same journey, another says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to normal weight, which was ten kilos away at the time.
Over the course of three months of fitness, the pounds eventually dropped by five.
The Wish of the Family of a Murdered Woman in Loviisa: Remembrance of the Victim for Police Dogs
A week ago, a family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation instead of flowers and petition for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update states that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise a leased employee, estimates the Kanta-Häme District Court in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and €2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the ruling, Posti could have withheld only a part of the induction worker's salary that corresponded to the part of the induction worker's work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage, in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act, on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Union of Postal and Logistics Union PAU's organizational decision on the introduction ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees will not familiarise themselves with temporary agency workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights-respecting path
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Federation of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to the attention of Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin fired the head of his administration - replaced by Persecution of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, the head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin says.
He will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonia's Communist leader Karl Vaino.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's tight-knit inner circle, will, according to the Kremlin's press release, take on special duties in the fields of environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be reassigned and proposed to replace Persecution, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era on KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his position in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition ban - not to be seen in Premier League opening
The world record holder for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with England.
Manchester United's acquisition of Paul Pogba is sidelined by the ban as ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Italian club Juventus €105 million for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was placed under a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and will be banned from one game.
That ban has been moved to England," the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In flow, megalomaniacism is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festivalgoers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival's event area is stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind success is simple: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in event productions to think this way.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 last year.
This year, too, the festival will feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to finance things in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered in huge lanes.
We don't want that.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated to include 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year the venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company that runs Flow was approximately six million euros.
It can also be used to produce "creative things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit in with Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done damn good shows in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowerpots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured in the attack.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a telling picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said that a bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the Finnish island of Phuket.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another twin bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials said there were likely rebel forces behind the bombings, who were not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken a keen interest in the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness force goes into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not assigned to combat missions until several months after taking a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Chief of Defence Training, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable, for example, from conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the head of training, the first order of duty is the reservists who are part of the readiness force.
No conscript or reservist is assigned to a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will begin training conscripts for the immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola Receives Giant Reimbursement for Homestead
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so a financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple's court and settlement costs for a total of 47,344 euros.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when the apartment sale was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction errors that had occurred were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court of appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm from the items mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and drawbacks of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and meltwater running down the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was a matter of any urgency.
Tola and Waroma remained under the impression that rainwater from the cliffs should perhaps be controlled a little over the next few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, was caused by both the rainwaters in the rock and the soil moisture rising capillary.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated with microbes could also enter the interior through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mold or yeast that allows health risk and exceeds the limit values was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also debated whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes to the apartment had been made in violation of the permit prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its ruling.
Creepy archive find: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - register also Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives of Maryland in the United States has recorded documents on microfilm involving a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch, and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the racial office in Nazi Germany.
The Bureau of Race operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological examinations were performed on the women to find out.
The Bureau of Race examined women's backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones to the Bureau of Race.
The Race Bureau wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving", "austere", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the standards were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and supported having children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honour was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of Petäjä-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the sailing Finnjollie day at the Rio Olympics, but was the tail of the whole group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X class day starts at number 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded on a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland's favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää continues to buff and is currently in a frenzied uproar.
A book written by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Palajana, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career, both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total rush when he won the crown of tango king at the Tango Market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed some different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted in a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hungover!
Bridgehead reminisces in the book.
From the recording of the song, which has become a huge hit, one would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, it was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top notch all the time.
Another incident involving one of the man's most popular songs, as described in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with her partner at the time and the case eventually ended up in the texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the song lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, it was written based on a 7-day news story.
The newspaper reported that the reason for the breakup between Jari and his ex-lover was due to Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and was not true.
Jari, according to the book, played furiously for the label and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters supported the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls for the voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of remaining in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the distinction, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into a slump in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics outlines responses from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand the economy.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off to the real Britain.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists did not come up enough.
They were particularly annoyed by the BBC's neutrality, which gave as much space to pro-EU economists representing only a couple of per cent of the economists as it did to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling us what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letter combinations about the consequences of the separation are.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored because the economists represent an elite with whom, in their opinion, the voters have no common interests.
Economists such as big city academics would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, Immigrants crowd your hospital, Immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
The waiting room of every health center sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get doctor's appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond to them and if they did, their responses did not gain prominence.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health center queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, preparations for Brexit were made in time in Aberdeen by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of a camp in favour of leaving the EU, began to be prepared for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have substantial liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went on to grow cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily quoted real estate fund that was affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds fell to ten percent or even less.
In other words, real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds Closed Trade
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together blundered the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the store, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the notice.
Since then it has been fairly flat, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental European funds, for example.
However, there were a lot of queries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen's opinion, the closures of real estate funds received undue attention.
Open funds, which were affected by the closures, control about 4% of British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may be holding its funds until the end of 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been raved down, but the situation does not look more "crazy" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar collector can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings downs on London's real estate market
At 2 a.m., things didn't look too bad.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's where the word of strength came from.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the early hours of the morning.
The TV screens, normally set silent at the office, were pounding the news, and the usually loud crowds were completely silenced to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote, or midsummer.
The mood was mixed.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote starts correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went for an exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the real estate market in Britain, and London in particular.
London's office space was predicted to have up to 20% downsides in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear, however, in Vanhanen's face that he spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is still too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the breakup will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
CBRE, a real estate services company, provides about one-third of the market with information on price developments.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, the minus amounted to 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're month-to-month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have only been worse figures in the past five months, Vanhanen says.
All equal falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared to Lehman's downfall and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite accurate, as this is a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those times, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding can also be found normally.
The repair could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think the price-fixing movement is a miracle - it could have been there without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, real estate prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have skyrocketed for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
The British economy has grown strongly, with London's population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for income in new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis, according to Vanhanen.
Decentralize, Decentralize
Prices in London stabilized last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to ease its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of reversal to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any uptick in the way.
The mood indicates that there is a falling or even going on ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the retail group announced today that it will start collecting more accurate information about its regular customers' purchases.
Once data has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it in early May for the purchased products as well.
S Group is following Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing on a licensed basis.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in S Group's registration.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is currently planned.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own loyalty program Ykkösbonus, which can be joined in Valintatalo, Siwa and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product- or product-level data, we stay at the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day, as well as the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as K Group or S Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially an experiment
SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive until now.
In addition to personal data and address information, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, as well as children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment have been recorded for the S-Front Card purchase.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, data in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, there have been hopes from customers that marketing could be targeted more accurately, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in cashiers anyway, whether you like it or not.
A willing person can check their stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - puppy becomes first explosive dog
A black Labrador retriever puppy sniffs energetically five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favorite toy.
The box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of shells that smelled of gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures at Customs, and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Senior Inspector Mikko Grönberg from Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosives dog for Customs' duties are mail shipments through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport each year, among which may be weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 finds related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Finnish Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila at the experts of the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders get to Heila from a one-time cap.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the cover of the camera mic to the fast dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy immediately on the "loose" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active portions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a strong competition for working dogs in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
Mini nation gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
The Olympic gold medal in rugby in Fiji, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheer," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded on his last attempt from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening quality as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kg for the push and 145 kg for the stunt.
His total was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his thrust in the last 175 kg, as did his other.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with a fierce roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men's football league, has made a long-term contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team, who has power and has a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, where he scored 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goalie Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Defiant Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become well-known as Alex Dunphy in the Modern Family comedy series, once again flaunts her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has posed on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scantily dressed.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently released several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television most of his life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood," Palmer says to Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downswing is already so hard," a woman on Winter's Instagram says.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You're an inspiration to many women," exclaims the young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured by the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their aurora trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations for Japanese auroral tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season begins early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would miss clearer unique sights in Finland, and here the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 after Fiji's champion team won gold
Great Britain's impressive success in the seven-player rugby competition was dashed when Fiji won it in the final at Rio's Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, 43-3.
Fiji taught the champions in ball handling, transfers, side diversions, support play, running lines, and brute force, thus winning gold — if it was the country's first Olympic medal in all of its history.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly bigger consolation for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first-ever rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A tight win from the South African Boxes by 7-10 in the semi-finals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-man team had been in full force.
It may be a comfort to the UK that at least one Briton will receive a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, a former England rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It has been quite an experience for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan's coaching.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
Loss hurts, but progress is startling.
Fiji got off to an excellent start and showed off their tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had collided with a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a dive into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored the second goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented a massive Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow down Fiji for long.
After seven minutes of play, Jasa Veremalua scored a goal in the right corner, after which Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal from the re-start, leaving more than a minute left in the first half of the game.
Subsequently, Vatemo Ravouvou crashed through the UK team's increasingly powerless tackles and crashed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of apprentice in the sport.
Which is largely true.
Great Britain made large-scale changes at halftime and managed to hold off the Fijians for a full four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored thanks to the excellent team play of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the score to 36-1 by scoring for Great Britain in the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Seas archipelagoers, whose fans in the stands sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fiji's pure joyous attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final touch on the Fijian cake by scoring in the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had beaten Japan in the semi-finals by 20-30 and Great Britain had crept past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was settled by the Great Britain goal kick.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and swooped under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer spurred Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row for gold
This is the most emotional gold could be in these games.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 winning bets into history and found extra purpose for their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two oarsmen, the third voice in the boat echoed coach Robin Williams, who spurred them on to their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's duo. This makes them the first women in the history of British sports to achieve a similar feat.
Their superiority was undisputed, winning for them already 39th in a row and once again a record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes sprawling on the water surface like swans to age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind every rowing gold there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the duo's achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know then if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way you think a little bit."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that Williams was able to begin his treatment outside of the high season in early 2014, when the suspension caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say so in circumstances like this.
"I needed the money, so I had to heal quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the win, the two's thoughts were with Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says, "Emotionally I've been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's checkout has been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the past five years.
The two have found a superior rhythm that their rivals have failed to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish duo began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very caught up in an instant.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the trail."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we weren't trying to do anything wonderful.
We didn't reach for the skies today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race, which we did."
The two think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates her wedding next month with Steve Backshall, a friend of TV's nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would have put too much pressure on me."
"After London, it took me about six months to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
It feels so much better," he says.
Iceland to replace Panama-leaked government
Iceland is holding an early parliamentary election in October, which protesters enraged by the Panama leaks are calling for as early as spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the outcome of the autumn election.
In the June presidential election, criticism of those in power was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recanted his latest rant.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that incumbent President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in its creation.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be Commander-in-Chief of the Army who can sink that low," Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned wearing Muslim-favored covert burkini swimwear on beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are highly suggestive of religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disorderly conduct in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two extremists linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the Oulu region's bathing waters passed the sieve - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-algae opacity has been observed in Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, Oulu Region Environmental Services took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits set by the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the Meriniemi bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae clouding observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet render the water unwieldy, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae bloom, creating blue-green algae mass as rafts on the water surface.
The environmental action will monitor the situation by means of more frequent inspections.
If blue-algae blooms become blue-algae blooms, this will also be announced separately on the bathing area notice board.

MTK's Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on a generational change of forest space.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational renewals of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income from forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational renewals of forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests at the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax amendment proposal.
Forest gift reduction is proposed to be done from the forest owner's pure capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry assumes that by making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry, the loss of the capital income of forestry would be prevented on the basis of it, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive the tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the yield value of the forest is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high, according to Hakkarainen.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner base, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the boundary ensures the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been carried out in forest policy for decades.
It is based on the aging of the forest owner base.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists on the Himanga - two cars swerved into a ditch and crashed into each other
There was a special chase in the Himanga of Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that drove in a row went into a ditch, after which the one in the rear crashed into the one that drove in front.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the on-call firemaster, the derailment in the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hailstorm.
There were two people in the back car, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometres to the River Kalajoki.
Finnish research may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of drug treatments for cancer by focusing on not only cancer cells, but also the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue.
The research results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home murder threshing continues at court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for second perpetrator as well
The threshing of the Muhos family home killing continues at the court for both convicts.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the family home killing in Muhos.
The other received 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of seriously endangering traffic safety as a young person and transporting a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs, and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has received a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the district court, the 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as a child protection unit director at a school in July last year.
The 17-year-old, convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young person to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a state of mind study, both of the convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to escape from the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, increasing only at 156 years of age
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the holker can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The lifespan of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows by only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive ice sharks.
Scientists discovered the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear testing in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although a throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a financial sage - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
As much as a third of the state's total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's push for a change in corporate tax were implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with tax breaks benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A truly staggering sum of $1,000 billion a year would be left uncollected.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's proposed discount of 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulating business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The decided environmental standards of haste must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must appoint "experts rather than bureaucrats".
"Destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems, according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax of 35%.
We offer a new future.
"Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his manners, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists -- including those close to Republicans -- see Trump's program take the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
A surge from the past - People's News
The sea is tumbling fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes amidst Madrid's street hustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a bit of a fun and turbulent satirical comedy, the pre-Skin where I live (2011) among the best of the Spanish squire's career.
On a level, Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama centered on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen largely as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on track for a middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed right up to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before the daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, also stars in the second female lead, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between the Stitches (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a lump, but I'd say with a bit of a twist and a bit of a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance in Julieta to the flashiness that is often so characteristic of Almodóvar films, down to the humor.
It is an evenly acted, restrained, place in places with good music and quite melancholy film with elements of elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there, and in such a way that it starts to stick in the eye more as a pure technicality than as a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, death, or otherwise only by sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the title character, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, or the tunings of the scene, does not improve particularly from this.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a bit lifeless.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three short stories by Nobel Prize-winning Canadian author Alice Munro.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Narratives.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably stronger drama, that much of the big stuff - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the movie deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premiere is 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers keep saying, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made by a raft of cuts.
There will be no further cuts.
The already decided savings of four billion will be enough.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) under the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
Education cuts continue.
The municipals are haunted
Why are the ministers so keen to stress the fact that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, Gallupit reports that the party of the government of Finland expects a ruckus defeat, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new councillors, much of whom will realise the price of influencing in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the three governments of roughly equal parties rests on the fact that the Finns Party can stand.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party already had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermenting state have also surfaced.
There will be no new cuts -rhetoric, firstly, to obscure the fact that next year they will be made violently and secondly to try to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set a target of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take on EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: indebtedness does not fold and does not even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means even tougher cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections will take over what is to come.
With these measures, the indebtedness will not be reversed
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not fold, even if Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The graphs presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it beyond question:
Forecasts of global economic growth have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, meaning that there will be no pull from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has barely risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except during the stimulus policy that was implemented temporarily at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the graphs presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
The debt stimulus proposed by the Left Alliance in spring 2015 was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, maintaining unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: Wanting to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four feel that organising day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also places responsibility on individual municipalities for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, the province is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the tasks that are the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
An underage drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie at half past one on Friday night.
A police patrol attempted to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man set out to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanranta Road, from where to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as an aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch in Kulvijärvi on Kaavintie at 9.15 p.m. on Thursday evening.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a curved turn to the left and had fallen into a ditch on its side.
Rescue services lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the overhead door, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
A fallen truck spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue services.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are searching for a woman, about 5'2" tall, slender and well-groomed, with white hair under her chin.
Observations and hints of the missing person's movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre's hotline number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The downdraft that knocked down the tents at the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the marketplace at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program will be organized as planned.
A surge flow occurs in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight initiate a descending airflow.
Changes in the water state of the thundercloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its rate towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
The path of the surge currents is difficult to predict.
The surge hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell to the ground, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported with a slight injury for further treatment.
Air Pollution Aging Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzed London's air's most toxic fine particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirees in London is two and a half years older than, say, a peer living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that comes from traffic fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who commute on foot near congested streets.
Londoners may try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed - pushed the man in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain further, as it collided with the rocks in front.
Riento with new powers for the upcoming season
Joensuulainen Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will go into the series starting in October from a better starting point than in memory.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tone is definitely better found than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as head coach of Rienno, praises the new team as entrepreneurial and cohesive.
From the foreign trio, Fred Musoni begins his second season at Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-centimeter wood chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Cups since 2003.
Now Tampere is in its sixth race, only 2013 missed out on Canada being better at North American qualifiers.
I was in Turku working and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was establishing a national floorball team.
I got interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the SM level as a floor bandy.
Sähly was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in 1991-92 with the university, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminated in silver 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM-series, the balance amounted to 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
The Joensuu based floorball club Josba was raised by Perttu Puska and the uncle-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, the attacking 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men's national games before this, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh pain and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran of the Seinäjoki brothers, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Championship last December.
The head coach of the Finnish Floorball Team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleybender Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after this season.
The Finnish Beach volleyball championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals will be played in both adult and adolescent leagues.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the top six pairs in each league's ranking will be qualified for the final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was raised by Elimäen YMCA and has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Now living in Helsinki, Hasu is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend the weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the baseball stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
Childhood has a lot of memories in mind.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old in the E-girls of the Elimäen YMCA.
At the top of the head is an oversized jersey, knee pads revolving around the ankles, and huge aces and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment that was comfortable to play in.
All the families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the club's president for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball as a counterweight during his junior years.
The swimming pool has been playing bibs since the 1990s.
The action has always been active.
I also went to see the junior SM-tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen in the Finnish Championship finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-honey, we're still missing the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
A weekend performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in the field of civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The surge brought down three tents at Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, the tents had a total of about 200 people.
There was a show going on in one of the larger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, an on-duty firefighter interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly left to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with her younger brother Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come in the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always loved to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I have put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank wasn't enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself was really brave enough to get involved in the project and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is going to be fine.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the Young Food Producer competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (since June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported 0.2% positive inflation.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the past 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the prices of the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and scheduled maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter in question was inspired by anime, but some observers think it is racist.
Snapchat's lens tool allows approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that approximate absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unvarnished, feature-distorting tools used to create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have received criticism, where it has been accused of favouring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered a filter to some of its users this week that turned their eyes crooked, distorted their teeth, and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered whether these recurring conflicts point to the larger problem the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday and was written by online outlets such as The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the images was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: "It's hard to deny the analogy of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one taken to a derogatory extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's large audience is made up of young people from more ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect tact even more.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, this type of thing doesn't go unnoticed very easily anymore, as it used to," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published in Medium, he said he believed ethnicity conflicts reflected a lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the management of the company, mostly white and male-only, and concluded his writing with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that their one-sided staff doesn't have people of color to make decisions like this, or they also have people of color as employees, but their position isn't such that they dare to speak their minds directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company has recently hired a recruiter whose purpose is to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promoting inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he will keep his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say this is not OK."
Congressional expert group says military officials falsified intelligence on ISIS
A group of congressional experts released a report on Thursday that officials in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Central Command, modified intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground suggested.
Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee's Intelligence and Defense Appropriations Subcommittee set up a task force to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts. Analysts said senior military officials glossed over their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, or Centcom for short, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior leaders of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground showed, and were invariably more positive than the analysis of other units in the intelligence community," a press release on the report said.
"The events at Centcom are unacceptable — our soldiers are suffering when high-level policymakers are presented with false analyses," said California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"Centcom's management errors extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report details ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops include.
While the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports commissioned by Obama administration officials have been falsified, it does provide an image of analysts that gives the impression that they were pressured by Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command's press releases, statements, and testimony given to Congress were far more positive than the events actually were," the report says.
"For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military assault to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders in the U.S. military are manipulating the intelligence results obtained to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
Republicans set up a task force after learning of the suspicions made by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, is followed by more detailed results, as investigations are still ongoing.
In addition, the Department of Defense's Inspector General has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own results, which were in part consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for assessing intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic representative for the committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "violated the morale of analysts" and "considered inadequately divergent views."
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to align its conclusions with "a predetermined or political official line."
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional investigation.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's Chief Superintendent, which was initiated as a result of lawsuits filed by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the Inspector General's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation has other repercussions besides trying to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more and more defense officials).
However, the allegations made last year called into question how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and that it provides honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on ISIS responds to disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that President George W. Bush's government, despite protests from many analysts, only supported small numbers of troops in Iraq and spent little time reflecting on the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence on ISIS.
According to officials, last year Hooker's task force concluded that despite contrary public statements, air strikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the results of the study were not passed on outside the Central Command, The Times reported in September.
The Centcom commander at the time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after many lawmakers judged the testimony given to the Senate to have been too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as commander of the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth duel in women's field hockey and establishes itself in a showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the United States women's national field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States beat India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a major achievement, but 27-year-old Bam wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of those people who keeps track of the goals they score."
However, he does know this: Americans have won four games and lost zero games in their Olympic tournament and share first place with Britain in their group, who continued their winning streak when they beat Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other in the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Each team made it to the final, which determines which of them will finish first in the six-team group and which will finish second.
The first-place finisher avoids encountering the Dutch team, which is considered tough, for a longer period of time, who won the second group.
Despite what happens in Saturday's game, the Americans have already raised a fuss about their surprising success at these games, four years after it was last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and didn't grab a field hockey stick for the first time until he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played for Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make the final player list.
Then came the 2012 games, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham from England was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not as it is now.
We've made a turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball close to the backhand in.
India had entered the game without a single tournament win, but it proved to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 score until the third episode, when Bam stepped on the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, squirmed into the midfield, hit the ball in the goal, and thus took the Americans 2-0 in the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first in the tournament where U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had sunk one hit each.
Briggs is now living his season of success,
As well as Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic hulina, the trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of time and place, the Olympics are inevitable.
Events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a frantic message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic flame itself were a flaming baton, moving from an archer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast, and from a gymnast to a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian, charms with his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would show up and belong at the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with sponsors, and would appear in good-mind TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further away from the center, in part in the shade are lesser-known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and may the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I may write a modest article about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the past 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has admitted athletes to the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never won any medals or made it to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, the medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side the medals have been scooped by the Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will defend the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of an underdog, in part because to an uncivilized ear it sounds more appropriate for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(I recognize in this context that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The sport has comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless bouncing scenes of the characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jump, that is, species that combine in a trampoline essentially.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish el trampolin, which means "a springboard".
Ambitious masters jump on a huge trampoline, hurling them almost 10 meters high. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must perform a series of acrobatic movements such as twists, folds and flips.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged on performance, difficulty, and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
In pursuit of gold, medal hope must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or starting wall, they also have another goal they pursue in televised reportage, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical —and even enough to bring the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a bit exhausting just watching the games.
For this, the trampoline offers a respite.
In the trampoline, the direction is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down and ejects effortlessly back up.
Of course, the sport also includes the competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a frantic rush to the finish or jumping far, only a dreamy and graceful combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only an Olympic race can get.
The women's qualifying matches and finals take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1:00 p.m. local time and the men's equivalent races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which begins at 2 p.m. local time each day.
In the midst of the Olympic mania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment, which in the midst of the general bustle might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes to watch and objectifying them — as recently suggested by U.S. male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his panting new crowd of fans.
An entire generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dispersed demonstrations calling for political change across Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government protests, which are spreading to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding a radical political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
Videos of the protests, presumably at the end of last year or early this year, show security forces hitting with sticks young people who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
A leading UN human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward is all the more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa project.
Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, after Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are closely supporting the Ethiopians in their fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, with only a few African countries, if any, receiving this much aid from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital Addis Ababa even has a new suburban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from being a model country for democracy; human rights organisations have continuously reported on the government's repressive policies, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly silenced.
Many people have been exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to demonstrate, it will erupt," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All the youth are demonstrating.
An entire generation is protesting."
There are many causes of dissatisfaction, ranging from land use to the stranglehold of the government coalition on power.
After last year's widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously held by the opposition, and as a result they now control the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are mounting along the Eritrean border, where the escalated situation claimed hundreds of lives in the June battle.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood that smoldered beneath the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It is only in the last couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and access to the internet improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many still have access to the internet through proxy servers that conceal their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia's two largest population groups, the Oromo and the Amhara.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas, mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oromos, much of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But this too is changing.
"Collaboration is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have been in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about 6% of the population and yet controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unnamed illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at spotting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors to mediate between opposing sides.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes from near obscurity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not have the confidence of the security forces administered by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested the elections, which government analysts say were first botched and then stolen.
In the post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, though the number of deaths was lower than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not stopped it from intensifying.
And resentment is taking on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the Amhara city of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and anti-Tigre hate speech is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial vehicles monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been shut down, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable allies to collapse.
"This requires a strict balancing act," says Abdi.
Donald Trump Says He Was Sarcastic When He Claimed Obama Was the Founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to retract his words in the latest dispute over his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
The clarification raised new questions for the Republican side about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in an awkward situation, who must try to justify their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments that he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at an election rally Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
However, early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump retweeted his speech the day before, saying in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down from his claim.
The most recent criticism storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton made their economic policy speech in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the issue.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he appeared to urge the Russians to hack into Hillary Clinton's email, later explaining his comments by saying, "Of course I was being sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and retracts his words if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that elicit a response from his supporters. He watches how the supporters react to the messages, and then "clarifies" in one way or another depending on the reactions," says Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has been observing the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also think he understands his claims and knows they're round enough to pass through different screens."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more sharply as his support numbers have continued to decline.
A new poll released Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is strictly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after being under increasing scrutiny in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they are forced to publicly defend Trump's comments, no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider what he said to be a well-founded, political speech," Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely mistakenly called the 'lower-ranking team' and that's why this happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it failed to deal with the situation purposefully in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of dwelling on his speeches and a discriminatory attitude toward him.
He made fun of "unacceptable and pathetic" television commentators who try to find out about him, but he says they can't do it.
Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's explanation, saying it only shows more clearly that he is not fit to be president.
Cafe exited due to disproportionate rent increase opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a somewhat sleazy cafe in Williamsburg that only used cash as a means of payment and had no Wi-Fi, but provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the coffee shop was priced out of its street-side location on Bedford Avenue when the rent became prohibitive.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the shape of cupcakes.
The locals find this loss of a café that has been evasive under middle classization to be lamentable.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB Club is no more, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York is no longer the same, a new one is also being created.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unsophisticated.
The coffee is also good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café.
He started in the Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new coffee shop, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it re-introduced even the lamps of the old Verb.
Rodriguez says that he also wanted to try something new and
Added new products to the list.
There are bacon-egg-cheese-sandwiches available and capers and browned onion rings for filling.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the café, but juices made from fresh fruit instead.
After nine months at the café, Rodriguez says he has noticed that old regulars have started to visit the Verb in a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One such person is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited the café on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks in the Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual iced coffee, which is also a list novelty.
Another long-time client, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited the Verb since 2003.
He always used to go to the cafe before work and without exception ordered the same.
"I entered the cafe every day at 15 minutes past seven, like a machine, and there they were already making my butterbagels with all the fillings," he says.
Image: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard products, but from time to time he varies the bacon, egg and cheese fillings in his bagel.
Rodriguez says there's no hard feelings about the soap store taking the old place.
The owners of the Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made using Verb's own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still take up the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez says he is now looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee at a coffee shop.
The café may also expand into the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the coffee shop closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home," Whitt says.
"I missed the smell of the coffee shop."
The bleak food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office at the White House.
Known as a culinary artist, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious cuisines of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie gras pâté and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: deviled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who are suffering," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds, "It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as food historians.
Coe's latest book, titled Chop Suey, is about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, titled 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is Harper's A Square Meal, published on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and regular lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the major stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich, while 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it would be a good fit for a conversation about eating during the Great Depression.
"The morsel was very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liver loaf, and bean loaf.
They were made of materials that were cheap and plentiful.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to last a whole meal."
Andrew Coe grins.
"It must have been like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eating as much as you want."
Women prepared food for farm workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, enigmatic dishes such as cereal and casseroles became the main food, and casseroles were called "a great way to make use of leftovers" because chefs could cover up not-so-attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years had been the central part of the American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
They experimented with strange blends in which the most important thing was the fulfillment of calorie and nutritional values, rather than taste or even common kitchen sense.
While doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman made onions filled with peanut butter used as a shortage-time dish.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion don't mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be accurate budget-keepers and to meet the challenge of making tasty dishes out of pots like carrot-cream-paget.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reaction to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like the millionaire and refined master he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate in a nearly gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the food served at the White House was not only one of Washington's dullest, but also one of the worst prepared."
Many of the food in the depression period was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
While writing the book, the couple says that they began to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she couldn't throw away food.
"He was really afraid of having to throw food away," says Coe.
"People even started to feel sick from his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"Once upon a time, for example, in a hat."
After the main course plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out their home-made plum dessert, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his luncheon.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a showy name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly dipped our spoons in thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe spent the second time and the third time.
"The walnuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgeter.
Gilead receives full compensation for attorney fees for patent dispute over hepatitis C drug with Merck
A judge at the U.S. District Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to full compensation for attorney fees it incurred for a legal dispute with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. over a hepatitis C drug patent.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of damages of $200 million for infringement of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni in Gilead. A U.S. judge found Merck had committed violations, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In an action filed Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to exemption from attorney fees it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat well over 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the right to private ownership of sofosbuvir, which is under laboratory work.
U.S.-backed forces have captured the city of Manbij from ISIS
U.S.-backed forces have gained control of the town of Manjib in northern Syria near the Turkish border when the last ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the troops said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
A spokesman for the SDF's Manbij Military Council, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that her and her husband had an income of $10.75 million at the time and the actual federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State, announced she had earned $3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton, announced the 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for economic transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and retracts his promises to release his tax returns.
The custom is that U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax records public, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed for an audit of the IRS and call it the reason Trump has not released his earnings data.
"The move is yours," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams tweeted, citing the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he will not allow Trump to release his tax returns until the inspections are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said his refusal to release the information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, his business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this question and posted a video online on Friday in which she highlights prominent Republicans who are urging Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not his public tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has advocated a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At last week's Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway multi-company headquarters is located in the same location, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says he, too, has been subject to an audit by the IRS and that Trump is not afraid of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32% of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual compound tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was earned.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income sum of $109,000.

Chili powder-filled firecracker condoms to support elephant conservation in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have come up with an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements — elephants are chased by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, in collaboration with the American organization Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign to teach volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to scare elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, as now the villagers can be confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
First, the intrusive elephant is harassed by pointing a flashlight and sounding a horn.
If this does not work, a so-called chili cloud is thrown.
The soiled chili powder is placed in a condom together with a firecracker, after which the end of the condom is twisted shut so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is ignited, the condom explodes and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually one cloud of spices is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last resort is the thrower, which fires a firecracker known as a Roman candle into the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticises Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab 'call' — RT News
The French film director, who is Jewish in origin, gave birth to a media frenzy after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel's area code in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
During a recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries that you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel will be completely destroyed - as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to make calls to Israel via a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation about the reception at the hotel.
Lanzmann writes that he was shocked by the receptionist's response.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel's area code."
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the incident was "a great shame".
"The incident is shocking and upsetting to all of us.
It is a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and it is this hotel chain that we are talking about.
That's all the explanation we need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction on the web, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the claims of Arab customers.
"Shame" was said in a publication highlighting the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called what happened a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the area code list was never given," writes a spokesman for the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in protest of Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they rallied to demonstrate against reforms to the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement officials attempted to disperse a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration, who wanted to show their dismay at the government's plans.
Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin has proposed a austerity measure that will close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, temporarily opposing Michel Temer, who held the office of president.
The student protest took place just days after the streets filled with protesters in favor of fired President Dilma Rousseff, with the country's Senate voting on impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the lifting of sanctions, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, Russian companies' interest in doing business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Increasing trade further is, of course, one of the priorities of cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
Trade was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, Russia's foreign mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them travel visas.
In addition, for the first time, Iran was among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia in terms of tourist numbers.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scot Callum Skinner scored as the British won the cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner sprang to fame in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night when the UK trio defended the title earned in London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow played the role of anchor, which he inherited from his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made the legend proud as he raced to the finish line and snatched the victory from the favourite New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his racing career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specialized in the role of the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man the British coaches believed in and where they saw the potential he has now redeemed.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand was faster in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny pushed for the team's lead, which Skinner retained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy so that the Hindes drove to slow down the pace with a larger gear, which allowed Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed from his position as BBC commentator and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eyes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow says, "I'm flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and be successful.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the World Champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to having deliberately crashed on the track due to a poor start.
He later retracted his words, and British rivals had no recourse.
This time there were no problems of this kind with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The atmosphere was like in London, all the British flags were flying in the stands.
Our team became unified over the past three months.
We have lost so many world championships that winning at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress that has been made over the past five months, then a successful five-day velodrome is ahead.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympic Games.
This would mean the account would accrue with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23 (a magical date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medals would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in a sprint that starts today and resolves in three days.
Kenny, a 28-year-old from Bolton, says, "At the moment, I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You get to enjoy the victory together with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest in the four-man team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, set in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (at 10:42 pm) will take place today on the second day of the competition, and Wiggins will certainly be the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with competition officials yesterday before the qualifying, when officials invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now count on its awesome track cycling team to take over the middle of the Olympic Games and bring a bunch of medals to the country.
After the truly extraordinary displays of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, not the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of competitive careers by major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night on the velodrome show that Great Britain's already legendary reputation to rise to the top at the perfect moment is realized once again.
The future of the Portland smelter at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company supplying electricity to the smelter said that one of the factory owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to continue the subsidies that keep the plant in operation.
The fixed subsidy, which has been given for 20 years, will cease in November.
As many as 2,000 jobs are at risk of disappearing from the Alcoa Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk as a result of the closures.
The snowball effect may continue to increase, as the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which forced the Anglesea power plant to close last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures are in line with years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the cost of production at the plant.
AGL, which supplies power to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other smelter owners to also terminate their contracts.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina, with Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp owning minority stakes in the plant.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, meaning that physical electricity demand from the smelter will continue.
The AGL says the agreements are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a notice period of 12 months, so they will expire in 2017.
"Thus, AGL expects the contracts to generate revenue in fiscal year 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its bookkeeping by $187 million "in anticipation of termination of contracts."
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa's ... capacity to keep the smelter operational or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter."
The American company said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to go into effect as of November of this year, although it still needs to figure out why it has now backed down from the deal.
Due to the weak economic situation in the industry, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the smelter in Victoria, Portland, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, Chief Operating Officer of AGL, told analysts earlier in the week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If these plants exit the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand in the (electricity) market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality television star Kendall as cover girl for September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and appeared at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover photo was followed by a quirky (or maybe just Kardashian-series-style?), scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest), pretending to have forgotten his sister's cover photo. The video ends with a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party.
The plot is cliché, and is used in almost every birthday episode of the degree programs (Seacrest utters the words, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character on children's morning TV), but Kris had to get her other daughters involved in some way in this publicity.
For appearing in the September issue of Vogue undeniably marks a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on the cover of Vogue with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release in a year.
The issue, which resembles a large picture book more than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of advertisements).
The September issue's cover star is so eagerly expected to be announced that in the previous two years, the magazine's images have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously, the cover designs for September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models who are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga received the honor.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for her generation, and although she would rather be among the celebrities working for the model, she is still in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or modern-day children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who excel in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of her reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have resurfaced as news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue surfaced.
However, continuing to dwell on dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September issue of Vogue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He is the face of Estee Lauder foundation.
He and all his sisters sell photos of themselves through paid apps.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he shot for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people in the countries are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in funding will have on centres already operating at their limits.
In the state of Queensland, people seeking free legal aid and legal services are already turned away from five people — most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without people fighting for resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that the latest census report by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres shows that thousands of people are already being turned away from the centres each year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the essential services they need," says Farrell.
"People leaving violent relationships, people under an unmanageable and crippling burden of debt, divorcing families, unjustifiably dismissed workers — all of them having problems with legal issues, and this report shows they are not able to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% as of June 2017, meaning that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately phase out these financial cuts so that people can get the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clientele, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun
New York: A lawsuit was filed against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was supposedly taken after its leadership was told that the campaign's North Carolina leader had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a Jeep in February.
The event is filmed in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign, in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally by the campaign, before he realized, in his own words, that this was not going to happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign manager Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the lawsuit, after filing a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Even if the weapon is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini says in his lawsuit.
The suit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused public outrage when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of the second additional paragraph" — who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to choose the judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media took his words out of context and Trump's words did not encourage violence.
In his lawsuit, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifferent leadership and Phillip for assault, assault, and the emotional suffering they cause.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message asking for his comment.
Despite his efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the callback from Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has waged a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow is also revitalizing the economy and creating well-being - not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the point that was of the greatest interest at Heathrow, and like the London Olympics in 2012, we put a tremendous amount of effort into ensuring that our entire nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in areas close to the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think Heathrow expansion is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics were concerned, I was told that Britain would never be ready for them and that we would find ourselves in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked of it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than the few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and boost the economy by £211 billion, bringing skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an on-time and on-budget £11 billion infrastructure investment program that included a T5 terminal — voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years — and a T2 terminal built in the middle of two of the world's most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway backed by a £16 billion private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that there will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow's board of directors and a former Secretary of Commerce for the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocker in cat-mouse play
Attempts by companies that make their money from online advertising to defraud ad blocker software have turned into cat-and-mouse play, says one company that produces blocker software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking ad blockers, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it said users could update their blocking software filters and thus again block social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will change the ad notation codes on its desktop site to make it harder for ad blockers to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says they've figured out the new codes.
In a blog post, Ben Williams, a spokesperson for Adblock, wrote that "such a juggling between the open-source ad blocker community and the deceivers has been going on since the ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be making its own correctional move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use ad-blocking software, according to a survey conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, a figure that has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices every day, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad blockers in its desktop application, as the spokesperson says that mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook found the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also announced that it will update the ad tool for user preferences so that users can more control how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, saying they also prevent some of the regular Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
"Ad-blocking programs are clumsy and inefficient, and that's why we've instead invested in developing user settings like ad tools so people can control the targeting of ads themselves."
Woman commits suicide by being hit by cars on Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking witnesses to help with an accident on the freeway in the first hours of Thursday, in which the woman deliberately got hit by more than one car.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman made her desperate move by lying down on a dark road and was hit by more than one car, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was clearly attempting to commit suicide, including a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
Police say many of the motorists involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have yet to be identified. Police are asking them or other witnesses to report the accident.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
It remains to be seen, however, whether charges will be brought against the motorists involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
That remains for the prosecution to determine," says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where motorists are not held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person was walking on the highway in the dark and the court ruled that motorists could not expect to bump into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of a manslaughter charge after he ran into a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a large amount of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court held that the driving style of the police, who were responding to an emergency call, was justified and that the man lying on the road was "a totally exceptional and unforeseen situation".
Anyone who knows anything about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Has Been Viable
NASA's new climate model estimates suggest that Venus may have been habitable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus's past using the same tools and algorithms used by climate scientists.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions on Venus could sometimes be similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and waterless on the surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to the researchers' previous representations, Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth, and it has nevertheless been spinning slowly.
The model was also used to determine the surface formation of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the modeling of GISS, Venus rotates slowly and has a day side towards the sun for almost two months at a time," said Anthony Del Genio, a researcher at GISS.
This heats the surface and generates rain, which creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions made by planetary scientists about its evolution.
Although Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
As hydrogen karate entered space, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a deadly greenhouse effect —that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modeling in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado vice president/chief executive Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I've held my position as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations with vigor, passion and determination," says Roy, 50, in a statement.
"During the summer, I have thought long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the club's vice president of hockey operations must be in exactly the same line as the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as head coach of the Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the Central Division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not qualified for an extension in the past two years.
The Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points in the 2015-2016 season and fell five points short of the Minnesota Wild as they played for another Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talks and call off strike
The chief negotiators say the North Sea oil workers' wage strikes will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against the oilfield services company Wood Group on drilling rigs in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute."
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of all-day meetings over the next few weeks to deal with the problems of fresh aspects.
The unions justified their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, in protest of possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut tariffs on its North Sea contractors by approximately 9% this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in countries in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the space it needs to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of employees from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, in an effort to make its operations more efficient after its megamerger with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with Labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes the North Sea has experienced for an entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few," says Anderson.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, compared to around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian Cluster to date.
Based on the new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how the orbital times are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's weight and age and even its history of the solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the University of Caltech in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just about to reach adulthood.
They are spinning faster than ever.
When the rotational speed is at its peak, a large amount of star wind is emitted from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they pass through their magnetic fields.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable starspots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest catalogued rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — larger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see in the 'dance' of the Pleiades that the slow-rotating are typically larger, while the fastest-rotating are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of stars in relation to rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides a support pillar for theoretical models of rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to learn a lot more about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotation and stop "dancing".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in their three new articles, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
