Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness and now she is making art on the subject - "A person should have a right to his own body"
Dozens of patient stories hang from the ceiling of the Project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each of them bears the name of Camille Auer.
The papers tell the perennial story of how outsiders have written down their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
Decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to share my person-to-person treatment history to make the violence in the process visible," Auer says.
By process, he refers to the process of gender reassignment.
It is often a period of research that lasts for years and involves meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process is initiated by referral to diagnostic studies of "gender identity disorder", which are conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had used the estrogen he had ordered via the internet and was already very far along in his own repair process.
She felt she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through a correction process in order to be able to correct gender legally as well.
The Transsexual Act (563/2002) obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to get the right gender into, for example, the Population Register Centre and into a passport.
Currently, everyone who corrects for their gender is required to have a psychiatric diagnosis and a certificate of infertility.
It is the right of man to decide his own body.
"This situation is intolerable and violates human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Translain has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations on the law and the European Court of Human Rights has a precedent that obliges the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect their right to self-determination.
The previous Government of Finland prepared the amendment of the Act under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
There were elections and the Finns Party entered the government.
Now the law change is stuck again.
These are internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
"The government doesn't want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
The second consists of the packaging and instructions for use of the drugs used by Auer.
In the patient record installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of Auer by the psychologist of the Transpoli of Tampere University Hospital.
The psychologist met with Camille Auer twice and based on these, wrote a report that would define Auer's right to treatment as well as help.
The subject's sense of reality appears to be vulnerable to vacillation.
The subject's perception of himself/herself appears fragmented in a borderline way and personality-related unstable traits are emphasized.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with a mental illness," Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not granted sex-reassignment treatment.
According to medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
That was when on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of a meeting and kicked the TV from the waiting lounge of the transpol to a broken one.
Later, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded emerged from that television, in which Auer reflected on his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that anyone defined as a woman at birth can enlarge their breasts, but it takes a diagnosis to remove them," Auer says.
Your body is not your own if you feel you are anything other than the amount of your gender defined at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only one of its kind.
For many, the process of gender reassignment is harder for mental reasons than for purely medical operations.
Those who go through it meet dozens of people who need to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy for people in need of support and help to be denied treatment, arguing that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for the process have psychological symptoms behind them: depression, anxiety, possible bullying experiences.
Based on these, the medical staff may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
"Preventing treatment and getting help can plunge a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition publication, Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts all my adult life and that's something that people usually find hard to digest".
Depression has been treated with drugs and when Auer started taking hormones, it made me feel better.
He had finally been able to write down the feelings that had existed since childhood and adolescence.
Why the broad jaw didn't seem to fit into one's body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
"You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using your voice, and moving," he says.
Today, Auer already feels seen, she exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, random comments from loved ones could hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when people close to you missex.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they won't or can't internalize it," he continues.
However, not all trans people need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, there can be no official confirmation of one's gender.
"There is no medical basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In Denmark, for example, the parliament approved a new procedure for recognising the legal gender in June 2014.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination with regard to the legal gender.
The adult applicant submits a written application for a new personal identity code, stating in it that he or she feels that he or she is of the other gender.
After a six-month period of reflection, the applicant confirms their application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity code.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is crystallized in Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still carries weight and that it can bring about political change at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 in the Project Room of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Civil Rights Organization issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for African-American Civil Rights (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri, due to discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The NAACP travel bulletin for Missouri will come into effect on August 28, 2017, urging African-American travelers, visitors and locals to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling in a state where there have been a number of questionable racially-based incidents recently," the organization said in a statement.
A law recently passed in Missouri makes it difficult to take cases of discrimination to court. In addition, the enforcement of state laws disproportionately targets minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be stopped by color and beaten or killed," NAACP Missouri president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of so many cases in such a short time."
The Missouri travel bulletin is the organization's first U.S. state warning.
The organization cited racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri as examples, as well as the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year, driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel, and was arrested by the Missouri Police even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel bulletin also referred to a report by the Missouri Attorney General that police are 75% more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
"The purpose of the travel bulletin is to urge people to be alert and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"People need to prepare, for example, by including money for bail or telling relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, the sixteenth most of any state in the United States.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri's new law that makes it difficult for companies to sue for discrimination in housing and employment relationships.
The ACLU, a civil rights organization that defends constitutionally guaranteed civil rights, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they passed immigration laws obliging police to arrest people for immigration violations.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the State Department and apply to other states; however, recently, NGOs have issued them in response to specific laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for clarification of CEO's supplementary pension
Minister of Economic Affairs Mika Lintilä, who is responsible for state ownership steering, has asked Finnair for an account of the supplementary pension payment received by the airline's CEO Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the minister, it contradicts the will of the state.
The €130,000 supplementary pension received by Vauramo emerged this week when Helsingin Sanomat reported on the performance of directors of listed companies.
Suomen Kuvalehti reported on Vauramo's supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would retire from supplementary pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that supplementary pensions will not be used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year's decision-in-principle on corporate governance.
The sanctions immediately escalated.
Until recently, relations between the United States and Russia seemed to be heading from cold to warm.
At the G20 summit in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin seemed to get along just fine.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions approved by the US Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday were met with bitter reactions in Russia.
The most striking response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said that the sanctions law signed by Trump means a "full-scale trade war".
Even if the Russian reactions were to be dismissed as mere escalations and excesses of political rhetoric, the escalation of tensions between the U.S. and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon following Trump's election.
In the United States, passing the sanctions law on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
Although Congress approved the bill with considerable unanimity, it was reportedly much more difficult for the president to pass the bill.
Trump recently criticized the bill as "significantly flawed."
President Trump's frenzy must have been caused by Russia in particular, although the adoption of a law restricting one's own prerogatives must also have been repugnant.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into both Russia's possible interference in the presidential election and the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia.
Tension between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short honeymoon.
As the White House staff has changed frequently and various scandal-ridden twists and turns have been revealed to be almost updated, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not being conducted in the United States under the leadership of the president, but in spite of the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If the relationship with Russia is strained in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region of the Baltic Sea also tightens relations.
The EU has prominently highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained, at least on the face of it, united in its policy towards Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country like Finland, which does a lot of trade with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real nuisance.
The effects of the recent US sanctions are still unclear.
There have been fears in the EU that the sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the impacts may be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in Fennovoima's nuclear power plant project.
Acidification in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of liquid natural gas (LNG), which is important for the US economy, for example.
Trade sanctions are a means in world politics to show disapproval.
However, economic sanctions must be well thought out and rigorous.
Otherwise, they can easily do more harm than good.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump's White House now has the Statue of Liberty in its sights
Intervening in the statues is the surest sign of a change of power.
Americans know it as well as anyone else: Iraqis, along with American soldiers, toppled a statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's chief ideologists, was well aware of what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN's Jim Acosta. The Statue of Liberty was attacked by Miller in a controversy over the president's proposal to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Miller did not really criticize the statue itself.
Had he done so, he would have been attacked by huge hordes of cruisers and figures imitating the Statue of Liberty.
His attack was on the significance of the statue and especially on the fact that in 1903 a poem by Emma Lazarus was added to the statue's pedestal - 17 years after the statue was completed.
Here's how Miller chided Acosta: "I don't want to go into the history of it now, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom illuminating the whole world.
The poem was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not wrong in himself, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
The touching words of Lazarus, the only one of their kind in which the state calls not only immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The worn-out refusal of your teeming shore."
The poem is more relevant now than ever.
Miller certainly did not engage in literary criticism. He made it clear that the "poorest of the poor" are not welcome in Trump's United States.
The controversy over the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural controversy over the importance of the United States.
After his death, Lazarus' friends campaigned for the poem to be attached to the statue's pedestal. They knew full well that the act was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the connections between French and American republicanism with a classical symbol, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
Adding the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American idea of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh — a mouthman who can now be considered some kind of foreboding of Trump — claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early forerunner of the neoconservatives, who take the torch of the United States to a world covered in darkness: "Lady Liberty steps forward.
He takes the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch does not lead the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partially right.
The meaning of the Statue of Liberty depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of people looking for shelter and a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts by giving hope and welcoming.
Miller and Trump certainly don't want that.
Their torch does not lead the way, but stirs up the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots made it to the UK national team
Neil Black, the leader of the British Athletics Federation, says that the 16 Scottish members of the national team taking part in the World Cup are a "significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, there is "something special happening" in Scotland that British athletics must learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to explore it long enough to understand what's going on," Black says.
"I spoke to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they thought it was related to the Institute's activities.
The Scottish Athletics Federation, on the other hand, believes that it is related to the activities of the union,
and the British Athletics Federation believes that it is behind their actions.
And the average streetwalker thinks he must have something to do with it.
But it's something really great, whatever it is."
Many Scottish athletes compete in London for serious medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000-metre race.
"Eilidh is too modest.
His captain's speech was unbelievably magnificent," Black says.
"Athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated no matter where they happen to live and train.
Eilidh's words had a genuine feeling and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is the silver medallist for the Commonwealth Championships in the 400 metres hurdles, and this is his fifth World Cup. He thinks it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven for 1983 and 2015.
Mid-distance runner Laura Muir has run five UK and two European records during the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London and is also worth keeping an eye on: the man has had an excellent season, which includes wins at the World Championships and the Anniversary Games in the UK.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "hugely proud" of having so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for finals seats and medals.
"It's a great honor to be captain anyway, but it's even more special because the national team members voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the national team.
It shows how far we have come.
They are involved as distinguished athletes competing for award positions.
My Captain's Speech?
I thought it went all right.
I focused on how lucky we are to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home crowd and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know the atmosphere is going to be insanely great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism
The father of our country knew what bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all the domestic politics he could possibly have, all the way to his political principles.
Criticism certainly annoyed,
But he did not silence his critics.
"If freedom of speech is abolished, we may be led dumb and silent like sheep to slaughter," Washington said in 1783.
Which brings us to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their contributors.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association sued Hogan earlier this week.
His staff found the challenge unjustified, and the attitude was also dismissive online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it does matter,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-controlled state.
He has received the second-highest ratings among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not a responsive hothead.
He has led the state firmly and adhered strictly to principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main channel of communication with his constituents and posted a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy there.
Therefore, blocking users coming to the governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff with tax money.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, saying it was only a matter of moderating comments.
However, labeling commentators as trolls, spammers, or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed users blocked by Hogan on Facebook.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They reported that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and factual.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Maryland, was not hostile but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken a stand on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in a Washington Post news commentary.
"I also cannot accept that when more people comment on the same issue, they are immediately perceived as a somehow organized bunch and ignored as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments a "centralized attack." Someone else might call them to advance what is considered important.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or to arrest and silence protesters.
It is the same thing, digitally only.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have sued him.
The first major decision on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
Alexandria District Court judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudoun County government violated the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution by blocking a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Federation went to talk to Kentucky Republican Governor Matt Bevin about the use of Twitter and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
In Washington's day, low postage rates had a similar effect to the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, with anonymous writers hammering Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The pseudonyms Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius wrote letters in newspapers denouncing Washington's decisions.
The President's office was flooded with petitions criticizing the Jay Agreement, the U.S.-British Cooperation, Trade and Shipping Agreement, as evidenced by documents collected by the Papers of George Washington online project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
Summer bird feeding should be stopped immediately
Samples have come from about half a dozen places, plus online adverts for a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern and Southwest Finland, but then also individual ones from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, says Senior Researcher Marja Isomursu from Evira.
Green finches have died of a parasitic disease called trichomonosis.
It is caused by a protozoa called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike pigeons, especially the pigeon.
In the 21st century, however, the disease also began to be detected in finch birds.
In 2009, it really hit the spot.
At that time, trichomonosis caused a major collapse in the green finch population in Finland, after which the strains of the species have been on the road to recovery.
There have now been sick green finches, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, museum master at the Central Museum of Natural History (Luomus) at the University of Helsinki.
It is feared that the previous epidemic of green finches will recur again if something is not done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop summer feeding the birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from home field advantage at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 player Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage for the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Rafferty from Northern Ireland led the tournament last year at the neighboring Archerfield Links field before the final round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty is fond of the new venue and serves as the ambassador for the tournament on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will reach its full glory," Rafferty says.
"Players see the field at its best, it's in great shape.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He is an avid ambassador for the game, and he is proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field."
The Englishman Eales defends the title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenger Tour in his 32-year career.
"This feels like a really special opportunity," a player from Southport says.
"I couldn't defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to me: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a wonderful time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to the action on his own soil, and he joined the tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"Playing at home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I'm happy with my game so far."
The trio are joined on the field by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Six Scots will take part in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Free entry to the tournament. Parking a car costs £5 if there is only a driver in the car, and £10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Possible indoor air problems in the barracks were investigated in Säkylä
No indoor air problems have been found in the Pori Brigade communications company barracks building in Säkylä, at least so far, the brigade reported on Thursday.
Indoor air studies will continue.
Investigations began when a man who had interrupted his military service for health reasons thought his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air in the barracks.
According to Lt. Col. Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, no problems have been identified in the health situation of the other conscripts.
It turned out that this was an isolated incident, and the others who served in that unit have not had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we wanted to get to the bottom of this.
It is not known at this time that we have any indoor air problem, says Holma.
The brigade's bulletin says that due to the July arrival batch, goods have had to be moved to the barracks, which may have caused the dustiness to increase momentarily.
The air may have seemed stuffy because of it, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei does not use a stove in cooking.
He also rarely uses a pot.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in the troubled province of Papua, Indonesia. When preparing dinner, he usually puts the sweet potato — locally "nota" — directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred sweet potato is eaten voraciously with bare, unwashed hands.
Degei's home has no furniture. He sits on a muddy ground floor, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as doing laundry in the murky water fetched from a nearby swamp.
The office of the toilet is provided by a bucket in the ceilingless room.
Degei is the youngest of her husband's four wives and has not been assigned fields to care for.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare peek into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969. The annexation was preceded by a controversial referendum in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed Dutch rule, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta government, which keeps the region under tight control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights observers from entering.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is secluded and bleak. The journey there starts with an hour and a half flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a stomach-wrenching five-hour drive in a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants has wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, whose corrugated roofs have been stained with yellowish brown.
Few Indonesians have been here, let alone journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuan Mee Pago tribesmen worshiped the god Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have any clothes like this," Degei says. She means her colorful, hand-woven wrap-around headdress, her dark skirt, and her brightly colored blouse.
"We used to have nothing but leaves to cover our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are among the highest in Asia.
But it is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Paniai is a highland area about the size of New Jersey with a population of 153,000. Just about 100 kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company based in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in timber reserves.
For Papuans, however, these riches bring misery, as they mean the stifling presence of a strong Indonesian army.
The New York Times revealed in 2005 that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, with individual officers paid up to $150,000.
Papua's demands for greater self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are mercilessly silenced.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killings in the highlands of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s took on the proportions of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 people in the area in peaceful protests.
A 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, We Will Lose Everything, contains accounts of the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electric shocks are particularly popular — and relentless attacks on peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because there are cases every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screw has been tightened as Papua's natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the demographics are changing as Indonesians from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move into the region in search of a better livelihood for Muslims.
Javan warung food stalls sell fried chicken and gado-gado vegetable blend in peanut sauce.
It is difficult for locals to compete.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in the market at a lower price than locals," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Pania and moved to the provincial capital for work.
"Local women lost their clients."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address the injustices and human rights abuses in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 districts, and this former carpenter won a vote in 27 districts, including Paniai, on his way to the Presidential Palace of Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice," You says.
Paniai experienced some kind of trough just two months after Jokow's October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles appeared from the dark.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should wear headlights.
One of the soldiers did not like the remark. According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to reports from victims and witnesses, the children were caught and beaten by drunken soldiers with rifle butts.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kids.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the assault.
A couple of hours later, the building of the State Election Commission near the scene was set on fire, and the next day things began to happen.
About 1,000 Papuans —young men and women and children —gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army command center to demand justice.
They had hunting bows for ceremonies with them, and they began to perform the traditional Waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua, dancing in a ring and imitating bird song.
Some protesters began stoning police and military buildings.
As the atmosphere heated, the soldiers received an order in the internal radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on an official document seen by TIME magazine, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, resident leader of the Kego Koto area, sensed the situation was getting out of hand and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot in the left wrist," he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"Several shots were fired in the crowd."
Alfius Youw was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was indeed him," Yohanes told TIME magazine, sadly. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Superintendent Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"Then it's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I want this case investigated immediately so that nothing like it will ever happen again."
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would launch investigations into human rights violations outside the justice system.
However, he immediately began to recant.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
Most importantly, we have decided to investigate violations, but certain processes are required to do so," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017, Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start an investigation in Papua.
"Everything will be settled in court," he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are related to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in a bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME magazine that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been investigated, including the events in Paniai.
The families of Paniai victims are disbelieved in the allegations.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way," Yohanes says.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he is still living in fear, even though it has been years since the event.
"Yes, I am afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army is going to arrest me, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panians are afraid to discuss the event.
He reports that he had been beaten by soldiers after he helped bury four of the victims.
"Soldiers will seek me out after the victims are buried," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring area of Paniai, Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured in a conflict between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, which started when the manager refused to take the unconscious man to the hospital.
The man who needed hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing on a nearby river, and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers demonstrated at the construction site in front of the company's office.
Police said the villagers stoned police officers who responded with warning shots.
However, according to locals, a mobile police unit of the Indonesian paramilitary police opened fire on the crowd, killing one villager.
"We're terrified. We're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought in for treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
Deiyai's parliament has called for police officers who fired shots to be held accountable and a mobile police unit to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds discontent in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes that live in the lush central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian army soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are from Paniai, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Paniai in the name of "guaranteeing national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds discontent.
There is little rice for sale in Enarotal, and that too is too expensive for the locals,
Just like the bread.
People grow their own food: mainly sweet potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold at the market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, differences in the livelihoods of locals and migrants have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs and they usually go to better educated and wealthier migrants than locals.
Few beaners have enough capital and know-how to run their own business competitively.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The remote Papua gets little attention around the world.
In addition, restrictions on international news coverage remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, although they had been granted a rare photo permit. The official reason was the inability to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kine, Asia's deputy director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has failed to keep his election promises. He has neither increased transparency nor contributed to development by removing restrictions on news coverage.
"Reporters reporting on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua face new risks: visa denial and blacklisting," Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is only under pressure from its immediate neighbours in Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands — called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua's "numerous and widespread violations," including the Paniai shooting.
These states have also traditionally supported the Papua Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering up the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult."
Locals want foreign governments to intervene.
When an official Dutch delegation led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on 4 May 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, an anonymous source who attended the meeting said.
Indonesia has presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokow any more.
"Yokowi means well, but there are people around him who are embroiled in the Paniai shooting scene," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panicians: they live under the rule of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, virtually without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Gobai, Panians, like other Papuans, consider the votes they cast for Jokowi to be a "debt" that must be repaid.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the relatives of the victims of the Paniai shooting once again symbolically demonstrated resistance: they buried one of the victims on the land opposite the police station and army station.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family was killed," Yacobus says with his head bowed.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora slams Robert Helenius' rematch cancellation: "Even his own fans don't want to see"
Heavyweight boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora were scheduled to fight at the Hartwall Arena on May 27.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora lays the blame for the failure of the rematch entirely on Helenius.
My game in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he sucks.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall Arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial scoring decision.
Ticket sales for the rematch went sluggish, and its promoter Nisse Sauerland told Ilta-Sanomat in May that the match had been postponed until the fall.
Nothing new has been heard from the match since.
However, Chisora is no longer annoyed by the cancellation.
The match would have had to be cancelled anyway after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the match date, I woke up with severe pain.
My hernia was about to explode.
At the hospital, they said I had to be operated on," Chisora says.
The British say they are currently in about 45% condition.
He is not interested in a rematch with Helenius, but in Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered Whyte's defeat in December with a split vote.
Fire takes over Torch skyscraper in Dubai for second time
The flames took over one of the world's tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents were forced to flee the 337-meter-high 79-story building.
This was already the second fire within two years in a building that happens to be called Torch, a torch.
The building was evacuated, and no one is known to have been injured, and there was no idea of the cause of the fire immediately after the incident.
"We were asleep and woke up to the sound of the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took about ten minutes," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's emergency services said firefighters were able to extinguish the fire at 4:00 a.m. local time and stayed behind to cool the building.
The government announced that it would provide accommodation for those who left their homes.
The incident may raise questions again about the safety of materials used on the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Torch building board commissioned a study to find that the most damaged were the sheets used for facade cladding and insulation.
In the UK, police believe that the insulation and cladding plates of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu during the night
A moped was stolen from a parking lot in Joensuu between 9 p.m. on Tuesday and 5 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinivaara at Tikkamäentie 2.
Mopo was Sky Team Monkey.
It is red in color, and the registration number is 27-REV.
The moped was found later on Thursday.
The police will request observations of the moped or its theft by e-mail to This email address is being protected from spambots.

Modified on 3 August 2017 at 12:40 p.m.: Police reported that a moped has been found.
More than 20 percent of airline passengers in the United States take on board prohibited items, a survey reveals.
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had deliberately or unknowingly taken prohibited items onto airplanes past U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints. At least six percent of passengers had knives or other items with a blade that they did not know were prohibited.
Less than one percent said they only learned afterwards that they had mistakenly carried weapons, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, a charter airline, and the results reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules than others.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated the TSA rules, 19.7% were Generation Y representatives and less than 15% belonged to Generation X.
Most commonly, the rules were broken by taking food and liquids on board the aircraft.
More than three per cent admitted to knowingly taking articles with a blade into an airplane, and 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men said they knowingly took banned drugs into an airplane.
The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken contraband past security and how many had done so knowingly.
Unsurprisingly, the most travelers are also most likely to take contraband past security — knowingly or unknowingly.
But as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA's guidelines are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take on board and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of the TSA's seizures are liquids.
For a time, there was also the belief that books should not be taken on an airplane.
Liquids may be exported for domestic flights but not for international flights.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his decision to delay decisions made during Obama's term to reduce emissions
The day after 15 states sued Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken under Obama's administration to reduce smog-causing emissions.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he runs takes better account of the needs of state environmental decision-makers than previous administrations.
Pruitt made no mention of the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeals.
States should start to comply with the 2015 Ground Ozone Standard as of 1 October.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the implementation of the decisions for a year so that his agency would have more time to familiarize itself with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth."
Pruitt was the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him head of the EPA. Pruitt is known as an opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since coming to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical industry and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden change of heart is the latest setback to Pruitt's plan to relax regulations.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., ruled that the EPA director overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's decision on oil and gas companies, obliging companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement Wednesday night, Pruitt claimed that his turnaround in ozone regulations would only strengthen EPA cooperation with states in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements on schedule.
"During past administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and then expected to be sued by activist groups and others to reach an agreement on timetables," Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation of our activities and the powers it grants us."
However, the EPA statement stated that Pruitt can continue to use its "powers to delay the execution of decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure the regulations are "justified and based on the best available information."
Republicans are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations in Congress.
The bill, passed last month, aims to delay implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in charge of the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group plans to continue the pressure.
"The EPA's change of heart as a result of our lawsuits is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans exposed to the direct effects of smog in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the lawsuit involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone is created when emissions from, for example, cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe breathing difficulties for sensitized groups of people, and is also a contributing factor to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's surprising change of direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required for the guy in charge of our breathing air to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biodiversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration as its ideological goal is to act on the terms of polluters and other self-serving groups."
Supercar manufacturer to introduce SUV - "happens in Ferrari style"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while striving to hold on to its exclusive status.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in Ferrari style," CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
Details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when an Italian supercar manufacturer presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News reported.
All cases of Eastern Savo measles of the same type of virus
The measles infection in Rantasalmi is of the same type of virus as previous cases in Eastern Savo, THL reports.
The National Institute for Health and Welfare's virology laboratory has confirmed on Thursday that East Savo's fifth measles infection is of the same strain as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that the measles infection confirmed on Friday 28 July by a person from the coastal straits is of the same type as previous cases in Eastern Savonia.
Based on this information, all infections found in Eastern Savonia are related to the first measles found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means we haven't come up with any other types of measles virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth sufferer may still emerge until mid-August, and the epidemic is not yet over, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for infectious diseases in Soster's primary health care.
No new measles infections or suspicions have been revealed since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the up-to-dateness of their own vaccination protection, Erkkilä points out.

Finland prepares for permissible squealing
The moonshine soup wasn't even considered for legalization.
The underlying argument is that the process, along with liquor, produces methanol, which is toxic.
Making a scream at home is legal next year, but legalizing moonshine soup isn't even considered.
The boar is prepared by fermentation, while the moonshine is distilled.
The reason behind the regulation of distillation is that the process, along with liquor, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to enact moonshine soup as a right of everyman, Government Counsellor Ismo Tuominen from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented.
When the Ministry was preparing the reform of the Alcohol Act, the distillation of moonshine was not considered for legalization.
Nor was it brought to the political table.
There was no discussion about the release of distillation, says MP Outi Mäkelä (Kok.).
He is in the negotiating group of the parliamentary groups of the government parties, which took a stand on the reform of the Alcohol Act.
Permits for distilling moonshine at home cannot be granted even on application.
Commercial manufacturing will also remain subject to licence.
Tuominen tells us that there will be a simple rule for home brewing alcoholic beverages: alcohol can be brewed by fermentation at home.
This means that in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can now legally make a squeal at home.
The government has wanted to simplify the regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavours and flavourings and enables the production of a squeal, Mäkelä specifies.
The preparation must still take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavours and aromas created during their fermentation are clearly visible in the drink.
Under the new law, you can make as many drinks as you want, and you can give yourself alcohol as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be put on sale.
The act of screaming is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
A much bigger change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Department of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come before Parliament as soon as the autumn season begins.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä rejoices.
Oscar Pistorius was rushed to hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from chest pains, was rushed to a South African hospital on suspicion of a heart attack.
Pistorius has already been discharged from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is serving a prison sentence at Atteridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pains, but he was released from the hospital this afternoon.
A prison spokesperson confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for an investigation.
A spokesperson for Pistorius' family said the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literary phone conversations reveal Trump pressured Mexico to build border wall
The transcripts of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to stop his public speeches about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States rebuked Snow for publicly knocking out the wall project. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a transcript of Trump's first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which there was a tense exchange of words.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal that the U.S. would take refugees on their way to Australia is "ridiculous", "miserable" and "stupid". Trump said the deal negotiated during Obama's term would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on settling refugees in the United States.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call all day."
Georgia Massacre: Activists Reframed Racist Lynching for Justice
A Ford Mercury car passes a crowd in Monroe, a small town in the Georgian countryside, and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, and four armed men blocking the road before the car reaches the bridge.
The leader of the crowd, a middle-aged man in a striped suit takes a deep breath from his cigar and peers through the windshield.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man fumbles.
"Get out of the car!"
The screams break the silence as a young black man is pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-enactment that aired on July 22, 2017.
However, the sighs of shock are genuine when the noose is threaded around the neck of the "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to stage the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been prosecuted for the murders.
"It is disconcerting that no one has been arrested during these years — even though murderers live among us and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the arrangements for the reenactment.
"It's a disgrace to history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
For him, the reenactment is a startling call to action, as well as reminding the people of Monroe that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want those responsible to be put on trial; we want things to be finally brought to an end, and we want to recover from the grief and make amends, but most of all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of the victim who died in the Georgia massacre on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was charged with murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say the motives for the lynching have been known to locals all along: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were allowed to vote for the first time in presidential elections by a Supreme Court decision. The Supreme Court issued its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was an incident around the time of the election in which black tenant farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently affected Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there were rumors in the city that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her child.
According to FBI records, on July 25, 1946, influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcolm's $600 bail, against which he was released from prison.
On the way home, Malcolm and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and orchestrated the murders," the FBI's statement said.
"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy between state and local authorities involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks puts it more succinctly.
"It was a voter murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to send a message to black people that the same thing would happen to them if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the reenactment of the Georgia massacre for nearly a decade.
The performance is extremely realistic and captivating, a depiction of shocking racism that many would like to believe is already lost in today's United States.
The show is hard to watch but even harder not to look at, which Greene says is the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark sides," the director says.
"But I can't have a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and about twenty whites — gathered to listen to Greene's routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has been playing the local Ku Klux Klan leader for years in the reenactment, but the role is always equally difficult and repulsive.
"It makes me feel dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"However, it is important that this aspect of history is also kept on display so that it will never happen again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, practice their lines.
The show begins with Malcolm screaming and shoving Hester, who is furious that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
"Didn't you hear me? I said get off my land, n----u!"
Rascona, or Hester, responds.
And then the punch goes.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the hardest.
"What?!" Rascona asks.
He's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"No," Greene sighs.
"I just don't think white people used the word n----u at the time."
"Yeah," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang. You'll have to use a longer version."
The subject of the performance is unpleasant, but the room is occupied by a friend spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the performance, but to honor the memory of those who were killed.
The scene starts all over again.
Now Rascona's words are smitten.
Nobody's laughing.
The reenactment ends quickly and violently.
Screams, gunshots —and silence.
A woman in a black funeral costume stands beside the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few dozen meters away, some fifty spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
Nearly half of the audience are black and half are white.
Among them is a couple who have come to see a show in Ithaca, New York, but most are local.
They have visited the graves of the victims under Brooks' guidance in the oppressive humidity of Georgia.
The murders have turned the story into reality, and the atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the singing performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children squat to look at fake blood and immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mutters as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
Actors who played lynchers take off their capes and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man who played the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a tough performance.
"Don't worry," the woman in the performance comforts.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and the actors gather for a dinner together.
A white couple from Altanta are busy discussing the show with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the sensations raised by the performance.
"It's hard to listen to horrible words and watch the horrible actions that people say and do that look like you — just because they look like you," he says.
"My performance made me realize that lynchings still happen," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights to listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he has already started planning for next year's show.
"Re-stage is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we experience, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"Its message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Vegetarianism in stores sparks turmoil: This is how much money is actually saved by removing "extra parts"
Is it allowed to remove cauliflower leaves already in the store before weighing?
How about taking the big hat off the pineapple - it weighs no matter how much?
The answers strongly divide opinions: for one, it is a sign of extreme soreness, while others do not want to pay for the parts of vegetables that they do not use and yet go to the trash at home.
This phenomenon is recognized in shops.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable section of Ruoholahti K-Citymarket in Helsinki, because many people tear out the leaf parts of cauliflower, for example.
From the box, the leaves are taken to the store's biowaste.
According to a news report published by Taloussanomat, snorting at the vegetable counter amazes shopkeepers.
But how much does removing excess parts of vegetables before weighing really save you money?
How significant is the sledgehammer really?
We Women tested how the price changes when pineapple, top artichoke, champignons, broccoli and cauliflower take the leaves or stems off.
Cauliflower: The price of a cauliflower costing €2.10 was €1.80, after peeling off all the leaves.
Pineapple: The price of a whole pineapple costing €2.30 dropped to €1.95 when its stock was twisted away.
Globe artichokes: The price of 2.60 euros became 2.40 euros when the short stock was cut off.
Sponges: Two sponges cost a total of 75 cents.
Without stocks, the price was 60 cents.
Broccoli: Medium broccoli cost 1 euro and without stock 80 cents.
The result: If the leaves and stumps are plucked off, save a few tens of cents on one vegetable at best.
Considered as a percentage, the price of a vegetable fell by up to 20%.

Neymar bought out of Barcelona - Brazilian star signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, AFP news agency reported.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
The staggering €222 million transfer is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros last summer for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The move was blocked by the Spanish league earlier on Thursday after it rejected Neymar's first attempt at payment.
According to the rules of the league, the buying club cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player must buy out their contract, which is done by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, PSG has paid the amount to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will possibly be introduced to a new home crowd in PSG's season opener against Amiens on Saturday.
UEFA investigates details
Barcelona also said in a statement that it would provide information on the payment to the European Football Association (UEFA) so that the union could determine any disciplinary action that might be required in the case.
Javier Tebas, the president of the Spanish League, has accused PSG of violating Uefa's financial fair play rules.
UEFA can punish a club that makes a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period.
According to UEFA, Neymar's move does not automatically violate its financial regulations.
Neymar's transfer to PSG will affect the club's finances for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players for substantial amounts of money, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaifi, a former professional tennis player from Qatar.

Austin, 21, sustained severe burns from lightning strike - flash recorded on airport security camera
Austin Dunn was doing the usual work for a plane at Southwest Florida International Airport with a couple of co-workers when suddenly a lightning bolt struck the plane from the rainy sky.
The force of lightning threw the plane into the ground near Dunn's wing.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said that my brother was electrocuted and he's in the hospital.
I just asked if he was alive," Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and a brain hemorrhage.
It was a tough experience for the whole family.
You can't expect that.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to an airport spokesman, the lightning risk warning system was on at the time of the incident and the carrier itself will decide whether to comply.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revives business by cutting dividends
British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut dividends by 72% when it began a new restructuring program in response to pressure on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the job cuts will mainly be made at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, and the company has already cut 4,000 jobs in connection with previous restructurings.
Pearson announced that it will cut costs again by £300 million in May as part of its third savings program, which aims to revive the business that has been weakened as a result of rapid digitalization.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it would keep its current year's outlook unchanged. Its revenue grew by 1% in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber struck a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army patrol was attacked with a "person-carrying self-made explosive device".
The statement said that all of the injured were in stable condition and were being treated at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents said the Taliban's strengthening and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are of major concern to NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area inhabited mainly by Shia Muslims.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country's deadliest attack by a militant faction since the overthrow of the Taliban by US-led forces in 2001.
The violence highlights the unstable situation in Afghanistan as President Donald Trump considers whether the United States will send more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people's confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay implementation of smog regulations
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reversed its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
The EPA announced its decision to implement the 2015 so-called "ozone definitions" late on Wednesday, saying the decision is evidence of its commitment to working with the states.
"We believe in dialogue and want to respond to the needs of the states," said Scott Pruitt, director of the agency in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the agency's intention to delay the implementation of the ozone specifications for one year until October 2018, according to which smog pollution will be measured in certain parts of the country to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in line with increasingly stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 mainly Democratic-controlled states, including the District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to delay implementation.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to mitigate environmental regulations in Barack Obama's time. According to Trump, the measures are part of a broader program of economic growth.
Trump's measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to the EPA's website, inhaling air containing ozone "may impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in ISIS had also sent bomb building parts to Sydney.
Suspects said the bomb was to be carried on the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before security screening.
Police do not say why the company was shut down.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Deputy Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
Neste CEO: Renewable fuels did well
Oil refiner Neste's profit before taxes declined, but beat forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievonen, the company performed well in oil products, sales volumes of renewable products rose to record levels and the Marketing & Services segment's operating profit development was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievonen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year thanks to higher sales volumes and more favorable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will complete our previously announced strategic investments in 2017," Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discuss a potential match in their first meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match of the near future in the series of under 66.7 pounds, met each other for the first time on Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated lightweight champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, WBO's senior featherweight champion.
Garcia won four weight classes on Showtime on Saturday with the unanimous decision of former world champion Adrien Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five boxers of different weight classes on the comparative list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with the match!"
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at seven on Saturday.
When the two posed for the photographers, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas remarked that the match between the men would be "perfect in terms of sizes".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up the set [63.5 pounds] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I am small for 63.5 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
He's got to go lightweight [61.2 pounds], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be held on the pay-per-view. It is part of his strategy for Lomachenko to debut in the lightweight league later this year and fight Garcia (37-0, 30 knockout wins) next summer. Garcia would also be interested in facing the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will fight in the lightweight league at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight could be on the pay-per-view channel because fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later announced that he was ready to fight on the channel, which offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else attracts as much attention.
As soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "incredible fighter" and that he might go to see the match on Saturday.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's praise and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout."
Garcia said he focused first on showing punching power and then on boxing.
The men said they felt they wanted the match between them to become more and more intense.
"This is the match that is expected.
No other match attracts as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said he expected to fight the best of the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great match."
Average salary 5,300 euros, education what happens - investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talked about a lot lately.
Most recently Helsingin Sanomat told Ritva, 68, to whom the investment advisor of the banker's movement spoke utter nonsense when selling investment products.
Rules for investment advisors and the sale of various investment products will become stricter at the beginning of next year.
The tightenings are based on the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which will become applicable from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the competence of investment advisors and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no competence requirements specified in the law.
The Financial Services industry (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service complete its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of degrees for a company called APV Investment Degrees Ltd, whose degree work group includes experts from the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are 12-15 credits in scope, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website reports that, in general, both exams are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degrees includes 10-15 books as well as numerous other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Examinations Ltd, says that the passing percentage of exams is roughly 70 percent.
Of the personnel of the largest banks, pretty much all those providing investment services have completed either the APV1 or APV2 degrees, as they are compulsory under the company's own rules.
Then there are smaller banker shops without mentioning names, whose staff seems to have avoided completing the examinations, Savikko says.
According to him, there are "a few" such bankers.
Savikko says that since 2000, the APV1 degree has been completed by 13,000 to 14,000 people and more demanding APV2 degrees recommended for investment advisors by about 3,000 people.
Some brokerage firms consider taking a degree to be an advantage.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements.
Savikko says that the recommendation of the Financial Sector requires the completion of APV qualifications, because that is when the expertise related to the investment sector is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, financial and investment advisors earn on average several thousand euros per month, including commissions, fringe benefits and performance bonuses.
The average earnings of the monthly paid regular working hours are about 5,300 euros.
On average, men working in positions earn good 5,900 euros per month and women over 4,500 euros, respectively.
On average, the tenth of the highest earning earns about 8,100 euros.
The tithe of the highest earning men earns more than 9,000 euros per month or more, while the tenth of the highest earning women earn 6,400 euros or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be provided by a licensed company.
At the employee and task level, self-regulation has so far been relied upon.
According to Fiva, its audit resulted in individual cases in which the expertise and competence of the investment advisor were not sufficient based on the advisor's activities.
In principle, you can also act as a seller of investment products, even if your professional skills and qualifications are at a low level.
In this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other industries have significantly stricter competence requirements, Savikko says.
Savikko says that from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
The Financial Supervisory Authority, in turn, will be given the power to determine what needs to be learned.
Marko Hovi, FSA's market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes to the current one is the regulation on the requirements concerning the competence and experience of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to the court, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and tied agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a government proposal issued by the Ministry of Finance, Fiva will probably be given the power to determine competence and experience.
What they are exactly, will be decided by this prospect in the coming autumn.
The company must continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and continuing education.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has a proof obligation to do so as well.
Hovi specifies that in practice, for example, the company must map the job descriptions of the personnel on an individual level.
There will certainly be different requirements for this, depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the court, a new requirement is also to work with someone more experienced than the deadline if the level of knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
That is, if the company hires a new employee who does not quite meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, with the change, the rules become stricter and more concrete.
Legislation on the sale of investment products will become stricter at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane 'draws' giant plane over U.S.
The route flown by the plane was drawn over the United States in the service of Flightradar24.
The flight was conducted on Thursday with a 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing used to test the durability of the aircraft's Rolls Royce engines on a long-haul flight.
In 18 hours and 1 minute, the Seattle-bound aircraft flew a distance of 15,700 km, longer than any regular commercial scheduled flight in use in the world.
The flight remained within U.S. borders throughout the trip.
It flew through 17 states in total.
Imatra's persistent beach swimming schoolchildren are not bothered by the rain or the sun's scorching heat - Iines Kaikkonen persistently polski with the help of the swimming pötkylä
Iines Kaikkonen progressed at a good pace, Taina Itkonen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools run on Slurry and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it rains sometimes and then it shines again, young swimmers are not a failure, says Taina Itkonen, who runs swimming schools.
In this week's swimming schools, a total of 13 children increase their swimming skills, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that then school and eskari already begin, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation by the Sports Unit project and the City of Imatra.
On Thursday, there was a nice atmosphere at the beach in Sette.
The sun was shining and the young swimming school kids were training to stay afloat with the swim buns, someone already without.
Smaller siblings also enjoyed the water.
Iines of Kaikkonen, 5, first doubted going deeper into the water.
However, Taina Itkonen encouraged him to pedal towards the beach.
You're doing great!
He said he went swimming a lot this summer.
Slurry beach is good for him.
Like Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You, too, will be pleased with today's achievements, swimming pedagogues praised.
Jami Kallio, 4, again wanted to have a water fight.
Ilona Villberg, who followed her daughter Anna Villberg, 6, swimming from the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start to learning swimming.
Even though the weather has been what it is, Anna has loved going here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming school kids packed up on the pier.
The boys were busy with a frog found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels on the pier, snacked on the fruit and basked in the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but there was no hurry on the pier.
One that doesn't belong in the summer.
Unknown Soldier Sells Toilet Brushes - "Here's a Kind of Uniting Story"
You see all kinds of it.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the Unknown Soldier product line a couple of days ago.
I mean, dishwasher brushes and clothes racks and "toilet brush with edging brush."
An unknown soldier refers to the film premiered this autumn and the film's marketing.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been mocked on social media: When will the Unknown sanitary napkins come?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määttä, Vice President of Sinituote, say?
We are the film's collaborator.
We are supporting this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult cinema, Määttä says.
According to him, there will be a special introduction to the products, and the film will thus gain visibility.
Isn't there something a little funny about this - often when you think that the products and the stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, this is such a uniting story that we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, Määttä says.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values, which are supported by those who have seen the old Unknown Soldier.
And cleaning is not alien to military culture either, Määttä points out.
Other company partners in the film Unknown Soldier include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall vichys have been introduced to the market, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products already had time to parera Suomen Kuvalehti blogist Kalle Kinnunen
Coffee and watches are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the film's premiere, so there will still be a continuation.
The war products of the unknown have not yet been revealed by Valio, Refiner, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, for example.
New results of Swedish asylum seeker age tests announced
The latest results of the Swedish medical age tests for asylum seekers have been released. The results of the tests carried out with the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of those tested were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not all consider the tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Forensics Agency started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after criticism from the Swedish Immigration Service that it had failed to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be minors.
So far, the Finnish Immigration Service has commissioned 6,880 tests, and the Office of Forensics has now announced the results of 2,481 tests, which were conducted between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty percent of those tested, or 2002 asylum seekers, were determined to be over the age of 18, and in 25 cases, the Forensic Science Bureau determined that the test was "possibly 18 years of age or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker was "possibly under 18".
Tests were conducted only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency says that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly consistent. There are no big differences from previous months' statistics," he told The Local.
Although a large number of applicants were determined to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants lied about their age.
In May, the agency announced the results of 581 tests and announced that 442 cases had "referrals that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it turned out that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that he would turn 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints. Then the images are analyzed by dentists and radiologists. The method has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether a person has undergone puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it, and I don't think the method used is the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't definitely determine the age, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the forensics agency, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of determining a child as an adult is low.
The risk is the highest in a situation where the test subject will soon be 18 years old, when the risk is about 10%."
Ilonen collapsed 30 places in Scotland
Five over par results in the third round spent Mikko Ilonen's 30 points on the result slide down in the European Golf Tour competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Saturday from split 11th place, but was found at the end of the round to split 41st place.
In the difficult weather, Ilonen was joined by one double-bog.
It was difficult for others as well.
Englishman Ian Poulter rose to give the top spot in a one-under-par lap, though he reported that there was enough work on the umbrella holders.
The weather was rough, but I hung around and finally the day was good, Poulter thought.
He shares the top spot with fellow countryman Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia Governor Changes Party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a Trump campaign event that he would change parties.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you after many prayers and in-depth reflections... Today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as Governor of the Democrats."
The crowd burst into applause.
"Tomorrow, I will be a registered member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time for a new game."
Trump previously promised that a major announcement would be made at a West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited his father's mining business and owns coal mines in five states.
His fortune is worth about $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) released a statement Thursday night that "Governor Justice's party change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather build barriers than a better America."
"Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this situation, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that lacks any kind of leadership and is unable to find a positive message that unites people," RNC spokesman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Lightning sown damage - Thursday becoming even summer's very thunder day
By the end of the week, there will be more thunderstorms in southern Finland as well.
During the past week there has been thunder, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
On the night between Wednesday and Thursday, lightning strikes started several fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the hardest thunder day of the summer so far.
Thunderstorms have finally found Finland as well.
During the past week there has been lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country and in the region of Southwest Finland.
At Pöytyä, lightning struck the electrical center of the terraced house, causing a small fire.
The emergency services received a report of the fire about 15 minutes to midnight on Wednesday.
The electricity centre was located in a sauna at the end of a row house.
Rescue services demolished the roof and wall to find the fire pits and quickly put out the fire.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
In Loimaa, on the other hand, lightning ignited the outbuilding on Harjulandie before midnight.
When the rescue services arrived, the building was already in a full fire stage, and the rescue services had no choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
An outbuilding of about 50 square metres burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in Rääkkylä, again lightning struck a detached house.
The occupants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flash of lightning.
The rescue department visited the scene to check on the incident, but this time the lightning did not cause a fire - only a few fuses were blown.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the railway track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa when a lightning strike damaged the traffic control system.
Information about the fault was received on Thursday morning between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., after which the trains in that interval were replaced by buses.
The problem was not fixed until shortly before 5 p.m.
Since then, train traffic has also been able to continue normally on the thunder-stricken section of the railway.
Lightnings have sown destruction throughout Finland.
Lightning, however, has been comparatively low this summer.
These thunderstorms this summer have been absolutely devastating! estimates Jari Tuovinen, a meteorologist on duty at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The thunderstorms on Wednesday and Thursday have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low lightning balance in the summer, many people feel that it is even strong.
This could feel like a really hard thunderstorm, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's thunderstorms, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the ground lightnings blinked 1,700 times, and Thursday has had the potential for even the toughest thunderstorm day of the summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 ground lightnings in the plaque.
If the lightning continues into the early evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-weak thunderstorm year was experienced in 2015, when the number of lightnings in the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, this year's flash count had risen to 18,386 flashes.
So there is still some catching up to do so that this year does not break the "record" of two years ago.
However, thunderstorms can be expected to continue.
According to Tuovinen, the air mass over Finland will also remain warm and humid during the rest of the week, which is a suitable birth environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the thunderstorms is likely to shift from the more northern parts of the country to the south on Saturday, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained on both Saturday and Sunday.
There is a more unified rain front in the central part of the country.
In such things, according to Tuovinen, thunders only sparsely.
Coe praises Russia's 'open-minded' apology for doping scandal
World Athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised the apology he described as open-minded, which Russia made in response to the doping scandal on Thursday. However, Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia's ban on participation.
Russian Athletics Director Dmitry Shlyahtin said at the IAAF Congress on Thursday that the ban on Russia was appropriate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were stripped of their gold or silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comment, the IAAF Congress voted to continue the ban. Russia was excluded from athletics competitions in November 2015 after evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia was presented in a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA.
"I think his response today was very direct, it was a very open-minded presentation," Coe, president of the IAAF, told reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Athletics Federation acknowledged that the country was going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganize its operations."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for lifting the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the working group's recommendation that now is not the time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to normalise the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from a corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes are competing for the status of neutral athlete at the World Athletics Championships in London starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its status can be restored.
"The testing is still inadequate, and the banned coaches are still operating freely," he told reporters Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company was disappointed by the poor success of Tom of Finland
The Tom of Finland film did not have the success the creators hoped for, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed, admits that the film was produced by Helsinki Film CEO Annika Sucksdorff in an interview with Yle.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film premiered in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached over 100,000 viewers, which is a small amount compared to the film's budget of around five million euros.
There was no winning the lottery, but now it is important for investors to get theirs back.
If the film had been more successful at home, they would have already got their money.
Now we have to wait for small streams of foreign spreads, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukoski.
How the Economic Rules of Football Affect Neymar's Transfer to Paris
The regulations restricting the use of money by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from being transferred from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint-Germain in France, the most expensive player transfer of all time in football.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
UEFA introduced fair play financial rules in 2011 which state that PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been funded without major losses.
Barcelona were paid €222 million for the termination of the Brazilian contract, and Neymar's annual salary for the new club will be in the tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG will have no trouble paying Neymar's transfer fee and joining his stellar guard, as the club is funded by a dynasty rich in Qatari oil.
Clubs are allowed to spend large amounts of money to acquire players, but they need to be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not loss-making.
The fair play financial rules were drafted at the initiative of Michel Platin, a Frenchman who was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini felt that pursuing success through debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of fair-play financial rules shifted from clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model first used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 became significantly more difficult to implement. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions, and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the Fair Play Financial Rules will run until 2018, during which the clubs will be allowed to make a maximum loss of €30 million.
Although Platini was forced to leave the role of UEFA president scandalously in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, also wants to curb the reckless spending of clubs.
"Fair play rules are still in place, and we will continue to apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for fair play economics at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of his contract with a lump sum, it can amortize the amount in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be booked as an annual expense of €44.4 million for the next five years.
The first sanctions were imposed in 2014 on the basis of fair play economic rules. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Manchester City, which was funded from Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined €60 million, which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was ordered to limit their Champions League group to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its financial regulations by increasing their income through companies associated with the club's owners.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not count the aid as actual revenue.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that support for PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was excessive.
It has also emerged that some of Neymar's earnings at PSG might be funded by contributions from Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
However, PSG and the Organising Committee have denied that Neymar would be making an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to PSG's previous sanctions, UEFA follows attempts to circumvent the rules even more closely than usual.
Sources who are aware of the situation said Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press on the condition that their identities are not disclosed because they are not authorized to discuss the situation at PSG.
According to the most recent published financial statements, PSG's net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and operating profit was over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements for the last period have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of club products and jerseys.
The club estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30% with Neymar's contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the best players in the world, tried to make Neymar's move more difficult, allegedly in violation of fair play financial rules.
"This is a clear case of economic doping for both the club and the state," Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish League, told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to PSG's Qatari ownership.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger also has reservations about the state funding of the football club, which is owned by an American sports tycoon.
"The incident is the result of ownership that has completely changed the environment in which football operates over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Anything is possible after the state owns the football team.
It's going to be very difficult to comply with the financial rules of fair play, and there are so many different interests involved in having a famous player represent the state."
Finland's World Cup athletes' coach stuck in Helsinki
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and triple jumper Kristiina Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should be coaching at the World Athletics Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without her coach's advice.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump qualification and Mäkelä on Saturday in the triple jump qualification.
However, the two's coach, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to the UK.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British broadcast without success.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organizers as a documentary, but that has not been good enough to get a visa either.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, or not, says Jorma Kemppainen, the head of coaching.
He has always handled visa matters successfully himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Athletics Federation SUL for years.
It's not that big of a deal.
As soon as someone looks at the steps in the stadium, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach's possible absence.
World Cup medal for Finland from London calls for a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will begin in London on Friday and run for a week or so, ending on Sunday 13 August.
Athletics, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are among the sports that Finnish bench athletes can be passionate about year after year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of bench athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other metrics.
Less attention is paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from one championship to the next, where by gaining experience, the athlete's performance is matured to the level that an adult World Cup medal is genuinely possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in Finland's small World Cup team, nor are there any veterans.
The World Cup for Finland requires a miracle.
Fortunately, the interesting and surprising thing about sports is that miracles can happen.
It pulls the bench athletes to the TV screen and glues them to watch the games, even though the London medals are not decided until late in the evening due to the time difference.
Of the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought by the spear thrower Tero Longmäki.
The daredevils are still waiting for Pitkämäki to win the medal, even though the other one is told by his and the other throwers' recent results and Pitkämäki's remaining in the qualification at last summer's championships.
Whatever happens in these games, Pitkämäki will go down in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
For other Finnish athletes at the games, getting into the finals or making your own record is a good enough performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic medal hunt for Finnish athletics in the coming years is given by a good success in the international youth championships this summer as well.
Refining the talents of young people and providing financial support for their work is more important than maintaining a small elite group of representative athletes.
Success does not come overnight but requires years of sweaty work from athletes and patience from both coaching and bench athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
Hopefully, the London Games will go down in history as the Usain Bolt and Mo Farah Games, and not because of the terror scare or cowardly attacks, for example.
Enni Rukajärvi second in Copper's big air - "But I'm sorry"
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi has finished second in the big air race in Colorado, USA.
The second place at Copper Mountain is Rukajärvi's best in the big air World Cup.
The women's race was won by Jamie Anderson of the United States.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
On his last jump, he attempted the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to succeeding.
I feel good and feel good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go quite right.
I will try again in the race from now on, Rukajärvi thought.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jump made for the sport.
Viking Line's new high-speed ferry stuck in port in Helsinki
Viking's new fast-ship FSTR is very late on schedule.
The express ship had to leave Helsinki for Tallinn at 6 p.m.
There were about eight loadings on board.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting to get on board.
Now the car queue is moving a bit, Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting to be boarded at the Port of Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a technical failure with the new ship.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought water bottles to those waiting to board their cars.
Viking's communications manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical fault.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple of hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed by a couple of hours from Tallinn's return voyage.
The ship had to leave Tallinn for Helsinki at 8.15 p.m.
42-metre special transport disrupts traffic on Route 6 on Thursday night
The 42-metre-long special transport moves from Muukko to Mustola Harbour during Thursday evening.
Transportation should be there by 9 p.m.
Police control traffic on Route 6, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
At Mälkiä, the transport proceeds along Route 13 to Mustola Harbour.
Small Circuit Nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story yearns for both the characters' '80s glory days and '90s grunge (around that time, David Wain and Michael Showalter were doing a great The State sketch series for MTV) and their own time — 2001 before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their careers.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the constant reminiscence we are stuck in in the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels out of date.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (it was reported, among other things, the backstory of a can of vegetables speaking with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
At the core of the joke is that middle-aged actors play lusty teenagers approaching adulthood. Highlighting it makes the impossibility of reaching the past part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, in which adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys 90s stalker films, such as the horror film Hand That Cradles.
At one point, one of the characters digs up the Apple Powerbook, inline skates, and "other stuff from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but is still not over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And one crazy plot involves Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) as his accomplice George H. W. Bush (played aptly by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are the side paths.
It is especially fun to see the ever-young Paul Rudd, who has a bearded tassel under his lower lip, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the movie Singles.
Moments of random madness may set this series off as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series until it comes to an obvious conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer - Twenty Years Later. In its final scene, a group of friends go to the premiere of Wet Hot American Summer.
Amazon's Comrade Detective series, on the other hand, appeals to another kind of nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the wrestling catalog of the GLOW series, where the East meets the West.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy series is directed by Rhys Thomas, and made into a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a Bucharest cop couple fight for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
Starring as hard-nosed Gregor and idealistic Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (the series' executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (cops spend time watching chess on TV the same way Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too caught up in imitating the clumsy socialist drama — including a killer hiding behind a Reagan mask, which is why the series often begins to feel like clumsy propaganda.
Six long episodes are too long, and the show's humor is neither fast enough nor plentiful enough.
In summary, the series might work better as an agitprop satire, for example, when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men eating hamburgers in the lobby.
The message to an imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything into consumer goods and fast food.
The fictional Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: we devoured our own recent history and theirs as well.
Kouvola-based Toni Tauru rises to the ring in Macau on Saturday against former UFC fighter
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru faces a tough bone in Macau, as Brazilian Leandro Issa was still fighting in the UFC last year.
The Brazilian also has the black belt of jujutsu and the world championship of the sport.
For once, I'm fighting a parent.
It's funny, 32-year-old Tauru says.
The Kouvolaan was supposed to enter the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three battles were brought on a quick schedule to the Chinese autonomous region of Macau.
Tauru has never encountered such a thing before.
This was the first time my game was cancelled.
It annoyed me because it took a lot of time to prepare and train.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new date for the fight was reached.
Waiting for a week has little effect on preparation.
The transfer will not affect the condition, as it will not improve in a week.
It can get worse if you exercise too much.
In his previous few struggles, Tauru has faced opponents whose strengths lie in vertical combat.
This time the situation is different.
Issaa Kouvola describes him as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
My guess is he'll come in the first round hard on top and try to take you to the carpet.
He's won the World Jujutsu Championship, so he knows how to wrestle.
The previous match did not go as planned.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru hard in the eye, and the win stayed in the Philippines.
I've never fought so well, especially standing up: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit me in the eye.
It was really annoying for a long time.
New Motivation
Some of the free fighters fight once a year, some get into the ring more frequently.
For example, the future opponent Issa last fought in September.
Tauru, on the other hand, had three matches last year.
Now we have the second battle of the year.
Sometimes the pace has gotten heavy.
Over the past few years, I have trained and been in good shape all the time.
But I've only fought for fighting.
When the 32-year-old heard of the upcoming encounter, he decided to change scenery for a while.
I was training in Espoo and got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good trainings when there was a guy from Sweden with us.
The training was a great help, as on Saturday a Kouvola employee will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I've been able to train against opponents of the same size and practice vertical.
Fighting upright is the main tactic of a 32-year-old.
You have to hit rationally.
If there's an opportunity, I'll take the property myself.
The down payments must not be given for free, as they are the ones that consume the most.
Macau attracts Tauru, who had previously fought in China.
They say it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big, big evening ahead.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates unchanged as economic growth has been sluggish and the easing of inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be slow, and the Bank postponed interest rates because of increasing pressures on family income levels.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's Monetary Policy Commission decided by a vote of 6 to 10 to keep interest rates at 0.25%.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank lowered its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 per cent and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6 per cent, and warned that there would be more pressure on household income levels as inflation is expected to continue to accelerate to close to three per cent in the autumn.
According to the bank, however, interest rate increases will be needed in the next few years to curb the inflation boosted by Brexit, and the bank announced that the cost of loans may need to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
In addition, the committee members decided to cancel some of the massive economic package that began to be implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide £15 million more in cheap funding to banks through the programme, totalling £115 million.
The minutes of the bank's interest rate decision state: "According to the Monetary Policy Commission's forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the next few years, as a decline in households' real income will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated that in order to curb inflation, a "some degree of tightening of monetary policy" is needed, with market expectations "slightly wider".
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increases are "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted a 1.9% increase for this year and a 1.7% increase for next year.
Now it kept its 2018 growth forecast at 1.8%.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5% to $1.31; against the euro, it weakened by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made after weaker-than-expected growth rates dampened increased expectations of interest rate increases. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to pick up slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope to households suffering from rising inflation and scarce wage increases, and the bank says that the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a fall in income in the next few years, but it expects wage developments to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by a strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will offset some of the impact of the decline in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were lowered to 0.25% after a shocking EU referendum result that plunged the pound sterling into decline.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to be reflected in prices and the economy only after four years.
Prior to the central bank's most recent decision, the demand for interest rate increases had become increasingly loud as inflation tightened the pressure on households.
Inflation eased to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the excess of its 2% target level was due to a "whole" weak pound.
"Given the recent decline in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market appears to be intensifying as lenders frantically seek customers and want to end the year strongly," said Andrew Montlake, President of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Re-contracts are becoming more popular, their interest rates are low, and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS orders 10,000 controversial HIV drugs
As of September, patients can be prescribed a "transversal" HIV inhibitor. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute over the funding of the drug in the English public health care system (NHS).
The NHS reported that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is prescribed to about 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Pre-exposure drug has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86% in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal upheld the Supreme Court's ruling last year that the NHS will be able to pay for PrEP, although it claims that local authorities should fund it.
Simon Stevens, head of the NHS in England, called Thursday's announcement a "significant new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept enrollments for the trial, which will expand to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug taken before sexual intercourse that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infections in high-risk groups.
A drug taken before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in the body during sexual intercourse to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select eligible candidates for the trial from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partners are not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and enrolled in general practitioner care can also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs £10 million, and the NHS in England signed a contract for medicines this week after an international tender.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence on its targeting, uptake and treatment implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the already existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"It's yet another remarkable achievement in more than 30 years of struggle to solve one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," said Deborah Gold, director of the national AIDS organization.
"If PrEP medication is targeted correctly to those in need and those at risk, it could have a transformative impact on the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, those at risk will receive a drug through an NHS-funded experiment, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It will have an empowering effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news."
"The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group is excluded," says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PrEP drug used in the experiment has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people at risk from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP experiment is a welcome event that went on for several months in vain due to the government's slowness," Sharon Hodgson, the shadow government's health minister, said.
"We have evidence that the drug may have a transformative effect on the work we do to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this threatening disease.
The trial will help us better understand the real benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect those exposed to HIV and get one step closer to a situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully halted."
Quality of life: the mezzanine floor and smart interior design solutions have made the small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker enthusiastic about renovating the properties, moved from the Knightsbridge neighborhood to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a house in the style of Queen Anna's era. The success of the renovation is indicated by the fact that Joanne has not yet packed up her belongings and moved in.
"Before this, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment," Joanne says.
"I'm looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here to the apartment display and noticed that the rooms were as high as they were in my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell in love and made an offer the same day."
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a one-bedroom apartment where the bedroom could only be accessed from the kitchen, and Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to make the most of the height of the room.
"I wanted space, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Notting Hill-based Duck & Shed design firm to take advantage of the space in the nearly four-metre-high rooms and create an apartment that would not just be a remodeling and sale site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"Steel structures are quite complex.
The premises had to be arranged so that there was no need to cower in them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right both above and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full-height rooms on top of each other with fascinating details.
On the intermediate floor opens the Retrouvius copper lattice window to the stylish living area.
Mirror gold furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
Mirrors at either end of the short corridor make the corridor seem longer than it really is.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window overlooking another room.
Mirrored furniture at the entrance has storage space for Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
Adding to the elegance is the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens with folding doors are not a new solution,
But what is unique about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a little planning," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced veneered MDF door.
"It is balanced, meaning it slides very easily when lifted into place."
With sensible space use and storage design, Joanne gained 16 extra square feet, a second bedroom, and an even better layout.
"When selling a dwelling, the area counts — or the valuation of the property," Erfan says.
"Basically, a real estate agent walks into an apartment and calculates the price based on the area."
In Joanne's apartment, the surface area was increased by using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
"The resident is in contact with the materials in the apartment, and the emotional bond to the apartment is partly based on them," Erfan says.
"No one gets attached to the electrical wires running through the walls.
They are important, too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of how good design and additional square meters can make a basic apartment exceptionally fine.
It may also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
Pregnant Princess Sofia radiated in her summer look
Princess Sofia's costume choice was on the button.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For the dinner at A Sustainable Tomorrow, the princess had chosen a light blue dress.
Sofia represented the occasion with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday, Sofia represented the A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body-fitting outfit that gorgeously dressed the pregnant princess.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue ensemble.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents before her birth.
His due date is in September.
For the event's dinner, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed magnificently.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
Pastel blue was a great dress for a princess.
Sofia has been in Båstad, Sweden this week on a representative trip.
Sofia added a little bag to her outfit.
Sofia was radiating in her fresh summer look.
Sofia even got excited to talk to the photographers at the event.
Now I'm just holding my stomach," said Sofia, laughing and referring to her final pregnancy.
He breeds us with sweet chilli
In the summer of 1996, a stall appeared in Lahti Market, selling Thai food.
The people of Lahti did not dare to taste, but walked by.
Food was sold at the stand by Panya Suamsri-Pentilä, among acquaintances Panja.
He did not know much Finnish, and the Finns did not know Thai at that time.
Since the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free samples.
This is how he taught the Bayans to eat Thai food, one spring roll at a time.
Taste it, he said.
I got hooked.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai canteen in the Lahti Market Hall.
There were two small tables, I think there were less than 20 seats.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and places are limited, you can't leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
Little by little we got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat down at a plate with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by on the market hall side, but then the restaurant had to move because they said the self-made condiments smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was opened at the end of the market hall.
There's room.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit at our own tables again, only in the most congested times we have to shyly ask the guests if there is room next door.
Panja knows her customers.
They tell him where they've been and who they've seen.
He knows what food each one eats.
He has seen how the life stages of customers vary and the food company changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring rolls with.
He remembers me as thin and fat, and remembers how I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my place next to the kitchen door and catch up with Panja leaning on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with sweet chili sauce.
He has opened not only our sense of taste but also our thoughts and our hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak Thai to him - thanks to the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panja.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's a hard worker.
On top of restaurant work, he goes to a mushroom and a blueberry.
Last week, the restaurant quietly celebrated its two-decade anniversary.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
With no fuss or attention went this remarkable day, at work.
The discovery of an underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
Earlier this year, security officials received a significant list of anti-terrorism efforts.
The list includes information about more than 170 ISIS fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document includes not only their personal data, but also pictures of everyone.
More than 130 of the people on the list are Iraqis, but there are also six Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
He told me about the list and a couple of weeks back.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been clarified.
According to the newspaper, Iraqi Army Special Forces found a list of the terrorists' identities and photos while investigating a terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul.
U.S. intelligence officials evaluated the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all security authorities in European countries in May.
The underlying fear was that something big and serious was being planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of ISIS in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes not only the names and pictures of all the people, but also their date of birth, fake aliases, and information about the person's country of origin.
The list also contains a breakdown of terrorist specialties.
For example, the German 27-year-old Sami J. on the list reads as Abu Assid al-Almani, meaning German.
He reportedly left Germany in 2012, traveling first to Egypt, then Libya, and later via Turkey to Syria to join ISIS.
A suicide bomber is written as a specialty next to his picture.
There is no further information about the man's fate.
About 6,000 fighters from Europe have left the ranks of ISIS, the fate of which is uncertain.
Man sinks below the surface in Tokoinranta, Helsinki
Based on the interviews with the rescue services, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save a drowning life.
A person who was underwater was rescued in Tokoinranta, Helsinki on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the firefighter on duty at the Helsinki Rescue Department, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
A rescue diver found him below the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue department received a report at half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered to the hands of emergency medical care.
Estlander says it was about a 50-year-old man.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander commends the cooperation of the authorities with the Border Guard and the police.
It was a task led by the Border Guard.
The divers were also very well guided by those present.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Guard and police.
Two cars collided in Eura - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, the fire chief on duty said.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads around four in the day.
The crash occurred when one car turned from behind a warning triangle in front of the other car, the fire chief on duty says.
According to the rescue services, there is a speed limit of 80 kilometers per hour in the crossing area.
Brothers fight over $500 million in real estate assets
The two brothers are arguing over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million, a dispute related to a family business founded 40 years ago by their Italian family.
Colin De Lutis, former president of the Carlton Football Club and real estate developer, lives in the Toorak Value Zone just three houses away from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken to the Supreme Court a dispute over the division of real estate and business assets between the brothers.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute over the divorce.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate property when they bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
The family established a Westco Jeans store there, which expanded into a chain of 160 stores.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping malls.
Under an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul describes his father as "the carrying force and central figure of the family".
According to court documents, the property allocation ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul owns about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties in his proposal to himself," Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was heard by the Supreme Court for the first time last Friday after several attempts at mediation.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has ruled him out of business.
Colin says this is not true, but he blames Paul for mismanagement of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first affidavits that he would like to reach a solution.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," Colin said in a statement.
The cost of the case is constantly increasing. There are hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting firms such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as some of the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and delicatessen shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a store in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first denim store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the final years of high school, when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to move the properties to their sons amicably.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," Anna wrote in a statement.
The other two sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group's business, according to Colin, who gave Mark $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "bitter about the financial terms of their departure."
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the board of directors of the Australian Football League and best friend of television star Eddie McGuire, according to this 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin was the only one who responded, and he said in his text message that he couldn't really comment on the matter because it's going to be heard in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name into a legal battle," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued, saying that he still hoped a solution would be found.
On Friday, hope seemed to have died out.
"Our case will be settled in court in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally make it.
First.
According to Poltico magazine, the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict President Trump's media use and news coverage so that the boss doesn't get into trouble so often.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the White House's new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with executive staff on his first day at work, he raised a key problem he intends to solve: he intends to restrict President Donald Trump's access to information.
Kelly told White House employees that all information — whether printed or heard at press conferences — has to go through him because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump's media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television — and as president, he still watches a lot of television.
"If Presidential candidate Trump got nervous about unfair news coverage, it was worth showing him that the sympathetic media handled things more fairly," Sam Nunberg, a campaign adviser for Trump, told Politico in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "according to six former campaign workers, it is essential in managing Trump's use of Twitter that his personal media flow includes a steady stream of praise."
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to claim that Trump's use of Twitter was ever under control.
Maybe these campaign workers know something the rest of us don't — maybe Trump's tweets would have been even wilder without their efforts.
We will probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff has been able to prevent him from causing trouble even a few times, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing a stir.
Part of the problem is that there are competing factions in the White House that are trying to push their cause by giving Trump information that supports their view. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers deliberately provide the president with questionable information.
Journalist Shane Goldmacher reported on one incident:
"Trump's current and former employees say that he can be outraged by press clippings, especially if they are about malicious data leaks, and then he is absolutely forced to know where the information came from.
That was at the end of February when someone mischievously gave the president a copy of the news from GotNews.com, a website founded by online provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing Assistant Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of several White House data leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, had previously spread false accusations and later retracted them, and did not provide any concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, Trump had begun to ask the staff about Walsh after reading the story."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter had "tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly tries the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still pursuing their own agendas.
These immutable facts make Kelly's mission extremely difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, AFP news agency reported.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar's representatives had paid a €222 million buy-out price to FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona had therefore been terminated, and he was free to transfer to the Parisian club PSG.
The staggering €222 million transfer is the largest in football history.
Previously, the record was held by Manchester United, who paid 105 million euros last summer for Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by Nasser al-Khelaifi, a former professional tennis player from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen overcomes alcoholism and fear of flying with hypnosis: "I'm in the condition of my life"
From the TV series Rose Time and Pure White Sheets, the well-known best-selling author Raija Oranen just celebrated her 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Oras.
Five grandchildren hold Grandma so much in their grip besides writing that Raija and her husband Jyrki gave up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola apartment after 18 winters.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left their rental apartment.
In light and sun, away from the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and alcoholism, which he has survived.
The exterior is 20 pounds lighter.
The weight went down when serotonin drugs were stopped, they were anti-depressants.
I was once helped with alcoholism by hypnosis, which also helped with the fear of flying, I won it.
I have been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Raija and Jyrki Oranen, who also worked in the tourism industry, have been walking together for over 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
That's the kind of drama queen she's always been, ending her life with that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Oranen, who has had a long career as a writer, remembers only the 44-part Pure White Sheets TV series that touched and moved Finland during the Depression.
I finally decided on the clothing industry as a fresh family business when I read Liisa Seppälä's 50th anniversary interview on an airplane.
I was the daughter of a seamstress myself, my mother also had a clothing store and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Oranen recalls.
He felt that the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and dissertation revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen is living an active time as a writer, she has many scripts in the works - hundreds of ideas.
Travellers returned across the ditch to the "Millionaires' Alley"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again on hairnets with the persistent vagrants, who managed to cross the ditch needed by the municipality and return to the field next to the houses.
The vagrants parked their twenty or so caravans near a street called the millionaires' alley in Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross a moat that the municipality needed as a barrier, bringing with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The orbiters managed to cross the barrier at a point that had been left unprotected due to the path.
Enraged residents have accused Solihull Municipality of "complete inability to solve the problem."
An anonymous resident reports that the travelers came Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had been throwing stones at passers-by.
"The municipality must be toughened up to act because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The Travellers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
There were more tonight, and probably more today."
The resident reported that the Municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it's frustrating to pay a municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Travelers returned so soon after they were driven away.
"There are more of them than before, and they have even lowered a horse to graze in the park."
According to a spokesperson for Solihull Municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal steps with Solihull Police to evict the campers as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any disruptive or criminal activity to the police.
It helps to form an overall picture of the situation for a court hearing."
Enraged people surround Portugal crash plane
In Portugal, men who crash-landed on a beach full of people have been questioned in court today.
Two people died as a result of the crash yesterday.
The two men who flew the plane could be charged with manslaughter.
The longest it can get in Portugal is 16 years in prison.
Yesterday, due to a technical fault, the men's small plane had to make an emergency landing on the beach of Sao Joao da Caparica near Lisbon.
Hundreds of people were on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran away from the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The plane first hit a man with his back to the plane.
Immediately afterwards, the plane took off and when it landed again, it hit the child's head," Filipe Janeira told Jornal de Noticias, a newspaper on the beach.
The little girl who was killed was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
Those on the beach surrounded the small plane immediately after the crash, angry.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating on its tail, Celia Rocha, who witnessed the incident, told the Correio da Manha newspaper.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It's a miracle more people didn't die.
The two men on board were not injured in the crash landing.
A Finnish star who tragically lost his leg won another World Cup gold medal: "Without an accident I wouldn't be world champion"
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time at the World Cup gold banked slalom competition held in Big White, Canada.
Suur-Hamari previously also won the World Cross Championship gold.
There are now three MM titles in total.
Quite an incredible World Cup!
Two times were treated gold, with a pretty good heart rate pulled, the telephone reached Suur-Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the sport is increasing all the time.
Paralumiboarding as a whole has grown and developed a lot lately.
The differences are getting smaller, and there are a lot of new calculators involved.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming from behind.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost one leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
From a young age he had been eagerly counting with his friends, and the accident did not take away the desire to get to the slope.
At times it comes to mind what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there's no point in ifs.
The cards that have been dealt are played, the Greater Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to call a serious accident and the loss of a limb a stroke of luck, and the Greater Hamari does not.
But he turned a terrible difficulty to his advantage.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned into a victory.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without the accident.
Before the accident, 23-year-old Suur-Hamar's greatest passion for rafting was already waning.
My job towards the top didn't really start until after the accident.
When I was young, I used to train with guys, and we were always so excited to do X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that faded somewhat over time.
After the accident, I somehow found myself there in the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it beforehand.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to get bitter and sad.
I decided to put on my overalls and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The rider was very pleased to be selected as the athlete of the year by Wheelchair Reeler Leo-Pekka Tähti.
The four-time Olympic champion received his award at a sports gala in January.
According to Greater Hamar, the Star's victory is an important signal to the parasports community.
It was a really big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will certainly open eyes to the parasports world as well.
When is it time to launch the two-time world champion Matti Suur-Hamar's Athlete of the Year campaign?
We'll see about that in due course.
I try to do my best to be successful.
Still, the Greater Hamari has not conquered all the peaks he has coveted.
Next year, there will be a big goal.
In a year, the Paralympic Games will be held in South Korea.
Let's go get a medal!
Syrian refugee youth will not return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country
The A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees baking bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youth do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the war in Syria and the departure of ISIS are the most important things that should happen in order for them to return to their homeland.
The Trump administration is not seen as bringing change to the Syrian conflict.
The communications agency chain Burson-Marsteller studied the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
For nine years, Burson-Marsteller has been studying the opinions and attitudes of Arab youth.
This year, A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees surveyed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24 responded to the survey, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their home country permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of the respondents thought they could return to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the study, young people's decision to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most important factor for a permanent return home, while a quarter believe that the most important thing would be for ISIS to leave the country.
Only less than a tenth of the population sees the improvement of the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria as the most important factors influencing the decision.
Military action alone will not resolve the conflict
Syrian youth were asked which factor is most important for ending the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the abdication of President Bashar al-Assad.
More than a quarter see Assad's presidency as an obstacle to a peace deal.
Nearly half feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
Only a quarter believe in resolving the conflict by military action alone.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see the power of ISIS weakened over the past year, while a fifth feel that its power has strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and terrorism in general, is that the media inform people that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people gave priority to military measures and educational reform.
More than one-tenth felt that the most important thing would be to create better-paid jobs for young people.
When asked about the Trump administration's impact on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the conflict in Syria will worsen during Trump's term.
Opinions are divided as to whether Russia's and Iran's involvement has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half of his time coding to keep the web organized - his database is used by Wikipedia and Google, for example.
Espoo-based company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
The main product of MariaDB, founded by coder entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius, costs absolutely nothing for users, and can be developed by any skilled programmer online.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they are not necessarily paying customers.
With the help of databases, huge masses of data are kept organized and quickly accessible.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter, or Booking.com, they make use of the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in image form comes from the database, and even the images are linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, who is MariaDB's Chief Technology Officer, spends about half of his time coding.
A man who works remotely from Kauniainen takes care to ensure that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed MySQL, the world's most popular open source database, together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later software giant Oracle devoured Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle transaction took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced they were leaving.
"They didn't want to work for Oracle, who didn't make a firm promise about the future of MySQL," Widenius recalls.
He had already established a company at this point that started to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired some of Sun's top 20 developers to make sure the code continuity is secured by the same guys who created it.
Since MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch from it.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of development of MariaDB's code.
"During MySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius laments.
Although many have heard of Widenius and MySQL's billion-dollar deal, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"Over the past few years, our growth rate has been about 50 per cent a year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO of MariaDB.
MariaDB, which focuses on growth, is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is scarce on the company's key figures.
He reveals that during the current financial year, MariaDB expects to receive orders worth EUR 20 million.
Because the database is free, the company has developed services around it that corporate customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's work if the client has used a closed database.
The switch from MySQL to MariaDB is instant because they are versions of each other.
Telefónica, a Spanish operator, and DBS, the largest bank in Southeast Asia, are among MariaDB's paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaba's Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even though we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
"Among our customers are some of the world's largest telecommunications operators, gaming companies, banks and even a few central banks," Paqvalén lists.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side business compared to the company's traditional closed database.
Although according to research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing, tingles.
In a database market of about $50 billion, open source databases don't even reach a billion.
However, the weight of open source cannot be measured only in money, as the majority of users do not pay anything for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop over 70% of their internal applications on top of open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open ones at that time or at least the transition would have started.
Big companies don't get new customers because most of them choose open source next.
This has led to commercial database licensing fees skyrocketing.
Companies want to make as much money as they did before with a smaller number of customers," Widenius reflects.
Because of the pains involved in switching to a closed database, most customer companies have obediently swallowed the price increases.
"There are a lot of customers for whom switching is really difficult because their old applications and others are stuck in a closed database," Widenius says.
Still, he believes that the clientele is about to reach its full capacity.
As license fees increase each year, the client sooner or later migrates to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Besides, many companies are facing major system changes when they move their operations to the cloud.
At the same time, many change the database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a loan of €25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for EIB funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe costs billions of euros annually from databases.
"Many countries want to move to open-source solutions and thus use tax money more efficiently," Paqvalén says.
Widenius is annoyed by how money is wasted in Finland on closed healthcare systems, for example, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it's a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that they cannot invent or do themselves.
The 55-year-old Widenius, along with Linus Torvalds, another Finnish developer of Linux, is one of the most well-known open source contributors.
Widenius helps other companies develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still give 4-5 speeches each year around the world on this topic.
Italy toughens its stance on NGO rescue ships
Italy has warned NGOs rescuing refugees on board their ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue their activities unless they commit to complying with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit to the new code of conduct, it will be difficult to see how they can continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a German aid organisation Jugend Rettet's ship, its crew suspected of collaborating with human smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which operated for only a year, refused to comment on the detailed charges against prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization said in a statement posted on social media.
"We will only be able to assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board boatloads of refugees directly from human smugglers, who regained access to the boats.
One such incident is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometres off the coast of Libya, according to a prosecutor's document, the contents of which have been published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of having defied the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer to supervise the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because they do not create "significant changes or obstacles" to the organization's rescue efforts.
Among those refusing to comply with the Code of Conduct is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, on the other hand, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of the rescue efforts has fallen sharply in recent weeks, which she sees as an indication that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
"In the last few days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed plans to continue talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving for Europe.
Seasonal worker suspected of killing cohabiting partner at Enontekiö, suspect found off-road - case for prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enontekiö Kuttanen last December.
Police say a 36-year-old man in the Czech Republic is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish cohabiting partner.
It has been previously reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect, after what he had done, would have fled with two dogs into the terrain.
The man was found cold in the terrain and did not resist when apprehended.
The lawsuit must be filed in less than a week.
The case may still be heard in the Lapland District Court in August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All-Haired Friends, has died.
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced Thursday by his family.
Born in 1925, Hardy began his acting career at the age of 24 in the theatre.
During his long career, he also starred in movies and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for his role as Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the All My Hairy Friends television series based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC's popular series was filmed for a total of seven seasons.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Text Messages Inciting Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for texting and phone calls she was accused of inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months of her sentence in prison and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of manslaughter, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is devastated," Conrad's father said at a Thursday session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter appealed the verdict and was allowed to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was facing a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter listened to his verdict with his hands crossed, with a tearful look on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He ended Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He has shown no remorse."
Carter's lawyer said the incident was due to "shocking circumstances Carter deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity level, and even mental health problems, had no significant impact on his actions."
The prosecution read a statement by Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which the mother said "Not a day goes by that I won't mourn the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going to get through all of this, and I'm going to do my best to comfort his sisters in the pain that we're always going to carry."
Conrad's sister Camdyn Roy told the court that she was "persecutioned" by the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and be an aunt to his children.
"It's painful to lose someone who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain will never go away," Camdyn said.
The case seems to set a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that inciting suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The incident attracted national attention when it became apparent that Carter had been inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide in his text messages.
"Hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know, there are many ways," Carter wrote in many of the messages he had sent Roy during the two weeks before his death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter not be allowed to profit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has divided the opinions of experts.
Few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published an opinion piece by Knox stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not jail."
NATO secretary general: Relations with Russia worst since Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO remains committed to working to prevent tensions from escalating to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the U.S. and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank Congress for the poor relations between the two countries, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to car manufacturers' setback
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW offered to upgrade the software for more than 350,000 cars.
The head of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more reasonable alternatives than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies said anything about a recall.
European car manufacturers have heavily marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrous oxide emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission-neutralizing devices will increase, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are under close scrutiny, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of coddling major car companies and ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in the cars, which reduced emissions to comply with regulations in tests. In normal driving, the emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but their actions are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development division was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for a possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was implicated in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent European emissions standards. The accusation was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The Audi investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen's position: the luxury car manufacturer's share of Volkswagen's profits is disproportionately high.
Venezuelan vote begins fraud investigation, big protests ahead
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a firm that has no role in the election results," Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Commission, told reporters.
Maduro vows to end the crisis
In a controversial vote in Venezuela on Sunday, a council of representatives was elected to change the country's constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticized the vote and organized protests against its amendment.
The opposition to Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be running at the time of the appointment.
According to El Pais newspaper, the country's national security forces began to take over the country's parliament building on Wednesday night.
The troops are supposed to ensure the safety of the appointment.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Lavender has become a symbol of the Provence region of southern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender had declined due to drought and disease-carrying insects, and scientists and farmers are feverishly trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Lavender is downright endangered in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years and has resulted in a marked fall in rainfall in spring and especially in autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Research Institute in Provence, a specialist in agriculture.
"This will shorten the lifespan of lavender.
In addition, drought has brought a lot of small cicadas to the area, which spread microbacteria."
The stakes are high.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and is also a highly sought after ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
"Instead of tall cobs and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weakened or missing altogether," Chaisse says.
"In other words, there are fewer and fewer components that contain essential oil."
The solution is sought by increasing the efficiency of irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, and spraying with a mixture of clay and water that protects the plants.
Journalist's murder embodies growing threat in Mexico
The editorial staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss how the magazine handles the latest cases of organized crime, corrupt authorities, and the never-ending war on drugs in Sinaloa State.
Today, however, security is being discussed because of the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been urged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists discuss which is safer: leaving the children at home or taking them with them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters for names for each group, there's no need for evidence, there's no need for observations, there's no need for emotion.
Names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or drug cartels are being written on the board, criminals who are making the news coverage of Mexico's chaos life-threatening.
The violence is incessant, and journalists are increasingly targeted. According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012. There are 589 journalists under federal protection who have been targeted by attacks and threats. At least seven journalists have been murdered in seven states this year.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder, journalist and inspirational source of the Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is deeply missed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing a middle finger. The picture reads: "Justice". Journalists in their thirties Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts adorned with Valdez's smiling face. Valdez has glasses and a branded panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, with reporters discussing their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and fears that have become paranoid.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was established specifically for dealing with journalists' cases, but according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been filed so far.
The murderers of journalists are rarely tried, just as of the thousands of murders per year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, few end up in court.
Riodoce journalists plan to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the security conference is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is, frankly, a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the event."
Valdez had left the delivery of Riodoce in Culiacan, the state capital, on the morning of May 15, 2017.
He had only driven his red Toyota for a couple of blocks when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and fired twelve shots. The number is presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelfth river.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors move fast and roam freely in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is still a matter of mouse silence.
Sinaloa has been one of Mexico's bloodiest battlefields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January, with rival factions wanting to fill the void.
In the streets of Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot to death every day, and there are decorative two-story tomb buildings of drug barons in the cemetery that are larger than many homes.
In a coastal state, it is "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a rival faction that is waging war on the Guzman boys.
The story may have angered Guzman's boys: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine entered the outlets.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper publishing the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to establish a Riodoce with five colleagues. The magazine's shares were sold for $50 at the time.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without addressing the drug problem," Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to be known for its bold and honest stories, and its sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-core investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the magazine that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez was awarded the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade relentlessly.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to move on with my life," he said when he received the prize from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "lifestyle" in Sinaloa," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"A journalist has to take on a task that falls to him — or act stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when death was being sown here - why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce's staff miss Valdez - a joker who used to swear like a dock worker. They miss a friend who always gave them a hug and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He always wore a panama hat.
He went to an El Guayabo bar across the street from the delivery and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines killed him.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"Criminals don't like it if we deal in our cases with their women and children and their clean businesses, their secret drug-trafficking airstrips.
They were left out of the story," Bojorquez says.
It meant, even at best, strong self-censorship and self-preservation,
Relying on your own instincts.
If you feel like everything is not right, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, is that "the impression can be deceiving, and it did in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies, and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed in the room where Riodoce's security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had taken shelter in the shade of a tree from a 40-degree heat.
They had been ordered by the state government to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-story building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some journalists half jokingly speculated that the two officers were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider reliable.
Months had passed since journalists had visited the mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
For this week's issue, the Riodoce editorial team planned three main things.
The brother of boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez had been killed in Sinaloa.
The paper also intended to reveal that the government's spending was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor's office, had been kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so one had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was popular with both drug dealers and the authorities.
The journalist learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
Its governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.
Villarreal asked a reporter to write about previous incidents in the same location, and in one of them, "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez' column would provide reliable information about the kidnapping.
"Previously we would have known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been nicknamed "El Flaco", Thinner due to his slim physique.
"Now all communications with our sources are cut off."
Valdez's study has been turned into a warehouse where signs and stickers against the persecution of journalists have been kept. The employees of the magazine have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists for the freedom of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few signs with her when she left the next morning for a demonstration in front of the local prosecutor's office for yet another murder of a journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michoacan state three days after Valdez's murder.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country, with "SOS Press" texts appearing on sidewalks and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is trying to gain international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused authorities of spying on and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since asked to be removed from government cases because he is concerned about not being able to be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organized crime, crime-allowing authorities, and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism, Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed at the behest of politicians and security forces, in agreement with organized crime.
According to the Articulo 19 surveillance team, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were by police and authorities.
"In Mexico, people are silenced by killing," Ramirez says.
Murders have a paralyzing effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body was a note signed by the Zetas Cartel: "I am here for my writings."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some newspapers have decided to shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the March murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach.
Some continue to operate, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez posted a message on his front page to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their states or the country as a whole.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and you have to be on guard all the time.
Sometimes criminals search for a journalist in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once to become a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on its way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, at midnight on Friday, the editors of Riodoce were sitting in front of the editorial office on the sidewalk with a beer after the magazine's latest issue was completed.
Nineteen people had died in the shooting between rival gangs and security forces at Mazatlan beach resort.
The war escalated, as promised in the cartel messages found in the area.
Reporters posted the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk on their smartphones.
The front page had to be redesigned the next day.
Sirens howled nearby —another shooting scene.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers guarding the delivery:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The Riodoce editorial continued the tradition of the newspaper's murdered founder under this massive portrait of a man showing the middle finger to the whole of Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider shutting down the operation. "How could I shut down the paper when our intern asked to go out on the street and do a story the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project started with a huge setback - "Hard place"
In April, Hannu Manninen, who turned 39, had a short party, as a professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training season started disastrously when Manninen fell ill with the flu.
This was the beginning of a long period of illness that lasted almost five weeks.
The month of May was almost completely over when I was sick.
First there was the flu, and finally there was a childhood disease such as ear infection, in which I had to take a course of antibiotics.
I was only able to do ten percent of the exercises planned.
I can't remember the last time I've been sick that long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't take advantage of the training enthusiasm," Manninen tells Ilta-Sanomat.
Test result collapsed
The 2007 World Champion did not receive a training permit until the second week of June, which was reflected in the KIHU Roller Mat Test conducted on 12 June.
In the test, the athlete skis on a rug, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete's fingertip with a needle.
Last fall I was on the mat for 32 minutes, but now I only stayed for 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Manninen says.
For the better
After the initial trials, Manninen says that she remained healthy.
I have done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises to normalize the body's metabolism.
Now we have a really good five-week period.
Midsummer also had a week and a half holiday from flying duties.
My family and I also had time to go to the cottage.
Last season Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen as soon as Manninen reached the 18th position in the top skiing.
Guidelines drawn
Manninen and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have drawn up a training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm for training compared to last season.
After the First Snow Games, Ruka would have a weekend of three World Cups.
In December, it is planned to be part of at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, plans would be to be still involved in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that, the name will be on the Olympic team's list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would already be Manninen's sixth Winter Olympics.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, the Nummela family that celebrated gold in the team competition in Salt Lake City in 2002.
The dinosaur protected itself from its enemies by camouflage.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now scientists have revealed the first research results of a rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers were even able to determine that its scaly skin was reddish-brown and had a "problematic past".
According to Current Biology, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur of all time and one of the best representatives of its kind in the world.
The newly discovered fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-12 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly remarkable discovery.
According to National Geographic, the armored vegetarian is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever.
It was discovered in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that didn't seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery further.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
There, for six years, the beast was excavated from a 1,100-pound boulder.
The results of the hard work can now be seen.
"If you squint, you can almost believe it was asleep," says Caleb Brown, a science writer who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
"It remains in the history of science as the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
Naha's research found that carnivorous dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had armor and resembled a walking tank.
Its red-and-white armor camouflaged it from predators, and it was also protected by a darker top and lighter undercoat coloring, which still occurs in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend in with its surroundings and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old nodosaur made headlines in May and is now on display at the Tyrrell Royal Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have named it Borealope after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was part of a team that took over 7,000 hours to dig up a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected by a common coloring in the animal world, where the body is darker on the top and lighter underneath.
The finding was still a surprise, as Borealope is significantly larger than modern animals with similar coloring.
It can be inferred that the carnivorous dinosaurs preyed on it to such an extent that evolution favored hiding as a means of survival rather than fighting.
Today's animals, such as deer, zebras and armadillas, have similar coloration. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that the nodosaur was seriously threatened as well.
"The predation of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous Cretaceous dinosaurs were," Brown says.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in Nodosaurus scales reveals that its skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions about its life. Among other things, they study its bowel contents to find out what it ate at its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
Alberta was as warm as Florida at the time, and rivers and seas likely extended much further than they do today.
"This nodosaurus is really remarkable because its scaly skin has survived and it has also survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown notes.
"That's why it looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous
It doesn't take much imagination to figure it out: if you squint a little, you can almost believe it was sleeping."
The Cretaceous was an era of theropods, huge bipeds, carnivorous dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years before Borealopelta, its mighty predecessors may have preyed on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, the Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings by Nodosaurus scientists have been published in Current Biology, believing that Borealope was washed into the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
It was discovered in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur with skins and armor from snout to hip.
Nodosauruses averaged five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two six-foot-tall peaks rose from their platforms.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian passed through what is now western Canada until a flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its armor is preserved to the smallest detail in an underwater grave.
Its fossilized remains have been preserved so well that its skin remains in the pitted plates of armor along its skull.
Indeed, Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic that such survival is "as rare as winning the lottery.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
The pitted plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized leather.
Its right forefoot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the scales on its base of the foot."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who do the streets belong to?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived in New York a day earlier from his home in St. Louis and was sitting on the bed of his airbnb apartment browsing Facebook on his phone.
That's when he noticed a message from his high school friend:
"Police just killed an 18-year-old youth, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noted that no one else had posted the same information to his feed. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
His timeline had numerous retweets from @TheePharoah.
The username belongs to a rapper in St. Louis who tweeted in real time about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who had been shot by white police in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user in question had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone down, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, it was reported that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police tapes and screaming people, as well as a man claiming to be Brown's father, who carried a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video showing police standing in front of protesters with a barking dog.
He also says he saw a video of another policeman arming his rifle and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell remembers stating.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we're already used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt the chills.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight home the next day.
Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter at her father's house and decided that they would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been the subject of the documentary "Whose Streets?", which premiered in cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, and strength and perseverance from the perspective of the local people who took to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove toward Ferguson with their daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a matching crown, they had a renewed conversation about "what it's like to live black and under what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?" Ferrell remembers saying to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because an 18-year-old boy was killed by a police officer, and that's not right."
"I couldn't help but take my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of today are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know it and to grow up in it.
He must have the capacity for activism and organization, but he must also feel the different layers and conditions of the experience of living as a black person. And he must know what we need to do to be liberated, to be liberated.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect her from blatant racism, she is still like other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt him if I protected him from reality."
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and eventually learned that no charges would be filed against the police.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to take a new approach to activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was president of an organization of minority nursing students. At the time, he focused on food law and health disparities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the documentary's assistant director.
Folayan said that he and cinematographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted to simply tell" what was happening.
"Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can take advantage of?"
The reason for this doubt was the countless times people, usually white, had appeared in the local community, wanting only to benefit from its hardships and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson didn't have a common voice," Folayan said in a recent interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with prisoners sentenced to death.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project, along with six other locals. The film crew followed the events in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This is not a documentary where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we do," Davis says.
"What really mattered to me was how the local people are portrayed in the movie, because I'm being portrayed the same way."
According to Folayan, the intention was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, as it was to show that the popular movement "is not about a charismatic leader, but about the community".
That's why the documentary features surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked," Ferrell laughs as he tells her what it felt like to see the film for the first time.
"But I understood that this work and the humane portrayal of blacks requires a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story reprises and reprises the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement identify with queer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept the movement going," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is indeed sustained by black women, among whom there are many queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not chosen for the documentary "intentionally" because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, though, that she was on the front line. Black queer women live in the intersection of a lot of things, and they have a lot at stake.
His energy is transmitted from the screen."
News camera crews have long since left Ferguson, but relations between the community and the police remain strained.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of probation left, and he was convicted of blocking a freeway at a rally.
His description of the social political climate in his home districts is brief and succinct: "a mess."
Yet he continues to rely on a slogan he memorized on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We can only lose our chains."
A fitting resemblance: the artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery in New York City has a face hung in the middle of the showroom —white, black, and brown faces, between which one can see a resemblance when viewed more closely.
These 30 works are portraits by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where he served his 35-year sentence. Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Resemblance exhibition opened on August 2, 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning, who combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a trans woman and a pioneering dissident whose prison sentence was commuted by Barack Obama on the third last day of his term in office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 portraits based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, though somewhat theoretical, statement about the malleability, ambiguity, and cause-and-effect relationships and identity behind the interpretations of DNA data.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly stated that she has identified with women since puberty and was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including espionage law violations, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning being sentenced to prison: a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which the troubled Manning sits in the driver's seat in the car, wearing a platinum blonde wig that became his signature.
Dewey-Hagborg had the highly acclaimed Stranger Visions project behind him in 2015, which he carried out in 2012.
In it, he created portraits based on forensic data, including DNA from cigarette butts and chewing gum, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture for their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference for the new show.
Manning could not be visited and could not be photographed in prison, so the paper contacted Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in making a DNA portrait of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned muse suddenly became pen pals, writing to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-authored the Suppressed Images comic book, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted a future where the president would have commuted Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama reduced Manning's sentence just a few days after the comic book was published, a fortunate coincidence after seven rough years in a Kansas military prison.
It's also impressive that the show is opening right now as Donald Trump is waging his own war on data leakers and transgender soldiers and is coming up with new ways to reinforce the powerful divides he was actually supposed to mitigate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everything has a purpose."
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and underneath it Manning's large autograph, in which the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist calls for an end to the "automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long sequence of C, G and A letters written in pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters — or nucleotide, as the artist uses a scientific definition — Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least in our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are equal in our genetic makeup and that the genetic information is very personal and open to interpretation," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"DNA tells countless stories, 30 of which are on display here."
The final work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from the comic book by Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
In it, Manning's character rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can shut you up, they've won," the picture says.
"Never be silent."
"The text is from a letter I received from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold chills."
Contrary to what was described in the comic book, Manning has yet to see the exhibition. When Manning arrives, he is greeted by a face based on his own genetic data like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with a pencil at a height equal to his height (157.5 cm).
"The faces used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring a crowd feel to them," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to film the mass movement that Chelsea gave birth to, which was also behind her release."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
Police say they have launched a nationwide search to find a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury home.
Cook County Court documents show that on Monday arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau's death.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local press release released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police officers alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple cuts on his body.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder. Police are actively searching for the two suspects.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubabage, the university's vice president for social relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior financial aid officer at Oxford University.
An emailed statement from a university and Somerville College spokesperson stated that "we have been in contact with police in the UK and are prepared to assist the investigating authorities in the United States in any way we can."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will surrender.
Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly urges the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, and we are constantly refining our search," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
He said police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the sighting at the scene as horrifying.
Guglielm said it was unclear whether the victim had been murdered the same day or earlier.
He said security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza management team issued the following statement to the residents: "Police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
Man threatens to blow up Islamic bookstore and 'kills Muslims' in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the convicted man told police.
Moffatt is required to perform 100 hours of unpaid community service.
The 39-year-old man was convicted of threatening to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent, David Moffatt was convicted of, among other things, aggravated harassment.
Police said the bookstore staff alerted them to the scene on May 23.
Staff said the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims."
The suspect left the store after threats were made.
Moffatt was caught when he called the police for threats.
The threat had nothing to do with what happened at the bookstore.
Authorities found that Moffatt was wearing the same outfit as the suspect in the bookstore, a police spokeswoman said.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police during interrogations.
As punishment, a man must perform 100 hours of unpaid community service and pay £620, or approximately €690, in legal fees and £85, or approximately €95, in compensation to the victims.
A Scotland Yard spokesperson said several hate crimes were not reported.
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete its actions under the World Anti-Doping Agency's WADA road map to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"Some of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
The WADA road map has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring the powers of RUSADA, the second part of which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing of concern to Russia.
"Everything has been announced, and everything will be accomplished.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future," Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a study ordered by WADA, the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren is investigating the state's alleged role in doping in Russian sports.
Mutko said, "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has admitted failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no government programs, and we can't admit what didn't exist."
Mutko's words echoed the statement of Vitaly Smirnov, chairman of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission of Russia.
Speaking earlier that day to the Russian RSport sports media, Smirnov admitted that there have been problems with Russia's anti-doping agencies. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added, however.
WADA ordered RUSADA to end doping control in Russia in November 2015 after the scale of the doping scandal was revealed.
However, last June it was given permission to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olivier Niggli, Director of WADA, visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow. After the visit, he stated that the organization was "on the right track" towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation skeptical of innovation dear to Finns: There is "no evidence" of health benefits of maternity kits
The British organisation doubts the benefits of Finnish-style maternity kits.
The BBC and the Guardian, among others, report that the Lullaby Trust, which fights SIDS, prohibits the use of its own leaflets in maternity kits distributed in the UK.
The distribution of maternity kits to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
Also in England packaging is distributed in some areas.
According to the Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that a maternity package reduces the risk of SIDS.
SIDS is the unexplained sudden death of a baby.
The Lullaby Trust is the UK health authority's expert on a child's safe sleep.
We will no longer allow our official brochures to be packaged in them because it would imply that we would recommend this product.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per 1,000 births.
According to the Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as the low number of teenage pregnancies.
Giving each family a box there may be one factor.
However, that can't be said for sure," Lullaby Trust CEO Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternity kits are marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and SIDS.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention and has been given free to all mothers in Finland for 80 years.
The kit contains various accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
The packaging itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
The Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to the Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best option for a sleeping place if there is no crib or cot available.
The organization recommends using the kit only for naps and to stop using it when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets out of the pack and making sure they don't get wet or dirty.
A quick-witted villain escaped from a Japanese zoo for the second time
Japanese zoo staff are searching for the escaped turtle.
The giant tortoise has surprised the staff with its speed and has escaped for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the toad left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn't die right away because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we're very worried," Yoshimi Yamane, who works at the zoo, said.
The escaped 35-year-old toad is female, weighs 55 pounds and is about three feet tall.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During opening hours, the villain is allowed to roam freely in the shelter area.
The zoo has not received any eyewitness reports of a tortoise.
The villain's last runaway occurred two weeks ago.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 yards from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help," Yamane said.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Will Help Your Business Avoid Uber's Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he asserted that the surveys were anonymous, some employees were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply neither consistent nor objective," Errett says. As his hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR startups have entered the market to help other companies figure out how their employees are doing.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement, allowing companies to conduct surveys and target specific teams and populations, and provide anonymous reporting services to their employees, and in some cases, direct access to senior management past the board.
"You can track your own health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where's the company's Fitbit?" asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of Glint startup in Redwood City. Glint provides companies with analytics software to measure employee engagement.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years and says he has gained a deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The program can be used to make quick polls and votes for specific teams. In addition, it can be used to draw up a map showing at a glance which departments the employees are most dissatisfied with and which of the managers have received the weakest ratings. Based on these, Errett has been able to drill into the heart of the problems.
Companies have understood that they need to follow a workplace culture in order not to become the next Uber. The transport company has been in turmoil around it ever since a former employee wrote on her blog about a culture where employees are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For startups like Glint, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance is a global industry whose value, according to Let's Talk Payments, could reach over $118.7 billion by 2020.
Based in Denver, Colorado, Convert is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company increased earlier this year when Uber's reputation was hit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
It also recently signed an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, Convert allows companies to make customized surveys, collect responses confidentially in real time, and map problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behavior anonymously via text message.
And if there is reason to suspect the manager of impropriety, complaints go directly to the board of directors of the company.
"Public opinion has supplanted the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convergence.
He points out that if a company mistreats its employees or acts unethically, the consequences can be costly, even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start to boycott the company, and it can also lose employees and be sued.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations and has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and can easily connect to the head office.
It used to be the practice that if an employee wanted to report a problem, they first had to find out the phone number or e-mail address they could use to file a report with the head office. Then they had to file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience," says James Vitrano, general counsel for Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state; now problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more holistic and comprehensive understanding of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we will protect our shareholders from employment-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously after audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of unethical behavior in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only with the advent of social media that companies realized that they could no longer prevent the public clearance of their dirty laundry.
"Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics," Quinlan says.
Glint and Convert offer their software as a service, the use of which is regularly charged.
It is a business model and opportunity accepted by venture capitalists, with both Glint and Convert backed by venture capitalists.
In February, Convert raised $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received €10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are no surprise given the links between business, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a genuinely useful company.
"Employees are more committed to a company's success if they are comfortable with the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of Employee Rewards and Well-being at LinkedIn.
Investors get a return when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it's no wonder they're of interest to investors.
According to workplace culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important,
But it is useless if no action is taken on the basis of it.
If a company asks its employees for feedback, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if change doesn't come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be prepared to have four thousand conversations," says Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, a management consulting firm that has seen companies rely too much on mere data collection.
"If the company doesn't take action, the employees will start to wonder if they were consulted.
and whether their opinions matter at all.
If the company doesn't care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed now conducts monthly employee surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day it is announced in Glint.
After collecting feedback on the slowness of decision-making and the quality of communication from frustrated employees, Errett was able to make changes to teams and organize communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better than ever and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of its staff in an industry known for its high employee turnover.
"If a company doesn't commit to creating a culture of transparency, it will lose employees," Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers, there are no businesses."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of secretly filming his naked female neighbor, the TT news agency reports.
A woman in Gothenburg had come out of the shower at home when she noticed a cell phone hanging at the end of a string outside her window.
According to the woman, the camera on her cell phone was filming in the apartment.
A frightened woman had run into another room to dress.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the mobile phone had been pulled up first, but soon after lowered into the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of filming has admitted to filming the woman.
However, he claimed to have only photographed the woman's face.
The video on the cell phone had been removed, and police had failed to return it as evidence.
During interrogations, the man has admitted the act, but denied that he was guilty of the crime.
The man had justified his portrayal by saying that he loves his neighbor "quite mad".
According to the news agency TT, the man will be charged in the case.
Teachers call for more pay in autumn talks
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the gap should be narrowed," OAJ Chairman Olli Luukkainen said on Thursday.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday bonuses highlights the difference, he points out.
We do not have the opportunity to make such agreements that in some way would not include the holiday pay cuts made.
In the municipal sector, agreements are expected only after the private sector papers have been signed and the increase percentages clear.
Luukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's terms of employment have been agreed on in January.
The percentage targets have not yet been revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a consultative organisation for public-sector educated people.
Luukkainen: Holiday pay cut increases earnings differentials
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of public sector employees, while at the same time the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to Luukkainen, the fixed-term holiday pay cut will further exacerbate the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as the differences between those who do best and those who do weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organization, learning outcomes are deteriorating, and differences between students and regions are constantly growing.
Bruins players' day extended as NCAA reduced daily practice from two to one
It's almost eleven o'clock in the evening, and a group of UCLA American football players have stayed behind to talk to each other on the other side of the campus' new training grounds.
Some have stripped off their jerseys, their backs shiny from sweat after the first day of training camp.
For many of them, this few minutes of conversation is a midday break.
After three hours of practice, players studying in the university summer courses return to the dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning, they meet at half past seven in the Wasserman Football Center.
"The next three days are going to be tough for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora says shortly before Monday's shift to Tuesday.
The university sports umbrella organization reduced the number of daily practice sessions from two to one. The change was intended to lighten the workload of the players, but it has extended their days — at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That's why the first three rehearsals of UCLA started 15 minutes after 7 p.m. It was difficult to find space in the already full schedules of the players.
Limiting the number of training sessions to one per day means that there are more training days than before. The camp started almost a week earlier this year than last year, and this is the first time in Westwood's six seasons of Mora that training is being held at the same time as the summer courses.
The practice is scheduled to take place 18 times before August 20, when actual preparation for the opening game of the season begins: UCLA will face Texas A&M University in September.
Mora says he supported the NCAA rule change, even though it made players' schedules even stricter.
"We load them really hard for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great guys.
I think it's going to get easier when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
It is not easy, given the direct view from the training grounds to the adjacent car park and Luskin Center, a high-class hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs flying over the net behind the goal post.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that problems may arise during the season when rooms are available to outsiders.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The concern is that people can book a room and film rehearsals on video from there. It's not an overstated concern.
A video of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We're doing the best we can.
I'm not going to overdo it.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Rwanda
A presidential election will be held in Central African Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which is already being considered.
Paul Kagame is officially running for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
That was when the rebel group RPF ended the genocide organized by the extreme veils.
Kagame was the commander of the RPF.
Kagame has been criticized for, among other things, crushing opposition and restricting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused of misrepresenting poverty statistics, for example.
Kagame will be able to run for a third term because the constitution that limited the presidency to two terms was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuinely liked leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have taken place and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to question whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame too has promised his people more freedom after the land has been lifted to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook fights fake news by stepping up fact-checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news more and more frequently to independent fact-checkers, as well as present the results below the original article. The world's largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company released a statement on its website stating that it will begin using updated machine learning to identify fake news. Any fake news will be sent to fact-checkers and the results may be published below the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the biggest fake news distributors, with many saying fake news had an impact on the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The topic has emerged in political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news ahead of the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports a plan to fine social media networks if they do not remove hostile content as a matter of urgency.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement released in Germany that fact-checking is being tried in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which stories don't pass the independent reviewers' screen, and they also want more background information so they can decide more enlightenedly what to read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook's news feed, wrote on the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the Related Articles feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Comic Book: The Story of a Castle
The small Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known from the Squeeze music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of turbulent history behind it. Now in a charming location in the Bewl River Valley, this castle is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mop-haired writer fond of old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study a text written by a person who died over 300 years ago," Rhodes says with a longing.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, each illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, he published Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I was moved to tears when I noticed a thumbprint in the letter, written by a double agent who worked for Jacobites in the 18th century," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprint!
And the letters smell like smoke, because at that time fire was used as lighting.
Three centuries later, the scent makes the reader feel that he is on the spot himself.
I love the archives!"
The writer, attracted to old documents, was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and the National Arts Council of England, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in the castle without delay for a little longer than he would have liked.
He spent the days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rarities, such as hyena heads hung on walls and bottles that had been in the moat for centuries.
He toured the ruins and grounds of the old castle and conversed with forest rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists illustrating the book.
In the evenings, he "took a whiskey and began to write."
Scotney's closer history is fairly unknown, as the castle was not transferred entirely to the National Trust until the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived about ten years later, the foundation staff were just beginning to go through the archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything extra to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, and maps of who owned what. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, families fought even for one birch.
It occurred to me that we should have done it by now."
Some of the stories in the book go from castle to English history, such as The Labourer, about a man who joins the English Peasants' Revolt in 1381 shortly after the castle's completion.
"The book 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex' mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
"The English peasant uprising started in the same area, and it came to mind that the uprising could start with a riot.
Perhaps these events are connected?"
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle — such as The Priest, a story about a priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
The Smuggler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite the rascals. They constantly got into debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men in the Darrell family solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old ladies, and I see them as handsome guys who knew how to court heiresses."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Elämäenmäki, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, of which only a eutrophic plot remains.
Scotney Castle holds a special place in his heart.
"It was sad to leave," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to go back to this damn everyday life."
Relations with Russia worst since the Cold War
Relations between NATO and Russia have deteriorated markedly, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg blamed Russia and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think it can be said that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War," Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing instability caused by Russia in the eastern Ukrainian region, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, Stoltenberg said NATO remains committed to working to prevent tensions from escalating to a peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we will be able to engage in political dialogue with Russia to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Prior to Stoltenberg's comments, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the U.S. and Russia had reached a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank Congress for the poor relations between the two countries, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitschko to end rematch against Anthony Joshua won't happen
Vladimir Klitschko, long-time heavyweight world champion of professional boxing, ends his career.
Ukrainian Klitschko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitschko, who struck gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fought 69 professionally, winning 64 of the games.
He held various World Championship titles in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitschko lost the last two games of his career.
Tyson Fury beat him by a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitschko faced Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost by knockout in the 11th round after a fierce match.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to face off in a rematch in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitschko found no motivation for the match.
I deliberately spent a few weeks making a decision to get enough distance from the Wembley game," Klitshko said in a statement.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitschko's reasons for his decision in the video.
Klitshko's manager Bernd Bönte said in a statement that the decision to quit was difficult for Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitschko has been dating American actress Hayden Panettiere since 2009.
The couple has one child, Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitshko's older brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated the World Cup titles of the various federations at the same time.
Finland's weather ployer is witching the conditions: "Take away the feeling"
The pole vaulter Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer outdoor iron season.
Minna Nikkanen has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken away a woman's vibe.
Even the World Cup in London has unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkanen talks about the weather.
Circumstances have been this summer against the pole vaulter Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I couldn't even get the little poles to move properly," Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here God knows how many times and I have never experienced such a variable wind in this place," Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi's Games.
This season, it has been very difficult to standardize the jump, as there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen noted at the Kaleva Games.
The weather also spoke on Thursday in London.
It's been quite a challenge getting the technology back together - whether it's cold jam or what.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken the vibe.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad situation.
He made it to the World Cup thanks to his hall jump of 455.
There's been a 445 out there.
The situation is not the same in London for everyone.
You have to be calm and expect better winds.
The goal is to exceed 460 in Friday's qualifying.
Why don't you move to training abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany.
I got the jump together and standardized the technique.
I probably should have done the same thing now.
Normally you have been able to practice in the hall, now the hall has been closed.
How would it be ideal to race?
Twenty-five degrees.
Even a small wind will do, as long as it's constant.
An experienced ex-officer blunted politicians at Yle: "We don't have any leeway now or for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, Juha Sipilä's government must keep ice on its hat and be careful not to inflate the state budget with debt money, warns Erkki Virtanen, who has been preparing budgets at the Ministry of Finance for decades.
He says there is no division.
In 2015, Yle interviewed retired Virta in Wednesday's First Sámi.
Construction on the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Lately, there have been two political proposals to raise the guarantee pension, lower the car tax and support electric bikes, among other things.
They mainly say that the elections are getting close, because when 10% of the state budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for division now and for many years.
I even think it's a fraud to talk about a division thief when debt is taken," Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen emphasized that all debt is owed to children.
Virtanen has long experience in preparing state budgets: he started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as Budget Secretary and then worked as Deputy Head of the Budget Department and Budget Manager.
The last time he retired, he was the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment.
In an interview with Yle, Virtanen pointed out that the three per cent economic growth forecast now is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is a spike from which we will start to go downhill next year, and Finland is expecting a growth of one per cent for decades.
Washington changes rules for permanent residency
President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent residence permit, the Green Card, will be changed with a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is to be debated in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way permanent residence permits are issued to citizens of other countries.
It will also reduce chain migration and replace the current program.
The new application process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and have skills that benefit our economy," Trump said.
The Queen of Denmark's spouse does not want to be buried with the Queen in the same place
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
Prince Henry and Queen Margaret pictured in April.
Queen Margareta of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henry, 83, are not buried side by side, according to the Danish court.
Traditionally, royal couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal House has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Roskilde Cathedral, the court said in a statement on Thursday.
The reason for this, according to BT magazine, is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the prince has been unhappy with his role and title in the Danish monarchy," Lene Belleby, head of court communications, said in a statement.
For the prince, the decision not to be buried alongside the queen is a natural consequence of not being treated as equal to his spouse.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of her spouse's wish for a burial site and understands the decision.
A moment of terror on the road: The car almost came on top of the freeway
Tommi had a cohabiting partner and two small children on board.
They were not injured in the accident, but will not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The crash occurred at Keimolanportti in Vantaa.
Archive photo from the construction site of Ring III.
Tommi, from Vantaa, says that his family miraculously survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, her cohabiting partner Riina and the couple's two young children drove on the motorway at Keimolanportti in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
From the junction of Ring III to the Hämeenlinna fairway, a white car drove along the acceleration lane, which was to drive into the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without the evasive manoeuvre, the car would have come on top of Tommi.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand," Tommi says.
The family car collided with the railing at high speed.
The parents and two small children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is just under 3 years old, the other under one year old.
I guess it was pretty lucky that nothing happened to us.
No one who drove by even drove towards us, even though there was heavy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car on their own.
Ambulance and rescue personnel arrived, and the family's condition was checked.
The car went into redemption condition.
Tommi says that she and her cohabiting partner have a low income, and they received help from the family to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the information from the other car, Tommi says the family will not get the money from the insurance.
Therefore, the family wishes eyewitnesses to see the car that drove the family into the railing.
We need a car every day.
It is difficult to take children to kindergarten and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, elderly car.
It was probably the late 1990s or early 2000s.
In his opinion, the beginning of the license plate number of the car was SIG.
If the culprit isn't caught, I don't know how we're going to do financially, we're still going to have to count every cent.
Tommi hopes that those who have seen what has happened or know something about it will contact the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Department and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Department confirm that they have had a mission at the scene of the accident on Tuesday evening.
Title and case corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Contrary to what was originally reported in the case, the second car did not enter the oncoming lane according to Tommi, but was to drive from the acceleration lane to the side of the family car.
The performance, directed by Lotta Jäppinen, deals with human relations through humor - The self-exposed artist will be seen at the What? theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first directing to the What? theatre.
A self-exposed performer is a musical theatre performance about failed relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta Jäppinen, it still leaves a good feeling.
The subject is addressed through humor.
There will be no lingering feelings, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the travelling summer theatre performance has been carried out with a tiny budget and a big, young heart.
The title of the performance challenges one to consider what a person reveals about themselves when they get to know a new person.
Maybe he's pulling a role or is he approaching another coat open?
The plotless performance confuses fact and fiction
He has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also in charge of the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group and there is no plot.
The director believes that although the performance draws from the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jäppinen emphasizes that the Exhibitionist does not directly tell about his own or the working group's relationships.
Fact and fiction are mixed.
I'm sure my own set of values will be conveyed by the show.
I don't think relationships are bad, but neither do I think relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents
Jäppinen believes that the Exhibitionist draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many have learned a lot about relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The performance is played by Minea Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes costumer Ella Snellman.
The arrangement of the music is Jäppinen and Rokan.
Love for the theatre broke out in Kouvola
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying to become a director of theatre expression at Turku University of Applied Sciences Art Academy.
There's two years behind us, and there's another one ahead of us.
Jäppinen's enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
Educated in music classes, he has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has acted at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Linnateatteri in Turku.
Directing has become more and more of an interest.
The self-exposed artist premiered last week in Helsinki on the stage of Fool.
A performance lasting about 45 minutes should also be seen in the future, at least in the student city of Jäppinen in Turku.
Exhibitionist in Kouvola's What? theatre on 4 August at 7 pm and on 5 August at 2 pm and 7 pm.
Finnish Olympic champion recovered from a terrible motocross accident for a year - broken neck
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable force of nature as Janne Lahtela.
The Ace of Both Lands toured the world hundreds of days a year for twenty years and chased his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless trainee, but also an experimenter in new species.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on Earth that a Kemijärvi resident has not tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There is always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela was involved in a motocross accident.
As a result, his cervical spine and both hands were broken.
I wasn't working.
I licked my wounds at home for a year, Lahtela says.
Lahtela had bad luck.
He also admits that age may have played a role in the crash.
Driving a bike can sound wild.
But I didn't use it to push boundaries.
It's just so hard as a sport that it's not worth too much for a 40-year-old like me!
After the accident, Lahtela found himself in a special situation.
His busy life came to a halt like a wall.
There was a long run in the back as the head coach of Japan's freestyle national team.
Lahtela started in the position immediately after his own career ended in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be in my seat.
I didn't really do much, Lahtela says.
Even during his coaching time, Lahtela often challenged his protégé on the slope and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that even my own thoughts didn't make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be in place.
I really enjoyed it, because for once, I just got to be.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become Finland's head coach.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll burn out.
It is easier to find places in the body that have been broken than intact!
Without the accident, I wouldn't have realized I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freestyle national team about a year ago.
Around the same time, he found a safer hobby to replace speed sports.
I traded motocross for Frisbeegolf!
It just got out of hand right away.
At worst, I was throwing for seven hours a day.
Although Lahtela has always been a super-enthusiastic trainer himself, he does not insist that his trainees be like him.
I don't force everyone into the same mold.
In our sport culture, there is room to be different and ways to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been in line with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming, and we should be worried.
It's here: a report on the evolution of technology in the sex robot industry — just as it was beginning to feel like 2017 can't get any stranger.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
"We need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously," said Noel Sharkey, a founder member of the foundation and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples, and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being hijacked, but they're already selling quite a lot, and we're going to see even more of them," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sex dolls have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with warm silicone skin and features created with artificial intelligence that resemble human use.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nipples and the type and color of the fingernails.
What is even more worrying is that robots have a "personality" that makes Stepford women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user's preferences, such as being shy.
Roxxxy Gold robots from True Companion have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventurous, and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality conforms as perfectly as possible to the user's personality," the company's website advertises.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be, for example, tired, in a talk mood, or "in that mood."
There are many worrying aspects to the rise of sex robots, which replace real relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and outright rape fantasies, as the user approaches a robot programmed to be shy and resistant, for example.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to a vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex toy.
Their generalization and development tells of something darker and deeper in our culture: a decline from gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one option among others.
Of course, most men do not acquire a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, although the FRR report reported their increasing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena say a lot about the spirit of time.
And many will only begin to behave strangely or offensively when the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have started to become more common at a time when women's rights are under threat around the world and a president sitting in the White House has boasted of harassing women.
The TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Your Slave) does not have the most worrying aspect of its powerful imagery, for example images of hanged bodies and excavated eyes. The most disturbing aspect is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprisingly short distance to get there.
There is an attempt to make sex robots as much like real women (by the proportions of porn stars) as is technically possible.
Developers of robots want their skin to feel authentic and their movements to mimic human movements as closely as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or situation.
They have no will of their own, no history — nothing that implies independence or that violates the fantasy of total submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slaves.
Police suspect two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, group led by ISIS chief
The head of the extremist group ISIS led a group of Australian men suspected of planning to take the bomb to an Etihad Airways aircraft.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a leading figure in ISIS had also sent bomb building parts to Sydney.
Suspects said the bomb was to be carried on the plane on July 15, but the company was interrupted before security screening.
Police do not say why the company was shut down.
Another plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device to secrete toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Deputy Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Due to suspected terrorist plots, four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also continuing.
The Good Side of Trump?
Makes Mitt Romney look like a model of common sense
During Trump's term, it has already been repeated to the point of boredom that families have also been torn apart by the strong division of voters on an everyday level.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, advice columns in American newspapers showed how to get along with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want to burst our bubble of information.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to reunite families.
I'm telling you this because my cousin visited me this week in New York City, a left-wing poet living in Chicago who has long been on the sidelines with the Republicans in our family.
He reminded us that a common enemy can have a powerful unifying effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins — including the pro-Republican sibling he has been arguing politics with for decades — are suddenly and unexpectedly on the same side.
At the dinner table, that's a good thing, but more broadly, there are significant risks involved.
Trump has given new momentum to the left, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we're talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won't be able to stand up to his tricks anymore.
In the long run, there is an even more ghastly possibility that Trump will normalize the right extreme Republicans, who, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I reminisce about Mitt Romney's understated version of madness: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns). Compared to Trump, they seem like very mild offenses.
When Trump's term is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be lucid, and that immediately feels like a substantial improvement.
While my cousin was visiting me, we took our kids to Central Park Carousel, the largest carousel in the New York Parks Department and the best you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
The horses on the merry-go-round are huge, the characters in the middle — grotesque clowns and terrified animals looking back — are ominous, and the clanging music in the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York City's hallmarks become disillusioned over time: the views from the tall buildings begin to bore, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar, and the reality of the city does not match the dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven't completely gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large roundabout in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-style pub though, but that doesn't count.
The Central Park Carousel, on the other hand, is still a strangely magical experience — so much so that two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two women in their forties enjoy it immensely.
I would have given the carousel a full score if anyone had asked for my review, but thankfully no one came to ask.
Instead, this week I was asked to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before putting my credit card on a reader.
The same thing happens in a cafe in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine the estimate with a 15% service allowance when I go to the counter to pick up the coffee myself.
This slows down everyday interaction and puts pressure on the customer service staff to put their persona on the line in a situation where it is not needed.
The clerk of the department store smiled with regret as I tiredly gave my credit card experience five stars.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no trust of management"
FC Inter have today relieved Shefki Kuqi of his duties as coach of the club's representative team.
The coaching responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccareta, who previously served as assistant coach.
The rest of the coaching team will continue in their current roles.
Italian Piccareta has previously served as assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
51-year-old Piccareta, who joined Inter's coaching team in January, has completed a UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Inter Chairman of the Board Stefan Håkans regrets what happened.
Changing a coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuqi no longer had the trust of the club's management, so there was now no other option," Håkans said in a statement.
Piccareta's contract is valid until the end of the season.
He, along with the rest of the coaching team, will be in charge as early as tomorrow's home game against HIFK.
According to reports, the team has been in turmoil since Thursday.
On Thursday morning, Kuqi told the players that the club's assistant coaches Piccareta and John Allen have been set aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta clashed heavily in Inter's match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth photo from the '80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violin virtuoso, posted a youth photo on Instagram.
Several hastages have been added to the picture, which can be used to conclude that the musician is a 16-year-old Sibelius Academy student in the picture.
Lampenius himself seriously wonders at the young woman looking at the camera.
A long time ago, serious, he signals.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A little over a year ago, he posted a picture of himself on Instagram.
In one picture she is seen 20 years ago, in the other she poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius reflects on his own growth as a person and refers to the eating disorders he suffered from when he was younger.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and how I look.
After the text she had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, insecure, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders of previous years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 due to anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also developed bulimia, which was not revealed until 2006.
The healing began slowly.
In addition to therapy and peer support, Lampenius was helped by a new love.
Oscar Pistorius Sent from Prison to Hospital for Chest Pains
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for incisions in his wrists, which, according to prison officials, he received after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed the original manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting multiple shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius' six-year sentence too lenient.
The Prosecutor General plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal will possibly be heard as early as this year.
If the appeal is upheld, Pistorius' sentence could be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country's foreign ministry reported, according to the bTV channel.
Police arrested a group of unauthorized campers in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st, two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had liberated the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free campsites and are already imposing substantial fines on anyone camping outside the designated areas.
Inspections will continue until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the court may impose a fine.
Neste's stock sinks - already sunk -7.7%
Oil refiner Neste's share has sunk 7.7% at around 11 a.m.
Its profit before taxes declined, but exceeded the forecast compiled by Inquiry Financial.
Stock exchange trading has started today slightly below freezing both in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
Shortly after the stock exchanges opened, the broad European Stoxx 600 index had fallen 0.2%.
After about half an hour of trading, the Helsinki Stock Exchange's general index OMXH had fallen 0.3% to 9509.48 points and the most traded companies' OMXH25 had fallen 0.3%.
The total turnover of the stock exchange was 41 million euros, of which nine million were Neste, the result announcer of the morning.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like nightmares in the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet high in meat protein and dairy products may ease irritable bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable disease affecting approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, causing abdominal cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Those with irritable bowel syndrome are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps the body develop immune cells that strengthen gut tolerance.
According to Marco Colonna, director of the study, immune cells guard from the swamp and ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Inflammatory cells are balanced by cells that strengthen tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to the inflammation, an irritable bowel syndrome may result.
In experiments, it was found that immune cells that strengthen tolerance are found in mice with certain bacteria in their intestines.
The bacterium in question needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuteri and the development of tolerance cells. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the normal gut microbiome," Professor Colonna says.
"The more tryptophan in mice's diet, the more immune cells they had."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri and a diet high in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce susceptibility to inflammation.
While studying immune cells that strengthen tolerance, postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had such cells, they did not exist in mice of the same species that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbiomes of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was examined, six species of bacteria were found in mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice that grew in a sterile environment and did not have a gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They grew Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid — without bacteria — to immature immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells evolved into tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's diet, the number of cells that boosted tolerance increased by about 50 percent.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether tryptophan byproducts from Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic defects associated with tryptophan have been observed in people with irritable bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the inner surfaces of the intestines," Cervantes-Barragan says.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United got a "genius" after signing Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "genius" after signing Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut for Manchester United in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Moving from Chelsea for £40 million, Matic started with a 2-1 win in Dublin, United's final game of the season before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He impressed as a defensive midfielder against stars such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic wasn't in the best shape yet because he wasn't on the Asian Blue Shirts tour before the start of the season. He only made it on the field for 45 minutes - that's a change that Mourinho says must come before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and mindset make him a genius — he has a natural football mindset," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to file his starting line-up for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more players, although the club has already done a "great job" by getting three of the four players he has prioritized.
"Three out of four - you have to thank the club for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Volleyball women bullied Germany for two rounds
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth match of the World Cup qualification tournament to Germany by a straight 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
Germany's standard of play is high.
Their game was even in every sector, Finland's head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a press release.
In the first two rounds, Finland kept its opponents in a tight spot, but in the third round, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the block.
When we played patiently and aggressively enough in certain places, we were able to swing along, Kangasniemi said.
Piia Korhonen, who had 14 points, was the most effective in Finland.
Three games out of four losing Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: Grand jury already sent subpoenas over Trump Jr. meeting with Russia
In the United States, a grand jury has sent subpoenas regarding a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A grand jury convened by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has already sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for her Kremlin affiliations.
Reuters, the news agency, at the same time confirms the information revealed earlier Thursday by the Wall Street Journal about the grand jury being convened.
According to Reuters, the grand jury has sent subpoenas in connection with a meeting between Trump Jr. and the Kremlin-linked Veselnitskaya, which took place in the middle of the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
Also present were Donald Trump Sr.'s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the White House's current adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington means that the pace of the Russia investigation is getting closer.
Sources add that Mueller sought the help of a grand jury to investigate Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump's campaign or those close to him cooperated with Russia.
The grand jury expands Mueller's rights to gather evidence, submit subpoenas, and force people to testify on oath.
A large number of jurors are a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence the prosecution has investigated and decides whether charges should be brought in the case.
British inventor microchipped himself to get into his home and car with a swing of his hand
The British inventor is the first person in the country to microchip himself so he can open the front door of his home, get into his office, and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and forefinger of 33-year-old Steven Northam, now providing a service to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam's BioTeq technology.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, a consulting anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the microchip installation meets medical requirements.
The microchip uses the same technology as cat and dog microchips and takes only 30 seconds to install.
Northam's company also changes the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with a microchip. The cost of handling one lock is £300.
Northam is married and has one child, and has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers
The White House's decision last month to fly a naval helicopter to the White House's southern lawn for an event showing American production cost taxpayers $24,000, according to military documents obtained by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is referred to as Marine One when the President is aboard it. It was the main attraction at an event at the White House on 17 July 2017 that showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and a group of White House officials reviewed the products from all 50 states.
In addition to the Connecticut-built helicopter, the exhibits included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office had requested the helicopter's location by mission order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern lawn for an "extraordinary" event, as evidenced by naval HMX-1 helicopter fleet documents.
"I just wanted to make sure you're aware of it, because it's an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility," the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an email to his superior, who is the deputy commander of the Navy Air Force, the day before the incident.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grass field on 17 July at 7 a.m. and the event would begin at 3 p.m. The helicopter would not leave the scene until after the grass field was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The message also stated that if the helicopter was delayed from the White House, another crew would be needed due to service hours restrictions.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the duration of the incident, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents obtained by TIME magazine whether another crew was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 inquired if the incident was a violation of the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told not to," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," the deputy commandant replied.
Made in America was an official White House event, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president spoke out in favor of health care reform, which was then before the Senate, as well as looser state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents must use them on their travels,
But their use only for photographs is unusual.
Trump's actions attracted attention in February when Air Force One rolled into the background of a presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made by American workers from American materials from all 50 states," White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 unit crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and train on the southern lawn to bring the president to the White House within centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 hours that day in "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, there were no other expenses for taxpayers.
Sikorsky's spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the White House's southern lawn.
HMX-1 has no records of flights related to the president's duties, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the event.
According to the Defense Department's 2017 hourly compensation, the VH-3D helicopter has a compensation level of $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico base in the state of Virginia to the White House and back took a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operating the helicopter is clearly lower.
"The calculation of the cost to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staffing, maintenance and many other so-called embedded costs that are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND research company, the compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the incident, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use at the event.
"The idea is to showcase American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and will probably employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard for.
It is entirely appropriate to point that out."
It is not certain if Trump was in the helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat down in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky squadron.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Lightning hit Vaasan track - trains will have to be replaced by buses
Passenger rail services between Seinäjoki and Vaasa are out of service due to a technical fault, reports the Railway Traffic Centre.

Venezuela's state prosecutor demands right to block appointment of new representative of the country
Venezuela's state prosecutor has applied for a court decision that would prevent the country's new Representative Council from being appointed.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the assembly elected last Sunday will be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative body was elected for the country, which can, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega said the blocking decision had been requested due to suspected election fraud.
Ortega has also started an election fraud investigation into the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company that conducted the vote said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only Maduro's allies were nominated for the council, and the 545-member council includes Maduro's son and wife.
In addition to amending the constitution, the Representative Council can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro described as a dictator
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the revision of the constitution as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, on the other hand, have announced that they will not recognise the new Representative Council.
Maduro claims that the new council is the solution to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has been going on for months.
A large number of people have been wounded and more than 100 have died.
Venezuela plunged into an economic crisis after oil prices fell.
Now many people cannot afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to demonstrate on Friday, when the new council is scheduled to start.
Russian man extradited by Finland sentenced to 4 years in prison in US
The Minneapolis court on Thursday sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for his involvement in a global computer scam.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a US demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on holiday in Finland.
He was arrested by the Finnish border authorities when he was returning home.
Finland handed Senah over to U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, the AFP news agency reported.
He was found guilty in March of this year of computer fraud that had generated millions of dollars in profit.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah will be deported after serving a prison sentence.
The Russian Foreign Ministry severely criticised Finland after the arrest and said that the man should not be extradited to the United States.
The statement criticized Finland and the United States for making the arrest in Finland without Russia knowing about it in advance.
Prosecutors say Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The scammers then used the data to further redirect internet traffic, which was used to make click scams and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, acting director of the Justice Department's crime department, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt down cybercriminals operating in other countries.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice," Blanco said in a statement.

Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture, so the Cali Cartel takes the lead in the Netflix hit series
Although the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is definitely not over.
The streaming service has already confirmed that a third and fourth seasons of the series will be shown. The third season trailer has been released, introducing the new villains of the series.
In season three, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the richest drug trafficking organization in the world.
The organization, led by the four godfathers, operates "like a Fortune 500 company", except that there is a little more corruption and violence by the authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) runs the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles the connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal makes a comeback as Javier Peñana, who recruits American and Colombian policemen for the War on Drugs.
New faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola creates an exceptional light art work in Paris
Joensuu-based light artist Kari Kola (in Kuav) will carry out an exceptional light artwork to celebrate the first Light Day set by the UN in Paris next year on May 16.
Kola makes a light art work called Day and Night in Paris.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the UNESCO Headquarters Fontenoy building and the Globe monument in front of it.
With my work, I want to emphasize not only light but also darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I feel are important concretely visible, says light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very honored to be invited to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola participated in the opening ceremony of the Year of Light in 2015, when he illuminated the UNESCO headquarters in honour of the anniversary.
I feel very privileged to be able to re-implement my art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand significantly.
This will be announced later in the autumn, Kola continues.
The goal of International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fight in shopping centre parking garage in Espoo
Two men had a fight in the Iso Omena shopping centre parking garage in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute started when one of the parties accidentally drove in a prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver in the forbidden direction swung at the driver of the other car, resulting in his car starting to hit the batter's car.
He then hit the hood of the car that still crashed.
The man has admitted in a preliminary interview that he caused the damage and did the wrong thing.
Timo Soini's question mark titled article: "After that came the Flood"
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (uv.) published a blog post on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences long.
In my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven MPs' government party.
After that came the Flood, now everything floats," Soini writes.
Soini's text contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the parable of the Flood.
Depending on the interpretation, the phrases "after us the flood" or "after me the flood" have remained in the history books.
UN says Afghan democracy depends on women's political role
The elections will only be representative if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, the head of the UN embassy in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim head of the UN relief mission, said hundreds of women were running for the provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30% of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all aspects of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has made threats of elections at a time when international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's election marks the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women's contributions strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The influx of certain types of tourists a threat to the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
Local outrage is especially directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the destination is only a few hours away and rushes through the sights in large numbers.
Venice is choked by tourists making quick day trips to the city.
It is difficult to move through the narrow streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice can no longer fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historic center while hotels have replaced homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems brought by tourism in Venice.
Authorities are considering restrictions on the number of tourists.
They call the current phenomenon low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you are given two or three hours.
You follow the ticket-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and you turn back, describes the prevailing and trouble-making tourism of the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities lies not only in the architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular places to visit in the historic centre of Venice.
On the edge of the square is St. Mark's Church.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
Only 50,000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venetians demonstrated against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroying the environment and driving out the residents.
About 2,000 residents leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be nothing but tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organised the demonstration.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring to Venice much-needed income and create a need for numerous jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, the solution has been planned for cruisers to go further away from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, believes that the situation would certainly change if the Venetian administrative district, where Venice is also located, was given more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
Venice is visited by about 20-30 million tourists every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the motorway, bad mile-long congestion
The northbound lane on the highway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi has had kilometres of congestion during return traffic from work on Thursday afternoon.
The area is undergoing motorway coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savon Sanomat.
There is a 50-kilometer-per-hour limit on roadworks instead of the usual 120-kilometer-per-hour limit.
Even in the 50 km restriction area, traffic had progressed in some places on Thursday afternoon, however, at a pace practically equal to walking.
Road work progressed on Thursday afternoon on the Siilinjärvi side of the statue of the Apocalypse, or golden deer.
I get along well without that kind of attention.
The 23-year-old runner has had to spot the curses of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has released some great photos of herself in the Grand Canyon scenery, among others.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in her current home country of Norway, not least because she broke a 26-year-old Norwegian record in the 400-meter race in March by lapping the course at 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 400 m hurdles to a Norwegian record of 55.38.
Iuel, a hard-working social media user, soon found that fame and publicity had their downsides.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their genitals to Iuel, apparently in the hope that a young runner would take an interest in them.
Iuel was forced to close his Snapchat account to outsiders.
I got a lot of "stupid pictures" from people I didn't know, so I had to turn my account into a private one," Iuel told VG magazine.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to specify exactly what kind of pictures he received.
You can probably guess, Iuel was laughing.
It's nice to get feedback after a run, but I get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was 12 years old, her family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of her father's job.
It was followed by Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years as a University of Southern California athlete in Los Angeles, from where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed his Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel trains under the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to discussion than the United States.
In the United States, coaches don't ask questions, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal personally with the athlete," Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records in the 400 metres and 400 metres hurdles.
Foot injury put snowboarder Janne Korvi's entire career at risk - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice to not hurt anything"
It has been nice to count now that nothing has happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has been able to enjoy his beloved sport again this season.
As recently as last summer, career continuation was at stake.
The stress injury on the footboard had forced Korvi to the operating table in January, and the foot did not want to get any better.
The hand had also taken a hit on the race slope.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was going to do, whether or not I was going to continue to skate.
Sponsorship deals were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But that's what they say. Things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor extended the contract for two years, and blood began to draw again to the slope.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it the first time I went snowing.
I was like, damn, this is so much fun again, let's go for a couple more seasons.
Korpi didn't get to count properly until September-October, but after a long period of downtime, just training painless has been a big deal.
Only a few races have been toured by Korpi.
It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of rafting for Korve.
I've never counted for one race.
I find it frustrating to aim for four years at one race, and then you're feverish that week.
I can't think like that, Korpi says.
Today Korpi competes in the halfpipe of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races don't keep him on the board, he always catches fire for racing in tough company.
According to Korvi, the value of the races organised by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose the X-Games in Norway, which is held at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, visibility is big.
In my opinion, however, it always depends on the conditions and the level of competition.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Sierra Nevada for Finland's 12-person team.
The team's youngest, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was at that point myself that everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It brings a new flow for itself, Korpi thinks.
I can still keep up on the slope somehow, but otherwise, no, that's how much there is in the flow of guys!
In the background of his surfing career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
Instructor legend Pekka Korvi's son is addicted to trotting: the boarder has his own trotting horses, for which he makes training programs.
When I'm on the road all the time, I don't have time to be in the mess.
But every day I watch at least the race results and usually some departures, Korpi says.
According to Korpi, trotting guidance and trotting coaching are a potential career plan when a career in boarding comes to an end in due course.
I don't mind planning that far ahead, but at least it's a likely option.
I feel like I'm studying it here along with snowboarding.
I try to keep up with the times and develop, maybe in the summer will drive some departures as well.
If that's my future profession, then it won't be hard to start when you're already inside the sport.
The trotting also includes the Elitloppet race cruise with host Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The two have chartered a cruise ship, which will head to Stockholm in late May for the Elitloppet race.
Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has sold well, and people have been excited.
We are now at the point where there will be no bankruptcy.
There are still a few months left, let's hope the ship is full," Korpi says excitedly.
Attendo's nursing home project for Kitee has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of a new 41-seat care home for the elderly to be built on Kitee.
The 1,700-square-foot building is expected to be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre's neighbour Health Road.
A common cause for wonder in the crystal is what customers will be able to do with the new care unit, as many private care homes are now experiencing customer shortages during the Siu Wars.
Anne Flink, Regional Director of Care Services at Attendo, commented that Kitee will be in demand not only for alternatives but also for enhanced service housing in the future.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought the private nursing homes Kanervikkola and Eerika from Kitee.
The deal was about business, but there is reportedly a five-year lease on the properties.
Flink says Attendo does not have an acute need to move functions away from these facilities.
More on this subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's brand's Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the McVitie's cookie manufacturer's executives for their long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to the Scottish section of the General Trade Union of Great Britain, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits and other products, has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, the company that owns the McVitie's brand, said it had invested over £5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives would be "certainly the first to be told" if any changes were to come.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urges the company to "respond to concerns that no funding has been allocated for the modernisation of the production lines."
Drew Duffy, a member of the GMB trade union, finds it extremely worrying that the factory manager does not provide clear information about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have been working here from generation to generation, with a strong focus on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area, a major source of employment in a region of high unemployment and poor livelihoods.
From the perspective of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs, and a continued reduction in production, Eastern Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
According to a spokesperson for Pladis, the factory manager had received the trade union letter only the day before and the company responds directly to the letter because it appreciates constant interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
Among other things, we discussed with our employees that, like other companies operating in highly competitive and uncertain markets, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and locations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to a spokesperson, the company has invested over £5 million in the Tollcross plant in recent years, particularly in its production lines and operational improvements.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production facility and will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make any changes to the operation of the plant."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain won't give up pursuing Neymar after paying £189 million to close the deal, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The sensational transfer is the most talked about case of the summer. The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record for transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half that: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for a transfer of £89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive footballer and also the world's highest paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him a salary of over £500,000 per week after taxes.
Barcelona are known to be outraged by PSG's actions and the way Neymar has forcibly left the club. A source close to Barcelona says that the club has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world of this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced their interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned clubs looking for the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they're after our players, we'll be their opponent and we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're after our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona appear to have done just that: it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose their star player Neymar as a result.
Neste held back the rise of the stock market - Stock exchange news - Ilta-Sanomat
The second major result announcer of the day, Metsä Board, remained on a gentler decline.
The broad European general index Stoxx 600 had risen by 0.1 per cent as Helsinki closed.
The general index of the Helsinki Stock Exchange OMXH rose 0.1 per cent to 9542.08 points.
The OMXH25 of the most traded companies progressed by the same amount.
The total turnover of the stock exchange reached EUR 469 million, of which 67 million was Nokia and 59 million was Neste, the morning earnings announcer.
At the exchange point, Nokia tilted 0.3% to 5.51 euros.
Neste, the next oil refiner, returned 5.1%.
The company's profit before taxes weakened, but exceeded forecasts.
Turnover, in turn, rose above forecasts.

NOW: Calls blasted by Trump were fabricated - White House spokesman: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two phone calls mentioned by U.S. President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times.
Trump's incensed phone calls with both the president of Mexico and the head of the Boy Scouts organization have proven to be fake.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
He said Trump did not lie.
Sanders said many of the scouts' leading figures spoke to Trump personally, and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said Trump had spoken at the G20 summit in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty tough accusation.
Those conversations happened, not just over the phone, but face to face," Sanders said.
Speech to Scouts Raised Disapproval
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president called him and praised Trump for his success in eradicating illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few more will cross Mexico's southern border because they know the trip will stall at the U.S. border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government issued a statement saying that no such call had occurred.
On Tuesday, Politico released the full version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump raved about his speech at a major meeting of the National Scout Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the Boy Scouts leader, he said it was the finest speech they've ever given.
They were very grateful," Trump said.
On Wednesday, the Scout organization announced that it was not aware of any of its executives' calls to Trump.
According to the statement, the organization's director Michael Surbaugh's previous statement, in which he had apologized to the scouts for Trump's speech, speaks for itself.
Trump's speech at the Boy Scouts meeting raised much confusion, as it was extraordinarily political in view of the nature of the event.
Among other things, he praised the results of last autumn's presidential election.
