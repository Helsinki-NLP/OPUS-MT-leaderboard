Changes to business support practices - Province - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will also be concentrated in four ely centres from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Etelä-Savo in Mikkeli is responsible for operations.
Under the new Business Support Act, which came into force in early July, EU Structural Fund aid may no longer be targeted at large companies, unless it is an entirely new activity.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with more than five thousand inhabitants are also counted as large municipalities.
On the other hand, EU support can continue to be granted for investments that improve the conditions for the business life of municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, the strength of the unit managing EU and national subsidies will be approximately 30 people.
For now, at least, they will all continue to work in their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölönen, head of the Structural Funds unit of the ELY Centre in Etelä-Savo, is employed in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now aiming for in Ukraine
Russia acts consistently, even if it doesn't always look that way.
The head of the Department of National Defense Strategy, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren, was not surprised by Monday morning's conflicting Ukraine news.
This has long been the same thing, Siren says.
Elsewhere, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
Elsewhere, Ukraine reports that its paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank detachment near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank detachment has received reinforcements (read more here).
Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire without conditions in Minsk talks.
Russia denies that it is involved and must immediately get the result of the negotiations in order for them to establish themselves in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole plot, Siren says.
This is the big picture: you have to start negotiating quickly and precisely so that Russia gets its own grip on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsources cabin services to a Norwegian company, lays off people
Finnair will start purchasing cabin services from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation as a subcontractor.
The agreement will initially apply to Finnair's Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but is expected to be extended later.
The outsourcing of two routes will result in a reduction of approximately 100 person-years in Finland, which will be implemented in the first phase with layoffs, the company said in a statement.
In addition, about 80 Asian temporary workers will be out of work by the time the routes are outsourced.
Finnair announced in June that it plans to outsource cabin services for approximately 20 routes over the next two years.
Outsourcing was achieved when there was no agreement with the personnel on the savings.
Outsourcing is expected to begin in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, or sciatica pain, in those who do heavy shift work.
A study by the National Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The association of sleep disorders with sciatic wood is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance fitness of firefighters, which are tested regularly, do not seem to protect against pain, says Sirpa Lusa, the head of the study, adjunct professor at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health.
Firefighters work irregular shifts where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Are you familiar with the surprising new causes of water damage?
Easily cause damage to other homes
Water damage is by no means always caused by a leaking pipe or faucet, reminds an expert from the Finnish Hosting Association.
We have been contacted when the breakdown of the aquarium has caused water damage in the housing company, whether it is possible to ban the aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert at the Finnish Hosting Association.
Furuhjelm points out that not only pipes and sewers are common causes of water damage, but also, nowadays, more and more new machines such as ice machines have caused water leaks in homes.
Many people are not aware of the fact that machines such as a washing machine or washing machine must not be left unattended.
Also, the water tap must be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the pipes can lead to a water leak.
A resident may be held guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case liability for damages rests with the resident.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can cover the damage, depending on the terms of the insurance and the case.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused the damage by negligence, the resident is liable.
If a resident has passed out in a shower on a floor drain, the neglect can often be proven, because usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the maintenance worker enters the apartment where the passed out resident can be found.
Furuhjelm says that due to the increasing prevalence of exhaustion on floor drains, many student apartments now have two floor drains installed in the showers.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although not to the extent that they were more popular in the past.
Even a dog's water bowl and a home wine bowl overturning can become a real source of water damage.
I also know of a case where there were many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floors so that extensive damage was done, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of liability for repairs always goes the same way unless otherwise stipulated in the company's articles of association.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material and the damage to the structure of the housing company as well as damage to other apartments.
Water damage easily causes damage to other homes, because concrete in the structure really easily absorbs water.
According to Furuhjelm, housing battery leaks are particularly difficult because the batteries leak easily into structures.
Water damage can be caused by today's generalized air heat pumps, which produce condensate water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or rainwater network, and not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the partner to remove water, snow, ice and debris from the balcony, a legal expert advises.
Furuhjelm instructs that even though the rules of the housing company do not require, for example, a fixed drain hose for the washing machine, there may be a condition in the insurance, which is why compensation is not received.
Be careful with your own home insurance policies.
However, I see the loose drain pipes for washing machines, for example, in the tub, as a big risk, which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the effluents should always be leaked solidly into the sewer system.
Removal of snow and water on the balcony
Control of washing machine, washing machine, etc., while they are on.
Closure of taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
Floor drain cleaning visible twice in six months.
The recommendation is to connect the effluents to the drain permanently.
Checks the faucets and their possible leaks
Regular freezer defrosting

FC Honka lost again and became a serial jumbo
In Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams in the football Veikkausliiga gymnasium met on Sunday evening.
FC Honka, who last celebrated the win in June, hosted Vaasan Palloseura, which sailed seven games in a non-winning pipeline.
The VPS just took their last win against Honka in July.
Sunday's encounter with the Espoo team came at a good seam, as the VPS returned to the winning stock after a long time with 2-1.
Olli Huttunen, the head coach of the Vaasans, complained before the game about his team's inefficiency, but the confused Honka defence eased the VPS' goal scoring problems.
It's a game-likely very nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't hold the ball," Huttunen assessed his own performance.
In the first half, Honga's top two Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played in a very uncertain way.
Both goals were scored by the Vaasans as a result of the loose play of the tops.
The opening goal of the match was seen after only five minutes of play when Steven Morrissey steered Walter Viitala, a Honka goalkeeper who missed Sebastian Strandvall's shot.
I'm sorry for the first half.
By the end of the field, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," Honga's head coach Shefki Kuqi exclaimed.
After the initial shock, the Espoans got their game together and rolled the ball in the attacking end.
In particular, midfielder Carlos Portela and winger Roni Porokara were eager to seek out positions, but the final solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest to scoring was Honga's midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot, however, was slightly past the VPS goal.
The VPS effectively fought back, utilizing their wickety attackers and Honga's cluttered pair of toppers.
At halftime, the Vaasans scored a 2-0 hit when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through the race alone.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was in a good game in the opening period and repeatedly created situations from his left side.
Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for the Espoo defence throughout the game.
"I was screaming at halftime that if you lose, you lose with honor," Kuqi said.
In the second episode, the entrenched Honka was furiously looking for a narrowing goal.
The team was twice close to a hit until the third attempt was successful.
The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty area.
After the goal at Vilaboa, Honga had half an hour to even the match.
The Espoo team took more and more risks, which gave the VPS a chance for dangerous counter-attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey once got to be picky with Viitala, but the Honka goalkeeper's fiery saves kept the home team in the game.
Towards the end, Honka got a little tired and didn't get any more goals.
With the loss, Honka came last in the Veikkausliiga, with seven games left in the series.
Putin says he could take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite harsh in a telephone conversation with Jose Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, reports Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his indignation at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks," La Repubblica said.
According to the newspaper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: There is no point in irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave an interview to Russian TV's number one channel on the crisis in Ukraine on Sunday night.
Putin said in an interview that he considered the conflict to be entirely internal to Ukraine and urged the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev with harsh words about firing on civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't stand by" if people are shot to death at close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: Actor's work destroyed family
The hard work of a veteran actor and a theatre family raised to recognize how the acting profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine turns 70 next Friday, but I think there is a saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year or two or ten years ago.
Mental puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but she still works for a lot of men.
It was sometimes joked that not many plays are made in this country without Esko Roinetta.
Currently, Roine has roles in Helsinki City Theatre's play How to Succeed Effortlessly in Business, Tampere Workers' Theatre's Mind Disappointer and Tampere Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming Risto Rapper movie.
IMAGE: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career didn't start off promisingly.
I wasn't good enough for a Tierna Boy picture at school.
Forty or fifty years later, the teacher said the reason was that I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the business that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army just to get into theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatrical roles and 300 TV shows a bit depending on how you count.
If you count work like Englishmen, that every part of a TV show is its own show, then there are over 600 TV stories.
After all, I was in the New Day for three years, three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed in it when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for Autumn 2016
Esko's older sisters Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing and play the wild roles of anarchist grandmothers in the Tampere Workers' Theatre Still Time.
The little brother will be rocking the stage for years to come.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know at this age.
I always have to make a small reservation to come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
The years have also left their mark on the man.
Age does not come alone.
Knees are operated on, hip whistles and osteoarthritis bothers, but when you don't let it bother you too much, you can get away with it, says Esko Roine.
Roine became known to the TV audience e.g.
From pirate radio and a quiz in which he and Antti Einiö shared hundreds of $100 notes.
It was Antti Einiö who distributed hundreds.
I tried to tell them it was hundreds, not hundreds.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was an unimportant Inspector Iron Rock.
He became a favorite of policemen in Tampere, when he happened to have the same kind of lieutenant working at the department.
A policeman stopped the car in the street, took the window open, and yelled at me, "That Iron Rock is great!"
The working group was successful
The theatre works Roine has been remembered for e.g.
Helsinki City Theatre's Producer and Master Class, Tampere Workers' Theatre's Death of a Salesman and Tampere Theatre's Long Day's Journey into the Night.
It all comes down to the fact that performances have been popular.
It is not my fault, the task force has succeeded.
There have also been rhymes.
Pekka Puupää's role in the film is one such.
There are others.
The reason is that I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the end result is neither for me nor for the viewers.
As a line actor, you don't get to choose your own work.
It's just nice to do what you've been told.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 1980s he ran a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot in Tampere.
It was an educational experience.
It didn't work out at all when I tried to be the administrative director of Tampere Theatre, an actor and then a restaurateur at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it became clear that there was no way to reconcile these.
It was typical that when the show was nearing the end or in the intermission and I was already wondering if I would turn on the sauna, there was a call from the restaurant that there are some friends of yours who hope to see you after the show.
Memories for a Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roineinen will appear in memoirs, with Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen as ghostwriters.
Some sort of concoction they've created from the face-wrestler's recollections.
You know, back when I was playing Zoom, they used to call me a face-wrestler.
I didn't know them by name.
The book has been written for years.
Roine once told me that there is no news bomb in store because he hasn't done anything so violent, or if there is, he won't tell.
I made a small opening sentence for the book.
What I'm saying is that if anyone expects scandal-ridden revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading here.
There are a lot of things there that are professionally related, both as an actor and as a theatre director.
The publisher boasts that there is also a buzz about the hilarious theater school time.
It was a pretty normal student life, but as a kid, you had to do all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as wild as it was in Turka's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much of it I got other than the confidence that once the school is gone, you know it's not going to be up to you if the actions don't get better.
I didn't have to think about how good I'd be if I'd gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen and got to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Halttunen.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was in the same class with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met his first wife Marjukka Halttunen.
As a painful thing, he recalls his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to the mother and the son to me.
I didn't think it was a good solution, and I understand that kids agree quite a bit now as adults.
In theater circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be distributed.
In the case of me, it was part of me that I worked quite a lot even then.
I was in the theater on almost every case.
Then there was television and radio on top of it.
I worked long hours and my family life suffered.
On a holiday maybe a night off
Esko Roine celebrates at the Tampere Workers' Theatre on 7 September.
The celebration will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
There's a mind-numbing buzzer out there, too.
I was 50 at work and 60 at work.
When such an easy-to-move play happened, I thought we'd keep the 70s now, so let's get them off with a bang.
According to Roine, there are no celebrations on her actual birthday.
As I recall, it's a night off, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have booked a gig for that day.
Or it's a strange night off that I'm going to have on the night off," Roine says.
Aviation companies concerned about production chain
Some smaller aircraft manufacturers in the UK are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may derail ambitious plans by large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing production chain are currently enjoying the unexpectedly high number of aircraft and engine development plans being implemented simultaneously.
Aviation and Defence
While some enjoy the backlog of orders, warnings have been issued about the capacity problems and price pressure at hand in the supply chain.
"It's quite true that there is price pressure, especially now that production volume poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, general manager of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, which represents some 240 aircraft production suppliers in the North West of England, more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans correspond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not exactly sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production equipment and machinery needed to realize these production volumes," says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chrurchill, a company that produces wings for gas turbines, the company has a "challenging time" behind it when several new construction plans began to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from a very low production to a state where the production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and we also had to try to move on.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is caused by the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several players in the industry believe that more investment and coordination among small suppliers is needed if the UK is to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation sector after the US.
Geoff Ford, chairman of Ford Aerospace and a fine-mechanics engineer from Tyneside, says that the order backlog should boost producers' confidence and willingness to expand and increase production capacity, as there will be enough work to do.
"If that doesn't happen, we'll lose in the race against other countries," Ford says.
A few major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, an aircraft and engine parts company included in the FTSE 250 index, acquired UPECA, a Malaysia-based aircraft parts company, for £75 million.
MB Aerospace acquired businesses in North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy start-up companies that are creating new operations, but in reality the design limitation and the number of engineers are slowing down the production most," says Gallagher of MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have cited price pressure that has shifted to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of actors in the production chain are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN's aircraft manufacturing unit, who is also a representative of the UK aircraft trade, the chairman of ADS, is of the opinion that the production chain has handled the problem better than in previous seasons.
There is pressure in the supply chain, but I would not describe the situation as critical.
"More important than volume is the introduction of new technology and advanced processes," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are now more careful not to increase the number of buildings too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it ran into great difficulties as the company made a loss and factories and the production chain struggled to survive.
Tony Wood, head of the aircraft manufacturing unit at Rolls Royce, says that the company has yet to face problems in the production chain that supplies most of the 18,000 parts needed to produce the jet engine.
"The road will certainly be bumpy, but we believe we've done more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare to increase operations," Wood says.
According to Boeing CEO James McNerney, the company's supply chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good sense of the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus' passenger jet manufacturing unit, says the company will do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase production of the A350 to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Perhaps one of the journalists will not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation as well as support the journalists and look for alternatives, but there are to expect big problems," Brégier says.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor-in-chief.
This is my job and that of Airbus."
Hong Kong protest groups begin 'era of civil disobedience' as Beijing bans open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Pro-democracy activists are sweeping the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their demands for open elections.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups stress that protests can flare up and vow to ensure that the city begins an "era of civil disobedience" to oppose the Chinese government's proposed electoral reforms.
Thousands of protesters defied the incoming rain against Hong Kong's shimmering horizon as they wandered into a demonstration organized by the pro-democracy Occupy Central group in front of the law enforcement council's premises on Sunday night, where protesters urged people to take part in a large sitting demonstration to paralyze the city's financial district.
The demonstration took place just hours after Beijing announced it would deny voters the right to publicly nominate candidates in the 2017 mayoral election, thus defying months of protests that will further increase the city's division.
The protesters are taking part in the beginning of the Occupy Central protest in front of key government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want a fair and decent election," says 24-year-old website administrator Dion Tse, who participated in Sunday's protest with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yi.
The government has no respect for the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kong people.
China's highest law-making body, the Chinese People's Congress, approved plans for electoral changes allowing only two to three candidates to participate in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, the nomination is subject to the approval of the 1200-member nomination committee, and opposition politicians feel that this effectively prevents the candidate of dissenting political views from being allowed on the ballots.
The protesters take part in a demonstration held in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which took place in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong Government Building.
According to police estimates, more than 2,600 people were currently taking part in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed as about 100 protesters led by a Scholarism student group gathered late Sunday at the Grand Hyatt, where Communist Party member Li Fei was to spend the night after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism, and Federation of Students, among others.
Or, to comply with the law, did not say the exact date on which the blocking of roads will be carried out, but urged the participants to closely monitor the development of the situation "in the next couple of weeks", while adding that the city will officially enter the "era of civil disobedience".
Benny Tai answers questions from the press.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at a demonstration on Sunday, standing in front of a billboard representing two figures in China who were disobedient.
That person will take over the center with you!
Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old convener representing Scholarism, said earlier that preparations for the high school students' demonstrations are underway and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the People's Congress Committee, told reporters that defending "international demands" for universal suffrage is a "waste of time" and comes from some Hong Kong politicians who seek to "mix society and mislead it."
"Unpractical proposals such as public nominations have wasted a lot of time," Li says, insisting that a method of election should be created to fit the actual situation and legislative framework of each society.
A bill on universal suffrage can only be passed if it is supported by a large majority, or two-thirds of the 70-member legislature in Hong Kong, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the bill.
Li warned that Hong Kong could be drawn into a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal is vetoed.
"It would hinder business and the development of the city," he says.
Nearly 800,000 people voted in an informal poll organized by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose China's demands. According to the demands, the candidate needs the approval of the committee.
As many as 172,000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, at the same time as the 17 August march in favour of Beijing and against the Occupy Central movement attracted some 88,000 participants, with estimates from the University of Hong Kong, though estimates by police and organizers differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured in lightning strike at New York beach
In a lightning strike on a New York beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx, on Sunday night as heavy storms swept over the area.
The injured men are hospitalized.
The extent of the injuries is not known.
Lightning struck as heavy thunderstorms swept over the city.
Storms, thunder and lightning interrupted Labor Day weekend celebrations and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Dozens of commercial flights arriving at the city's airports were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not meant to please
This is the latest guide for network users for employees and managers, and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea to recognize in such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If not, the idea is probably popular and self-evident — boring and mundane — or the benefits it brings are so small that it is not worth pursuing.
As a historian, Drew Gilpin of Harvard never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as rector of the university, he repeats the same thing several times to get the message across widely.
Bob Hoffman, an advertising consultant, believes that television and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the web creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading the news online does not mean that the internet is a good medium for advertising — just as the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson notes that one word is enough to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told they were solving the problem in a collaborative way, when in fact they were working alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not told about the collaboration at the beginning.

Mount Stuart hospital cataract surgeries banned due to safety risk
A specialist has been temporarily removed from office, and the NHS, the UK's national health system, stopped directing patients to a cataract surgery in that private hospital after problems with the hospital surfaced.
Two people sought emergency care at Torbay Hospital after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said it was in contact with 19 patients under treatment on July 26 and invited them to an "urgent clinical trial".
The Mount Stuart Hospital apologized and said that the matter has been under investigation since the doctor's dismissal.
The matter came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients who had been treated in Mount Stuart sought emergency care for eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all of whom were examined on the same day, have needed repair surgery.
Torbay Hospital and South Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not referred patients to Mount Stuart for treatment since the problems emerged.
David Sinclair, interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, which runs Torbay Hospital, said that "we've identified the problem early on and were able to contact all the patients involved quickly.
Whenever we refer patients to a service provider, we conduct quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest regulatory requirements and that its permits are in order.
Gill Gant, director of patient safety at the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District, said: "Patient safety is always the absolute number one priority, so it is important that these cataract surgeries are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that treatment is safe."
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, apologized "sincerely to all patients who experienced complications."
The company was informed that "as soon as we learned of the potential problem, we and later Torbay Hospital called all the patients in question."
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered physician since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract surgeries in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of his operations have been excellent, with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily suspended from his post until the matter has been investigated.
What is "4chan"?
Infamous anonymous messaging site first released leaked nude photos of celebrities
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he published the stolen images?
"4chan" was founded in 2003 and is a conversational messaging site that's just as much trashed as it is praised.
The site is divided into several sections, so-called bulletin boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, from video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create a single, continuously used profile, and their posts are not retained.
On the most popular bulletin boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute as newer releases supersede them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere in "4chan".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most famous memes on the web (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of site rules has also led to a lot of questionable or downright criminal content on the site.
The most popular bulletin board on the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed conversations and regularly receives NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content.
This can include tame porn, but also raw and shocking images. An anonymous hacker released stolen images of celebrities specifically on this bulletin board over the weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer drug research and development
The goal of CytRx is to cure cancer — or at least slow it down.
A Los Angeles-based biopharmaceutical company, recently the subject of a controversy over the intensive sale of shares, specializes in the research and development of cancer drugs.
The most promising drug is aldoxorubicin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials with aldoxorubicin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS-associated Kaposi sarcoma, and recurrent glioblastoma or brain tumors.
It's like a guided missile that travels directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body, says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx, a cancer drug called aldoxorubicin.
Aldoxorubicin contains so-called connector technology, which acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also accumulates in tumors, allowing the drug to pass directly to cancer cells.
The compound only donates the drug in an acidic environment, i.e. in cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to be given more and more doses of the cancer medicine.
"It's like a missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on drug development, CytRx does not make a profit.
The company sold shares this year, raising $86 million for operational maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently seeking 400 patients worldwide for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of alternative soft tissue sarcoma treatment.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and adipose tissue.
Alternative treatment is used in the treatment of cancer when the original treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to seek permission for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman says.
The drug could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data released by CytRx from a previous clinical trial in December showed aldoxorubicin to be a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was 'we haven't seen clinical data on how much it differs from the drug itself,'" said Andrew Fein, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which yielded good results.
"A lot of things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of drugs to the mining industry.
"First you invest a lot of money in finding that one gold vein, and you keep investing until you find that gold vein," he says.
Money is spent on research and development for so long that the drug is successfully commercialized.
Several shareholders have sued CytRx because they felt it gave a better picture of their success than reality.
The lawsuits accuse the company of hiring investment relations firm DreamTeam Group, which then allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotechnology company for articles published on sites such as Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the lawsuits, the articles did not reveal that the companies paid commissions to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had removed articles "that were contrary to the practice".
Several articles on the company were also removed from other websites.
Kriegsman declined to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to respond to the lawsuits.
"I don't have the time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who generally seek employment in biotechnology centers such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"In many ways, this is a wilderness from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst magazine's views
The price of shares in CytRx rose to $8.08 on January 10, and then fell to less than $3 in April when accusations of advertising shares came out.
According to Analyst magazine, lawsuits and negative publicity have lowered the price of shares below their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure there's any easy way to bypass this issue as long as the perception is valid."
In the name of the law, a police cameraman was killed in the middle of filming.
The filmmaker of the series, based on true events, was killed on Tuesday evening when he was shot in the middle of a shooting.
A cameraman filmed a shooting between a police patrol in Omaha and a suspect in an armed robbery at a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from the injuries he suffered.
Police said a suspect in an armed robbery was killed in the shooting in addition to the cameraman, according to TMZ.
One of the first reality TV shows to feature in the title of the Law has been airing in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been broadcast on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of the outside factor will take on a crucial role in the court hearing that began today on the Ulvila killing.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal is now hearing the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court returned it to the District Court with new evidence.
It is the intention of the Court of Appeals that the sentence should still be handed down this year.
Auer was released by the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011.
At the time, the court considered the possibility of an outside factor to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening statement, the district attorney Kalle Kulmala gave the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and the factors that exclude the possibility of an outside perpetrator.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether an outside factor has entered the house that has killed Jukka Lahden in the way and in the time described by Anneli Auer.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Kulmala said.
The murder, according to the prosecutor, began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he was leaving home and seeking a divorce.
At some point, we moved to the kitchen, where Lahti held onto Auer and tried to prevent him from leaving.
One of them took the kitchen knife," Kulmala described the events of the night of the murder on Monday.
According to the prosecutor, several factors prove that there was no external factor present.
For example, there are no sounds from the emergency call recording from an outside factor.
Auer's eldest child - the daughter - told the interrogation that she saw the perpetrator when the man exited the fireplace room door.
The 2011 acquittal by the Vaasa Court of Appeal was partly based on the daughter's story.
Prosecutors say the daughter's finding may not be true
"The daughter did not see an outside factor in the parents' bedroom, although she visited there twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecution's new witness is just related to the possibility of an outside perpetrator.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has told about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the daughter only told the hospital that she only saw Lahti's body when she visited the scene of the murder in the fireplace room.
Auer's defence plans to present lines of investigation to the court, the part of which, according to the defence, has not been sufficiently investigated by the police.
When the Vaasa Court of Appeal acquitted Auer three years ago, the court considered the foreign man's DNA found in the halo as one of the references for an outside perpetrator.
The sample later turned out to be DNA from a researcher working in the National Bureau of Investigation's laboratory.
At that time, a mass sample of 700 people was taken for DNA.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative lines of investigation were excluded," defence lawyer Juha Manner said.
Another of the defense's new witnesses tells of a possible outside factor.
The Ulvilan woman told police about a Porilaism man who had confessed to the act, according to the woman.
Police questioned the man in the summer.
The prosecutor made the decision that the porilaism man had nothing to do with the homicide.
The prosecutor made a request for an investigation into the woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman was lying in her report.
One of the new witnesses in the defence is a nurse who was working at the Satakunta Central Hospital the night of the murder.
The District Court of Satakunta sentenced Auer to life imprisonment for murder last December.
According to the judgment of the District Court, the possibility of an outside factor is at war with the Auer children's stories, the emergency centre recording lacks any voices referring to the outside factor, and the time required for the events to take place.
The verdict came in a 2-1 vote.
The minority judge wrote that contradictory evidence in a criminal case must be interpreted in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter's story must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions of the story, she had observed an outside author exiting the door of the fireplace room.
Auer's two eldest children have been summoned to appear before the Court of Appeal.
The daughter was first heard in person last year in the District Court of Satakunta.
Hearing in court, he could no longer recall the events of the night of the murder.
Auer's second-oldest child named his mother the killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy reported hearing the events of the night of the murder behind a closed door.
He also said that Auer was planning to kill him for six months.
As a plaintiff, the boy is under no obligation to make a statement before the Court of Appeal.
The court hearing continues today with a hearing by Anneli Auer.
If necessary, Auer's hearing will continue tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to attend the G20?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him a number one enemy.
Putin is scheduled to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and there is heated debate in Australia over whether or not his entry should be allowed.
Pussy Riot, a punk rock activist group, called on Australia over the weekend to ban Putin from attending the summit, which will be attended by more than 4,000 representatives from the world's most powerful nations.
"We don't think this person has anything to do with the G20 meeting," Maria Alyokhina said to the audience at Sydney's packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the verge of a "perfect war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia", or "new Russia", so do we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said he is "weighing the decision".
According to Mike Callaghan, director of the G20 unit at the Lowy Institute, Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even though the meeting will be held in the country.
"Australia can decide who it lets in, but it's an international meeting," he says.
Just like when New York hosted UN meetings or Washington hosted International Monetary Fund meetings, "it's not the host's job to forbid someone invited to come," Callaghan says.
The previous week, Tony Abbott said he was "weighing the decision" after Russia's reprehensible actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide on its own.
"However, this is an important issue that I will weigh up a lot, and I think other countries will too in the coming weeks," he says.
People are attending an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The event will last for two days and will feature a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest developing economies, home to about two-thirds of the world's population, accounting for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given the dubious task of balancing different interests under great public pressure.
He believes that the prime minister's best course of action is to take advantage of the opportunity to press Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to pursue a very open dialogue and that he will call on President Putin to account for his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to give an account of his actions," Callaghan says.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world expects them to bring up these issues.
Pro-Russian rebels are preparing weapons for an attack on Ukrainian army bases at Donetsk Airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Putin will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says this may not be known until a few days in advance.
This is probably the last thing on Putin's mind.
He hardly states that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
Opposition leader Bill Shorten has "very reservations" about Putin's entry into Australia, but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the prime ministers and foreign ministers to discuss with other states and the G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events following the Malaysian Airlines crash, and in the absence of pity, sense of responsibility, and the ability to cooperate properly with the plane crash, fully and now, with thousands of Russian soldiers swarming along the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians have great reservations about welcoming Putin to Australia.
Germany's business world criticizes 'self-sufficient' Berlin
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become "too confident" and "self-sufficient", as government policies threaten the country's hard-won competitiveness.
Criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government comes at a time when Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing down, raising concerns about whether it will be able to drive economic growth in the stagnant euro area.
Criticism from business leaders is the result of political decisions vehemently opposed by the German business sector, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the lowering of the retirement age of certain long-serving workers to 63.
"I think the biggest threat right now is over-reliance on Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, the world's largest chemical manufacturer, based on sales figures.
The EU economy
He is of this opinion: "Generally speaking, there is a feeling that we are doing well, that we have money to spend, and that unemployment is relatively low.
I think there is a great danger here.
It is clear from the German government's policy that we are not focusing on growth and we are not a favourable environment for companies, but instead we are focusing much more on distributing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of the German Industrial Association BDI, "The situation in Germany is now good.
Over the next ten years, however, every advanced economy will have to change. ...[In Germany], the reform agenda does not make as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment rate has remained low and the budget is almost in balance, and even once-decelerated consumption is on the rise again.
However, the falling GDP in the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% in the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult, and may make quantitative stimulus more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "go from public consumption back to public investment", for example by focusing future consumption increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
Kerber believes that Merkel's government will destroy the fruits of his social democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder's austerity policies in the early 2000s.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, Managing Director of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Businesses, "The situation in Germany remains good compared to other countries.
It is businesses that are to be commended, rather than government policy. . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social assistance and restricting the freedom to run a business is the wrong way to do things.
A leading German investment banker described the situation more bluntly, saying that recent government decisions are a "disaster".
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard for, just to please the voters.
This is my main concern right now," the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to resolve the fundamental weaknesses of the policy, which have caused costs that have been detrimental to the industry's competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher hands-on at music festival after security blocked access to fan
Actress Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, California, where he reportedly got into an argument with a strict security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
A fan of Kutcher tried to approach him backstage at a Stagecoach country music festival in California, after which the situation got out of hand, TMZ reports.
Kutcher was in the VIP lounge when a young woman approached him to greet and shake his hand.
When the 'Men's Halfs' star went to greet the fan, an overzealous security guard intervened and caused a melee.
The actor and security guard got into a scuffle, and Kutcher's friends had to go in between to hold Kutcher off, TMZ reports.
After divorcing his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher dates Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is the star of a former '70s show.
The melee occurred shortly after Angus T. Jones was virtually removed from the regular cast of the hit series after he released a video in which he calls the series "junk" and urges fans not to watch it.

Bacteria in the Baltic Sea killed the holidaymaker
Six people have been sickened by a bacterium from the Caribbean that settled in a popular German tourist destination.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
Bacteria are most effectively spread by more than 20 degrees in brackish waters.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS), told The Local.
Bacteria can be found equally in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
According to the LAGuS, the sick person had been on holiday on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg will have to be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small cut on his leg.
The patient went to the hospital after discovering on the way home that his leg had turned blue.
Doctors noted blood poisoning in the leg caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of the danger," Sonja Bruehl, the wife of the sick man, told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage caused to the patient and his family by blood poisoning could have been avoided if there had been better information available. For example, a holiday destination could have prepared a press release on the matter.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that doctors have been advised to monitor the infection situation early in the summer, but no official announcement was made.
Cool temperatures have made the risk of contracting the bacteria even lower.
"[Monday] test results showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has been significantly reduced," Dr. Will says.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the bacterium that causes cholera, is particularly dangerous if the person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response, such as in people with HIV or diabetes and the elderly.
Men are more at risk than women because estrogen has been found to protect against the pathogen.
If the bacterium gets sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
When the bacteria is in the wound, the probability of dying from the disease is about 25 percent.
V. vulnificus can also be contracted by eating seafood contaminated by it, though Dr. Will says that this is not the case in these cases.
Pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus caused poisoning for the last time in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: Breast removed due to suspected cancer
The 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen performs and works out hard, but has also had to fear for her health.
It is incredible that the radiating Vieno Kekkonen is already 80 years old.
He too is amazed how those years can suddenly be so many.
I haven't really realized I'm this old.
80 years sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
On his birthday, Vieno Kekkonen spends his time with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held for him by the Folk Music and Pensioners' Association in Karttula, where he lived during his childhood.
We were on the Kekkola stage, the same place where my grandfather was born.
I was overwhelmed by the celebration, the birthday hero tells of an occasion where a stage rated at three hundred was filled to the brim with congratulations.
A couple of days later, Muhos gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers following when he was young.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
There are few aspects of his long career that Vieno Kekkonen has not been seen in public.
One thing he has never said in public before: in 2006 he had another breast removed.
I had an unclear finding on my chest at such a point that it was decided to remove it completely.
In the end, it wasn't cancer, which I was happy about.
A new breast was made in the same operation, so it was quite a big operation.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast, in a way, in vain, as it would have been hard to carry information about an unclear finding, and one cannot be left untreated.
I was just so relieved that there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that it is certainly more difficult for younger people to lose their own breast.

The farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The level of discussion about the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of the experts has been swamped with politically purposeful opinions.
During the summer, Helsingin Sanomat and Yle, in particular, have been pushing agriculture's responsibility for nutrient discharges into the Baltic Sea.
In the same breath, rapid action has been called for to curb emissions.
The average farmer appears to be a superior nutrient expert compared to a few environmental scientists and, with their help, to well-informed journalists.
The farmer knows that nutrient leaching cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients has been sown in the field as is harvested with the crop from there.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to an environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilizers and requires strict monitoring and reporting of nutrient balance.
The authorities monitor compliance with the conditions.
Nutrients stored in the field have been leached into the watercourses even after the restrictions on fertilization, but here, too, there has been a clear reduction in emissions for years.
Farmers have the will and readiness to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that it is impossible to reach the zero level.
"If we want to have roughly the same amount of agricultural production as consumption, we just have to accept that this is the case," says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of Environmental Research at MTT (MT 29.8.).
The past summer brought extensive blue-green algae deposits to the Gulf of Finland.
Scientists were quite unanimous that algae received its growth power from the ocean's own phosphorus reserves.
Phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly rooted in agriculture in coastal states in past decades, but that alone does not explain the stocks.
The wastewater treatment of the growing cities on the shores of the Baltic Sea was rampant until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerned wastewater from Greater Helsinki and was not seen as a problem except in terms of the pollution on their own beaches.
Beach pollution was prevented by the construction of a sewage pipeline in the open sea as late as the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of the water directed there has improved over the years.
At one time, nutrients that ended up in the sea would not leave it, even if agriculture were to be completely abolished in Finland.
Yet every summer the blue-green algae debate and the accusations made are always directed at today's agriculture.
The public debate marks the farmer as guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to carry out political passions.
The Greens, led by their chairman, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, are pushing for major changes in environmental standards in agriculture.
As a springboard, Niinistö has used the summer algae debate.
Niinistö has harshly accused the producers' interest group MTK of being old-fashioned and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be a limit to political rhetoric.
Most special projects in water protection are based specifically on cooperation between MTK, farmers and the environmental administration.
Niinistö's offensive genre serves more to fish for urban green sounds than to protect water.
I guess that's the point.
With tough talk, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the task of MTK is to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only money that has been proposed by Ville Niinistö is cuts from other agricultural money.
Abolition of mining tax won't go through: Palmer
Abbott's government's latest attempt to throw the mining tax in the trash seems doomed, as Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without change.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included a rule in the new initiative that could limit employers' increases in mandatory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday to rush through the repeal process in the face of public confusion and the clear indignation of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original repeal bill, which the Senate had made significant changes to in the past, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described as primarily related to taxes, pension contributions, social security, and family welfare.
Originally, it was an initiative aimed at repealing the "failed" mining tax, as well as other decisions such as the low-income pension contribution ($3.6 billion in savings), the earned income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and the school-age children's bonus ($4.7 billion).
Palmer United Party (PUP) leader Clive Palmer did not approve the move.
"The ill-conceived mining tax repeal bill will not be passed in the Senate without a low-income pension contribution, an earned income support bonus, and a bonus for school-age children," he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Shadow Treasury Secretary Chris Bowen accused that the government is trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory guarantee amount for pension contributions, giving the Treasury Secretary all decision-making power.
"This is unprecedented," he told reporters in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay other additions, bringing the Labour Party's target of a 12% guarantee of pension contributions to as much as 2034.
"It is in no way acceptable, and the Labour Party will, of course, resist at all costs," Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Finance Minister the power to decide whether to stop future increases.
Man's body found at Brighton beach
Police in Sussex retrieved the body of an unidentified man before two o'clock in the afternoon, closing the area near the start of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
Police and the coroner are working to determine the conditions under which the body was placed on the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Investigators are going through the missing persons list to see if there is any connection between the missing persons and the body.
Police were not yet able to confirm whether the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to Mexican police, one person was killed by an accidental explosion at the border.
According to police in Piedras Negras, an apparently accidental explosion in a customs building on the border between Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other people.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the chief operating officer of the city's local police station on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press that the woman who died in Sunday's explosion suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion took place in the overnight quarters of customs officials this morning.
The cause of the explosion is currently under investigation, but authorities believe the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border security.
Three Atlantic City casinos to close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos to close this month
Male customer plays at Showboat casino due to close, Atlantic City, N.J., July 29, 2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City, with three casinos handing out their last cards on the table
Three casinos are closing this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neon-lit metropolis, known for its racket of money machines, can no longer count on gaming revenue.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed as Showboat and Revel casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press reported.
There will be more unemployed as Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
The expected closure of three casinos, one of which had only been operational for two years, is the city's latest disaster since the Atlantic Club's story ended just eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25 percent of the city's casino workers, 8,000 people, will be unemployed, the New York Times writes.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, which suffered from a poor economy, the AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained many more competitors as casinos in New York, Delaware, and Pennsylvania chip away a large portion of Atlantic City's once huge casino earnings.
Even Massachusetts, which previously opposed gambling, looks at its share of the money by welcoming three casinos into the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule difficult to accept
According to Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), it is difficult for it to accept the new estimate by the plant supplier Areva that Olkiluoto's third reactor will not be commercially operational until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, Director of the power plant project, this is due to the fact that the construction work is already largely complete and the amount of unfinished work is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen states in the press release that TVO welcomes any initiative to speed up the project.
Areva today delivered to TVO an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which the construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to Areva's press release, the recent delays in the project have mainly been due to approval of the reactor's automation systems, which was received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally scheduled to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is being settled in an arbitral tribunal, where Areva has claimed as much as €2.7 billion in damages from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's claims to be unfounded and demands approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between actors in the energy and water sectors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders gathered in Stockholm today under the 24th International Water Week to call on energy and water players to work together to address the greatest challenges of our time, to ensure adequate water and energy production for an ever-growing population.
The theme for 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and purifying water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two assets are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, Managing Director of the Stockholm International Water Institute, which organised Water Week, said in the opening of Water Week that "the challenges are enormous".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore there is an urgent need for closer cooperation between energy and water actors in order to find solutions that will allow all the peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, winner of this year's Water Week Water Prize, described water as an enabling base for growth that is needed both by society as a whole and by other sectors. Briscoe said that "developing countries face major challenges.
They need to mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that "there is no permanent solution to [the water crisis] anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
During the week, delegates will discuss the ongoing and future work and collaboration of energy and water sector actors during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI of Sweden at a ceremony at Stockholm City Hall on Thursday, September 4.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make sound decisions about water and sustainable development.
Flying Dead Alien Bodies Home in Miami: The Cost of Flying Bodies
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami capsized, and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds before, and this certainly wasn't the last of its kind.
Every year, more than 1,000 Central American immigrants die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.
For the sake of the first city, we are ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that after arriving in the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place to stay: either a refuge, an effort board up, or a place to spend time while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
Migrant-popular cities are home to a disproportionately large number of foreign-born and temporarily resident, where death and repatriation are a constant source of work.
It is estimated that 20 percent of the bodies of those who died in South Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most human remains (HR, a short form of professional jargon for human remains) are flown home from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the industry, about 80 percent of this traffic travels abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in Central and South America, as well as several European countries.

The more migrants immigrate to popular cities, the more they also die there.
Even after death, homecoming has its costs.
Miami is the main airport for American Airlines flights to Latin America, and the figures in the table describe the human remains flown back home by the airline in 2013.
Returning corpses to the home country is not cheap: prices can range from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and general health requirements for the flight and delivery of human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in immigrant-favored cities sometimes organize funeral communities to help with costs, because returning corpses is expensive, the government doesn't help with the process, and the dead are often young people without insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance programs have emerged from such communities once founded by Italians, Jews, and Greeks living in New York City — the first immigrant groups in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino, and Bangladeshi immigrants are now doing the same in several of their favorite cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few expatriates plan to make the immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, foreigners who die in Dubai without a will are subject to Sharia law, even if the laws on inheritance of the deceased's homeland are different.
All property of the deceased will be frozen, after which it will be distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Dublin-based Aer Lingus airline's human remains network (
2013) scale reflects the multicultural demographics of the city and the Irish people.
The airline suspended the service, but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person passes through a city favored by immigrants or lives there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to an immigrant city is an open declaration of the immigrant's way of looking at life, not death.
However, to die in an immigrant city abroad means to make the most powerful and irreversible decisions for the immigrant — decisions about whether to belong to a local or global community, to the universe or to the country, to the short-term or to the eternal.
The Centre Party and the Left Alliance are making a mid-point on inequality
The opposition parties, the Centre Party and the Left Alliance, are planning to make a mid-term question to the government about the livelihoods of low-income people and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate debate on people's livelihood problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
Growing inequality is also visible between different parts of the country as well as within large cities, the parties point out in their press release.
According to the parties, cuts and tax increases in the government budget for next year will target low-income people, such as students, the unemployed and pensioners, the family and ordinary working people, while, for example, food, medicines and housing will continue to rise.
Nearly half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in a statement.
The livelihood problems of working people have also worsened.
The Centre Party and Left Alliance parliamentary groups will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the Finns Party, has already announced that it will leave the intermediate question of police and internal security resources.
Parliament's autumn session begins tomorrow, Tuesday.
New York City's West Indian Day Parade Begins Soon
Caribbean culture is back in the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day Parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and where politicians also see each other and become seen.
The annual parade will be held Monday in Brooklyn.
It exudes traditional pre-fast carnival celebrations, and part of it is the dancers who wear complex, often feathered outfits.
The president of the Brooklyn area, Eric Adams, is this year's festival champion, but there are also plenty of other political faces to look forward to.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and prospective politicians to greet the public a week before the primary.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also included violence in previous years.
Police have said they will try to keep the event safe through additional measures, including monitoring the activities of gangs in the vicinity.
Is it even worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows the rhetorical questions, right?
There's no point in answering that question.
This figure of speech, i.e., a question that is not expected to be answered, but which hints in the direction of a particular answer, seasons up both high-flying speeches and more mundane exchange of words.
The opening words of Ciceron's famous accusation of Catilina are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, will you avail yourself of our patience?"
The same goes for the questions my wife asked me: "Oh, why shouldn't I be allowed to heat a five-day-old chicken for the kids?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference theme is a finer word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open, and the audience is persuaded to accept the question.
The insidious rhetorical question suggests that no sane person could agree with that.
David Williams, author of a 19th-century writing guide to the subject, described the rhetorical question as "words addressed to someone admirably designed to produce a strong sense of truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they present is the impossibility of disagreeing."
The Art of Conjugation
Rhetorical questions can be asked consecutively if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of consecutively asked rhetorical questions designed to express sadness or indignation are called epiplexy.
Job, for example, uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you gain by oppressing me -- ?
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see in the same way that a person sees?
Rhetorical questions can also be found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning in children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is also a so-called hypophora, which is what it is about when a question is asked and answered immediately by yourself.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex monster for all women?
Parru!
True Moses!
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food that the children have eaten and from which they may have become sick?"
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Curiously, a rhetorical question does not usually attempt to persuade, although rhetoric means the art of persuasion.
If you are trying to talk someone out of it instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted or become enraged by someone's stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get another to accept one's own opinion.
If the audience agrees with the statement "And it's not nice when it's so sunny outside?", a rhetorical question will tell you that the speaker is sure of what they're saying, which ties the speaker and the audience better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no dissenting opinions.
By assuming that a consensus has been reached rather than seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question points to the weak point of argumentation.
In newspaper headlines, the rhetorical question is all too often by far the strongest argument possible in a very weak case: "Did aliens build the pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the implied answer.
"Are you thinking what we're thinking?" was the UK Conservative Party's risky campaign slogan in the 2005 general election.
The party lost.
For some, finding such cases has become a hobby, and the so-called QTWAIN questions (known by British journalist John Rentoul as Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions whose answer is no) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition to find the best examples.
The contest was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", sung by pop star Gary Glitter before he was revealed to be a child molester.
The author has also written the book "You Talkin' to Me?"
Researcher: The Age of Federal Compromise May Be Over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal government could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier said in an interview with the Russian channel that getting peace in eastern Ukraine requires discussions about the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
The transformation of Ukraine into a federal state is, according to Saari, a priority of the goals pursued by Russia in a certain way.
Ukraine certainly rightly suspects that Russia would seek to influence Ukraine's domestic politics through it, he says.
If a federal solution is not reached, the other option, from Russia's point of view, could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia would virtually control Luhansk and Donetsk.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the allegations, although pro-Russian rebels themselves have reported that their troops have been fighting "on leave, volunteer Russian soldiers".
Head of Up: An influential task planned for Katainen
Tiilikainen reminds that the job description is new and still taking shape.
According to him, the idea is that Katainen would somehow coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on issues related to competitiveness and employment.
Of course, one of the priorities of the Commission's programme for the new period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen's background, financial expertise and role during the economic crisis give him opportunities for a good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be portfolio-free, meaning that Katainen would not have a directorate-general under his/her own authority.
Instead, Katainen would become a team leader in the field of EU competitiveness and employment, allowing him to have other portfolios related to the sector to coordinate in addition to the portfolio of the Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
In practice, team management could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Soldiers' Mothers, as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and there are currently more than 7,000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have been killed.
According to the organization, the Rostov City Hospital, near the Ukrainian border, is crowded with wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of the soldiers collect their information from the families of the soldiers.
NATO estimates that there are over 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte on his alcohol use: "After a little drink comes a story"
Big Brother Jussi and Andte spent Monday night pondering the life of a BB house.
On Monday evening, Jussi, on the basement side, was pedaling an exercise bike while chatting with Andte, one of the inhabitants of Kartano.
The duo wondered what their actions would look like to viewers of the show.
"You don't know that until you've seen it," Andte said.
According to Jussi, most of the time in a BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible celebrations or tasks make up only a fraction of the life of a BB house.
More like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the manor spent the evening in wet conditions on Wednesday, and alcohol especially got on Andte's talkative side.
Jussi asked Andte if the party had made a man's life in the house more meaningful now that he had been able to talk to these other residents in a little bit.
Take a little drink and there will be a story, Andte admitted.
Watch Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu Reveals Her Body Ideals in We Women
Anna Abreu says in Me Naiset that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she was on a show break.
At the time, Anna, tired of gigging, thought that dieting would give her more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
Anna dreamed a couple of years ago of a body like Victoria's Secret models.
My body ideal was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good and I thought I wanted to lose weight," Anna tells the paper.
After training her body with gigs and music videos, Anna says that she is not a craving trainer, even though she has been named one.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, who is in Timmi condition, works out in the gym and does boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I can lift a certain amount of weight at the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes the pop star gives himself permission to feast.
If I do, I really do.
Sometimes I get an unhealthy overdos, and I don't wonder if there were any more kilos.
I wonder what my body is thinking.
I feel sick if I do something bad to my body.
Terhi Ylimäinen
Anna says she likes her body.
Corporate profit distribution pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Do the directors of Australian listed companies today simply seek to please the large crowd by granting the shareholders' wishes for a greater distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from the boards of directors of companies to the shareholders that the board serves?
The distribution of profits is most important, it was revealed last week at the end of the 2014 reporting period.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-back programs and by sharing more profit have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the flip side of the coin is that capital consumption is declining faster than analysts have predicted, a fact that leads many to question whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and whether there is a sufficient focus on near-term and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance the business by other means.
For example, more funding will be obtained from the cheap stock market.
From the company's point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
However, even if the funds raised from the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that generosity towards shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net result of this wave of purchase programs (and the reversal of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the period of capital decline", during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares small.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of buy-back programs was $3.7 billion and the value of expected, unrealized capital raising programs was $1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to regard the consumption of capital as a profanity in one of the headlines of its report.
While we now have figures confirming that such a trend exists, informal evidence has been around for months.
Glenn Stevens, head of the Australian Central Bank, said it was enough to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "combat spirit" to boost investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future prospects of individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, because slow consumption of capital usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have fallen by an average of 4% over the past two years.
Estimates of free cash flow volumes have increased by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick glance seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of evidence of corporate obedience.
If I got a coin every time the CEO said that the short-term price of a stock isn't important, I'd be... well, the end of the phrase is easy to guess.
Of course, this claim is not true.
CEOs follow stock prices very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
CEOs' short- and long-term bonus packages are determined by the value of the shares, and the position of managers depends on it.
CEOs like to say that some decisions (whether they are acquisitions, increased investment in an organization, or profit sharing) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for a medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted outlook in the investment market.
Therefore, the current gust of conservatism seems to be an acquiescence to short-term goals.
In the opinion of those who assess the cheap stock market and advocate capital saving, this concern does not exist; however, in the reporting period just ended, it was all too clear that the weight was on reducing consumption of future capital, and the most frugal companies were praised.
Major mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the top spot in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also did the same — some because of compulsion and some because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, do investors put pressure on companies to share profits?
According to Hasan Tevfik, a strategist at Credit Suisse, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as profits from other, more traditional fixed-income investment products have decreased when, surprisingly, central banks worldwide have lowered interest rates to bring more money to market.
In this way, investors have been forced into the capital markets to look for profits, and they in turn put pressure on companies to share more profit.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies with uncertain distributions.
Investors would rather have the money right away as more and more investors approach retirement age.
Statistics from the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution was heavily affected by corporate expense cuts and not by revenue growth.
Cases of leaking celebrity nudes look like phishing or e-mail account hacking
Images of Jennifer Lawrence and some sources say the unknown hacker who leaked videos onto the internet amazes information security experts and Apple.
While a hacker has posted lists of female public figures in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of those photographed have stated that their photos are fake while others have said that they were photos removed long ago.
There are a lot of people who have been photographed and have been said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After hacking, the biggest question is which way the attack was carried out.
And were the photos and videos genuine and where were they downloaded from?
The most recent source of images — a shameless and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service — is the least likely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in in-house security teams whose job it is to try to infiltrate the company's own systems on a regular basis.
"Large-scale hacking of Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Nor does the original publisher claim that the claim is true," notes Rik Ferguson, vice president of the Trend Micro's Information Security Research Unit.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hacks involving public figures (as well as hacks involving less famous people every day) is to leak an email address and password, either by guessing or by fishing for information, i.e. by tricking a person into logging in with their data to a genuine-looking site, after which this information is used against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhones to save settings and, above all, back up images when they are transferred to a cloud server.
A user's account can be logged into iCloud by entering their email address and password, after which their photos and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has enabled two-factor authentication, i.e. extra protection against account intrusion, in which case a code is sent to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, comparatively few people use the 2FA feature, either because it is not known, or because it is considered arduous.
Apple is still investigating whether all of the data came from its iCloud service, and if so, how extensively users' accounts were hacked.
The Company has not made a statement at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgot Password" link on Apple's iCloud service by first collecting public figures' email addresses, for example, from another hacked device's address book.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password across multiple services, allowing passwords to be hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's images claims that the images are genuine, but does not say when they were taken.
Winstead said in a tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These pictures were deleted a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a creepy effort.
I sympathise with everyone else affected by the hack," he wrote in a tweet.
However, independent security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought he had removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from a modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in the cloud because there is often no room for a large number of photos taken by the user.
The standard setting for Apple's iPhone is to store images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones store images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer an automated image and data storage service.
"People take and delete photos, but they don't understand that the photos are being downloaded from the account," Cluley told The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Deleted doesn't always mean deleted," he states.
Pictures and videos can be kept for years.
If someone has access to the user's e-mail address and password, they can redownload any photos and videos sent by e-mail.
Images from Apple's service can be downloaded to a Mac, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot that allegedly shows videos and images taken from Windows PC that have not yet been released.
Two-step authentication protects against such hacking because it requires anyone trying to copy an existing account to another device to provide the code sent to the original user's device, usually a mobile phone.
Without the code, access to the account will be blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo offer two-step authentication for the account, but it is not yet known if those public figures used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they are claimed to be in are not genuine.
A spokeswoman for Ariana Grande has said that the photos that Grande is alleged to be in are "completely fake."
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: "Nude pictures supposedly taken of me are FALSE, don't you understand.
Let me break the roots of the rumors right from the start.
Cluley brings up another option.
Because the hackers targeted public figures, their accounts may have been hacked by someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly managed their email.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agencies or some representative is involved," he ponders.
However, these public figures do not use a single publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of the victim of a security attack or helped configure it, and secretly changed the system so that all data can be restored.
This was the case with Christopher Chaney of Florida, who received the nickname "Hollywood hacker", in which a hacker distributed photos from Scarlett Johansson's and Mila Kunis' email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of sneaking into the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in low-cost, and then posted the photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions "were certainly one of the worst invasions of privacy you can imagine."
Chaney also allegedly spied on two people online for over ten years.
According to Cluley, "In Chaney's case, the star email accounts were hacked and changed so that someone would forward their information even after changing the password."
Cluley says that the obsessive activity of hackers breaking into these accounts "reminds of collecting butterflies."
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had come across a list of information and logins for these accounts in services like Dropbox.
Hackers may also have been trying to infiltrate for a long time
or they had access to someone's email account information, such as an address book, and then fished for other people's information.
I don't think it would be a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped by terrorists linked to al-Qaeda in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to have held 44 Fijian peacekeepers in custody, who captured a crossing point in the Golan Heights last week and forced UN troops to surrender.
The peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and their whereabouts are unknown.
In Samoa, ministers attending the United Nations Conference on Small Island Developing States, including Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are extremely concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon at the summit, and he has offered Australian help to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN wherever it can, including by providing intelligence assistance," he told the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We keep very close contact with all of the network's collaborators and friends -- to make sure we can locate them and make sure they're safe.
Bishop has already assured Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
Meanwhile, a group of Filipino peacekeepers held captive in their military barracks were reported to have escaped in a different part of the same disputed area.
The United Nations has been monitoring the Golan Heights since the 1974 ceasefire between Syria and Israel.
Scammers try to steal your money through carbon tax abrogation initiative, warns Australian Competition Authority ACCC
Scammers are taking advantage of a carbon tax repeal initiative to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority's SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on government agencies' over-sounding offers of thousands of dollars in rebates.
The fraudsters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save on the purchase of goods after the carbon tax is repealed and offer him up to $7,000, the warning says.
Scammers may sound very convincing because they have uncovered the victim's personal information, which they take advantage of to try to get their hands on bank information or to try to get the victim to pay the reward.
They discuss current topics to trick the victim.
Scammers use more than just a carbon tax scam to get their hands on money. Their stories are even more sophisticated, and they take advantage of current issues to build a scam around them.
The missing plane on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired the scammers.
ACCC advises that you contact the company using self-studied contact information instead of the contact information provided by the caller if there is the slightest doubt about the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected phone call or email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for cancelling a carbon tax, be on your guard.
If you believe you have been scammed and provided personal information or transferred money to a scammer's account, contact your bank immediately.
If an offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money distributed by the government — it probably is.
Economic messages: Lipponen criticises EU sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticizes the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU in an interview with Taloussanomat.
Russia's focus in politics is to pursue its own interests.
This is not necessarily what the sanctions will do," Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started work as a liquidator of the business operations of the Confederation of Finnish Industries EK in the Arctic.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"It means, for example, that Northern Dimension environmental projects with clear prospects will go on ice," Lipponen says in an interview.
The financial freeze is now hampering cooperation, which Lipponen says could be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic Sea region will continue to be as great as before.
He is currently conducting a study for EK on Finland's Arctic policy and the opportunities for companies in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report looks far ahead, talking about tens of years," he says.
It is rare for a ringed seal to enter shallow water or close to a settlement, says nature pedagogue Vesa Heinonen from the lecture centre of the Ostrobothnian Museum.
In Vaasan Suvilahti, a seal was seen swimming near the beach this Sunday.
According to Heinonen, the ringed seal has probably come to Suvilahti for food.
It's not messed up.
This means that there are fish in the area, Heinonen hints.
According to him, for example, the Sundom Bridge sees seals especially in spring and autumn, which arrive specifically after the fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vaasa sea area.
We see seals on the fronts of the villas in the livery country, he continues.
Norppia lives in the Bothnian Sea and Archipelago Sea, among other places.
South Australian court says murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside a nightclub
Murdered South Australian pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga.
A court hearing has revealed that pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively towards both his partner and security just minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
Lawyers for the manslaughter of Vallelonga asked the lower court in Adelaide to release their client on bail because it was "clearly" self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said the case is not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been released, behind bars until the trial.
"The evidence is that the dead man behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
Then the melee started, resulting in that 40-year-old drunken man -- tore the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, the death was caused by one stroke, which clearly indicates self-defence or the defense of another.
The 25-year-old man has been charged with manslaughter for the time being.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place at approximately 2:25 a.m. on May 4.
He died of his injuries at the Royal Hospital in Adelaide early the next day, leaving friends and pizzeria customers to mourn the "local legend" of One Tree Hill.
Prosecutors said there was no reason for the accused to act, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver "put someone to bed for a few days."
However, the video footage from the security camera now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the deceased was behaving aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his fair share of hard and violent behavior," he says.
On our client's side is both the presumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
Prosecutors opposed the man's release because only one of the three security guards present on the night of the crash had intervened in Vallelonga's conduct.
They said the other security guards didn't think he was threatening because "he was short," and he used the big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid a physical confrontation.
They said that a taxi driver who saw the incident clearly would also testify that Vallelonga was hit "strongly" and had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man arrested until the following week, when she would declare her decision.
Controversial dolphin hunt started in Japan - justified as tradition - Foreign news - Ilta-Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to delay the beginning of a hunt that was widely frowned upon worldwide.
The Japanese city of Taiji started its annual dolphin hunting season again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
There is much opposition from around the world to the hunt, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote bay where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable specimens have been selected from among them to be transported to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also ends up as food.
However, according to local authorities, the start of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
Knowledge of the practice spread to the world in 2009 with a documentary film called The Cove on the subject.
During previous hunting seasons, the hunt has been criticised not only by animal conservationists but also by diplomats.
According to opponents, dolphin meat has a limited market in any case due to its high mercury content.
According to the pro-hunting forces, including the Japanese government, this is a tradition.
Defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
The Dolphin Hunt was already opposed by protests in several countries over the weekend.
According to protesters in Tokyo, the yacht is damaging Japan's reputation around the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some NATO member states uncertain about deploying new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, views are divided on whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring in permanent troops, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russian politics, and it threatens to bring down European security," Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times.
NATO member states are meeting this week, and the military alliance is set to announce its new contingency plan.
The key question in the plan is whether NATO can violate the Conventional Weapons Treaty (TAE) signed in 1990.
In it, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed on how they would deploy armed forces between the Atlantic and the Ural Mountains.
In practice, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself suspended its participation in the treaty in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the treaty.
Due to the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO is considering whether the terms of the agreement still need to be adhered to.
"NATO resources must be available in all NATO countries that need them," Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the British Parliament's Security Committee, told the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest to fly around the world
While other teenagers were learning to drive, Matt Guthmiller was learning to fly.
19-year-old Guthmiller just became the youngest person to fly around the world — and alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A youth in South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries on five continents.
On his trip, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star for his record-breaking flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich puppy just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun".
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the authors of such comments.
Of course I had a lot of fun, but it also involved a lot of work, and I hope that with my record I inspire other people to go out and do great things.
Guthmiller's enthusiasm for flying began at a young age, when he first asked his parents to let him eat in the cafeterias at the airports.
Later, he insisted on taking flying lessons.
My parents let me go on a short 20-dollar 20-minute introductory flight, but I think they thought at the time that my enthusiasm would stop there.
He didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon after made a deal with his parents to give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of having my own car.
In exchange, I could fly airplanes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a pilot's license and two years later he leased a single-plane Beechcraft for solo flying around the world.
A young man studying at MIT College took care of the maintenance of the aircraft himself and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours in the air also meant that he himself needed some extra refueling —
Practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookies altogether during a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both wonderful and frightening.
Air traffic controllers in other countries did not have weather radar to help him navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which of the clouds only reached a little above the plane and which of them reached 45,000 feet and would tear the plane apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The fuel level of the aircraft would not have been higher.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane crashed on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the most difficult part of his trip.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the take-off phase is technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel required for the 16-hour flight.
However, despite the risks and even his fear of heights, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for computer training through Code.org.
He is a coder himself, and started his own business at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's ambitions loom in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but let's see how that goes.
Guthmiller is going to aim high anyway.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchisee is harder than you might think
Lori Joyce was thrilled as fans lined up for her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores across Canada after Canada's W TV channel began airing The Cupcake Girls reality show in 2009.
Enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchisee was not fit for the job.
"My Franchise entrepreneur sat in his car and called me saying 100 potential customers are lining up outside the store ready to buy a cupcake, and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes as it was a huge missed opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the process of selecting franchise partners, starting with an emphasis on leadership skills that match the company's culture rather than baking skills.
"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he's had about a hundred interviews with each of the 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of training, but the employees work in a completely different way in the work environment itself, so the whole process is quite difficult.
Finding the right franchisee is vital to the development of any small business.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow an organization, while a poorly suited leader can cause costly damage to a company.
"I used to think looking for a franchisee was like going on a date, but that's not true at all, there's a lot you can do during dating to get to know each other before you get married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchisee, a binding contract is signed, a security is obtained, and a new store is built.
Entering into a partnership with someone before seeing how a person acts is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the franchisees is similar to a strong marriage as they share common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That's why McLachlan believes that a franchisee should also be careful in choosing a future franchisee before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as relationships: if a date is rude already on a date, imagine what she's like in a marriage?" she says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contractor, as well as to pay attention to the slightest warning signs from either side.
McLachlan adds that franchisees like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but first-time franchisees need to be more careful in choosing their first, most important partners.
New franchisees, on the other hand, need to determine, on the basis of a parent company that is supposedly successful, what kind of challenges they have had to face and what kind of skills the new franchisee will need when facing similar difficulties.
For the first time, franchisees can also ask for the help of a franchisee to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also reminds us that for those who are first time franchisees and entrepreneurs, there is a lot of help available on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process becomes easier later because franchisees learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchisees can give advice and help with the assessment.
"The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (Founder and CEO of Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly in creating the company and franchise system," says Erik Church, Chief Operating Officer of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move 1 and WOW 1.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first franchisees need to choose this idea in mind.
Church is run by 216 franchisees representing all three O2E brands, and is also a Toronto franchise partner of You Move Me.
Chruch's method for finding the right franchise partner is simple.
"One of the confidence tests we use is to ask yourself, 'Would I invite this person to my weekend barbecue?'" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'no', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking with them for solutions to big business challenges."
Church further points out that O2E Brands has to a large extent to thank its franchise structure for its success.
In a corporate organization, managers often see their own position as short-term and the relationship with the lower management level as highly formal, while franchisees enter into a partnership relationship with long-term goals and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The Franchise partnership has many more advantages over the traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense," he says.
It is a partnership, not a relationship between the vice-president and the local operational director.
This type of partnership is more difficult, but if managed well, it produces better results.
Rail Delays Lower Grain Prices in the North of the United States
Delayed train transportation has led to a significant drop in grain prices in the northern central United States, weeks before a huge crop is expected to put the transportation network under new pressure.
Commercial grain silos in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 a bushel — about a dollar less than control prices — primarily because of the cost of securing oncoming rail capacity, traders and farming organizations say.
IN Raw materials
The problems are most acute on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway company's BNSF railroads as well as Canadian Pacific railroad.
The Federal Railroad Supervisor will hold a hearing on service issues on Thursday.
The northern plains have to rely on the railways to transport agricultural products because they are far from river networks.
Delays in train transport increased as the heavy harvest of 2013 was followed by a very cold winter, which caused trains to slow down and shorten.
Some farmers believe that increased crude oil transportation from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale formation has supplanted grain transportation, which is not true, according to the railroad companies.
According to the head of an international grain trading company, the costs of ensuring the use of the train for grain storage and transfer vendors have risen from zero to as much as $2,000 to $2,000 per wagon per year.
Someone has to pay the cost.
"These expenses will be borne by either the farmer or the customer," says the manager of the grain trading company.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that North Dakota's soybean crop will grow by more than a third and spring grain crop by 16 percent.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we're trying to start a new crop off the clean slate, meaning that enough storage space has been drained for the crop and the grain has been sold and moved.
However, we are now starting late due to last year's service problems on the trains.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle this year's harvest transports smoothly.
John Miller, BNSF vice-president responsible for the transport of agricultural products, said the company has reduced the amount of long-distance transport (customer-ordered railcars that have taken more than four days to deliver) from a peak in early April, 16,500, to about two thousand.
"We've moved almost everything from the old crop we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the grain left over from the previous crop.
However, the latest reported speeds for BNSF grain trains were nine percent lower than in the second quarter of last year, a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is "uneven" but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the processing capacity of all kinds of transported products, such as grain peaks.
Canadian Pacific train speeds, which suffered from problems with the second suma, are 11% lower compared to the same time last year, but clearly higher than the much lower speeds of the early part of the year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has said to the Railways Supervisor (Surface Transportation Board) that changes to its railcar ordering system should improve its ability to handle traffic by 15-20% in the coming harvest season.
"Canadian Pacific Railway's action plan for the autumn will focus on continuous improvements in train speed as well as the efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more railcars each week," said a spokesman for the railway company.
Ukraine crisis may solve NATO's 'identity crisis'
Leaders, diplomats and experts from major countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's mission in Afghanistan will mean the end of NATO's importance as well.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident at the NATO summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, which will be attended by 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of crises in the world on the agenda of politicians and diplomats, even to the point that the removal of Afghan troops, which used to be a priority, is no longer the most important thing.
What is needed, instead, is a federation of 28 states following Russia's re-invasion of Ukraine, a shocking reminder that the threat to European independence may not be just a part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defense spending, and re-engage in defense cooperation.
In some ways, NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was in some way looking for its purpose -- and it was going through a rather significant identity crisis," says Heather Conley, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., think tank Europe.
Not only has NATO found a new purpose, but it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy to defeat the rapidly gaining militants of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the president will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his war-weary collaborators to a military response, especially one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world in finding a strategy to defeat Islamic extremists, having first directly stated that "we have no strategy."
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved when discussing Ukraine or the Islamic State.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main means of punishing what Ukraine calls the Russian invasion.
European Union officials discussed the issue over the weekend, but postponed the decision on the new sanctions.
U.S. officials pointed out that the states Obama hopes will be the main partners in the Islamist problem may not be members of NATO.
The accumulation of problems could not be foreseen two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, then-leader Robert M. Gates made his final speech in his position to say that the organization has almost reached the point of "common military insignificance."
U.S. officials constantly complained that other states failed to reach their financial targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defense spending, but only four Member States — Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States — achieved this goal last year.
Now, however, White House officials say they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff promising to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still being discussed late last week, but the White House found that there is a genuine desire in the company this time around as member states discover potential threats in their actual size.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the alliance's "defence pledges are more significant and important than at any time since the end of the Cold War," says Charles Kupchan, president of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach a consensus among the 28 Member States.
Obama will use much of his journey to strengthen his commitment to defense cooperation in favor of Russia's worried neighbors.
The President begins his three-day trip with a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets with leaders from both Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has been recycling its troops in Estonia since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when a new contingency plan, which will be released this week, is introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time NATO needs to respond to attacks on the territory of border states, officials say.
The plan includes the addition of air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation signs.
There is little risk in the changes for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of kindness to Russia.
Officials say the new plan does not actually violate the agreement, but it could also be a semantic breakup, a Western diplomat who did not want his name released during the talks before the official announcement.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin has an effective "winter weapon" - does he use it on Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace up his sleeve on Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops onto Ukrainian soil.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine has tightened, Western nations are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia holds the trump card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main source of energy is Russia.
According to the American authority, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), writes Geysar Gurbanov of Harvard University.
When winter comes to Ukraine within the next four months and the coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country ravaged by conflict, Ukrainians freeze in their homes as the supply of gas from Russia comes to an end.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia's energy giant, will help Putin win the war in the end.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on July 16 due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's overdue debt on gas was already $5.3 billion (about €4 billion) by August 1.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I don't think anyone thinks about it anymore, except Russia," Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier to resolve the issue.
First, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of necessary infrastructure.
To replenish stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and preparations made for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman of Nomura, a Japanese holding company, pointed out last month that Russia's talk of humanitarian intervention and planning for a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will intensify in a matter of months if Russia can sustain separatist activity until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies unless Kiev begins to pay the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow gas imports to continue on a temporary basis.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Yatsenjuk said that Russia plans to halt gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak later said the speeches were untrue.
Russia will do everything in its power to deliver gas to the EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger gets 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes
A Saudi court has upheld a ten-year prison sentence imposed on Raif Badawi, who founded the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The sentence includes an additional 1,000 lashes and a fine of one million rials (approximately EUR 200,000).
The verdict was justified by the fact that he had set up a website that defamed Islam.
The verdict was announced Monday by Suad al-Shamari, the organization's co-founder.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
As early as July 2013, Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but the sentence was appealed and reinstated.
The verdict was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures' Riku Rantala's childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one revolutionary human encounter"
Madventures today released a new book, Explanation of the World - An Adventurer's Explanation of Everything.
We asked Riku Rantala for an explanation of the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also talks about the most significant human encounter of her life.
Riku Rantala, author, journalist, co-founder of Madventures, is a busy man.
A new book has been released today, yesterday there was a movie picnic at Kansalaistori and on Wednesday the second season of Yle Docventures begins.
Since morning, he's been running from place to place.
From Makkari's morning TV to taking the child to a day care centre and from there to a weekly meeting.
A face-to-face interview must be turned into a telephone interview.
Otherwise, there's no time.
In the midst of all the haste, he and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff, have had time to stop and write The Explanation of the World, which is, according to the book's cover text, an adventurer's manual for everything.
Everything, huh?
Wow, that's a lot of promise.
The book explores a number of themes, such as what is our future, why one culture does worse than another, why we are here, and who we really are.
We made use of the interviews we've done over the years.
The book has both professors and artists as experts.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've taken quite a bite out of the book.
What is the main message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and big questions are worth considering, because that is when we do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book's idis is about being good at travel reading, but it's also about getting people to talk and share ideas at home.
The discussion can even lead to action, Riku says.
PICTURE: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the Earth, we are forced to believe that at some point we will be making decisions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, only then can a change take place, Riku philosophizes.
Riku says that according to some studies, Western humanity has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This suggests that when we have enough money and our basic needs are met, we are happy.
Money doesn't add to happiness.
We want to inspire people to discuss what is enough.
The exploitation of our natural resources will not be enough to keep this going for long, Riku says.
You also discussed cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finn?
People are not much different from each other.
Of course, the starting points in terms of education, health care and hygiene are different.
Culturally, the biggest difference is that the importance of the community is much bigger in India for good as well as for bad.
When the West has prospered, people will live more alone.
Isolation from others can lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found the right balance between being communal and being alone, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
Riku has met a lot of different people in the world.
What human encounter is best imprinted in his mind?
It takes place during my childhood when I was with my family on my first bigger trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there working for the United Nations.
I was seven years old and two of my younger siblings were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku primes.
We came home to Finland in a big moving car.
We were driving in war-torn Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the side of the road.
A girl of my age was walking along the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big Mercedes bench with a can of Coke in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age will understand the situation.
It was one of those revolutionary human encounters that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Then Riku "went to the cabbage" that other people must be respected, even if they are much poorer or do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
Even then, Riku realized that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adulthood comes the people encountered in New Guinea.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to their advantage in everything, hardly use money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
Surviving is really hard.
It made me think.
And to think he and Tunna want to get their new book readers, too.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would make people act from warm-hearted lovemaking to conversation or even fist fighting, Riku throws.
This is reported by Kauhajoki newspaper.
The events started when the couple arrived at the station by bus and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi left, a man in the yard threw an object at the back of the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as did the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed the male passenger life-threateningly in the head and hand and left the scene.
The knifeman is a stocky, short-haired man measuring 170 to 175 centimetres.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young blonde pony-tailed woman near the scene.
It is hoped that he will contact the police.
Police are also asking for clues from all those who may have made observations about the events or persons involved in the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday 27 August around 7:50 p.m.
"Hi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the net
The scientific journal PLoS ONE has published an article according to which an international team of researchers has been the first to successfully convey a message directly from the mind to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. in Spanish and Italian "moi".
In the experimental arrangement, the electric brain curve of the sender subject was monitored.
The sender was trained to send bits by either hand or foot movement thinking.
Imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of the hands as one.
This information, encoded in bits, was sent through the web to the recipient person.
The receiver was induced by magnetic stimulation to detect a flash of light for every bit encoded at number one.
The recipient had been taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
The researchers admit that this is still a field of research in its infancy, but believe that computer-assisted telepathic communication will be routine for mankind in the near future.
Sanctions - Punkti - Rural Future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia is at war in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, an action is followed by a reaction, a response.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only bite in the long run.
Iran was not allowed to negotiate its nuclear program until years later.
South Africa's anti-racist government sat still for decades, even though trade had been banned by UN resolutions.
Sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, no high-end electronics or military technology were allowed to be exported to the Soviet Union.
Russia itself has set up barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time the wood pellets were used was to freeze the raw wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the store doesn't cause panic.
When the EU is going to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is essentially a joke.
The Russians like to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The flow of gas from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not to stop importing cheese or exporting vodka.
The greatest disadvantage comes from the limitations of the financial sector.
They will only be effective in the future.
The Russian state cannot operate on the international loan market.
It's supposed to shorten old loans, but it's hard to get a new one.
Although Russia has huge foreign exchange reserves, they do not last forever either.
Russian companies' access to credit is dwindling and money is becoming more expensive.
The banks are not able to finance everyone.
More money needs to be printed or businesses will have payment difficulties.
Bankruptcy is bankruptcy in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia's modernization will stop, as René Nyberg, a Russian expert, wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would once again return to Russia and curl up inwards.
An exceptional free-wrestling event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed the international free wrestling matches held in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
The event, organised by Antonio Inoki, a Japanese wrestler who became a free wrestler, was attended by wrestlers from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free wrestling matches, Taekwondo matches for local athletes were also seen.
According to Inoki, the aim of the event was to bring the contested states closer together through sport and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, politicians hoped for improved relations between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan lifted sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of Japanese kidnappings in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation into those cases.
The last time North Korea saw international free wrestling was in 1995.
SOK will reduce the organization of the consumer goods trade by approximately 110 people.
The co-operation negotiations began in June, when the reduction need was estimated to be no more than 130.
According to the company, overlapping functions have now been dismantled and responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK says that it is seeking clearly better cost-efficiency and synergies between different industries through its actions.
In addition to the economic recession and the decline in consumer demand, the background is the structural change in trade, which has particularly shaken consumer goods trade.
The result of S Group's consumer goods trade has been at a loss for some time.
The negotiations covered all employees and management of SOK's grocery trade, i.e. a total of approximately 530 people.
TURKU SANOS: Some of the self-care drugs behind the counter
According to the paper, there are more drugs coming between prescription drugs and self-tapping drugs that could be obtained without a prescription, but only after advice from a pharmacy employee.
According to the Finnish Pharmacy Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could come under the scope of counseling.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and when the predefined criteria are met, the medicine should be given from behind the counter, says Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Finnish Association of Pharmacies in Turun Sanomat.
There are already a few over-the-counter medicines available in Finland, but requiring advice.
One of these is emergency contraception.
Corruption for a More Detailed Reason
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the low number of bribery cases and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, a working group of the Ministry of Justice will consider whether the Criminal Code would require articles on the trafficking and abuse of influence.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the legal proceedings of Patria's bribery case in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
Trade in influence brought a two-year prison sentence in Slovenia for the former prime minister, but Finnish law does not know a similar criminal title.
The Anti-Corruption Cooperation Network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recently completed survey, bribery is hardly investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now commissioned a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police University College on the vulnerability to corruption in various fields.
Messi suffers from groin injury - Sport - Karjalainen
Argentine national football team captain Lionel Messi will miss Wednesday's national match against Germany.
Messi has a groin injury on the side of the stands, his club Barcelona said on Monday.
Barcelona will keep Messi on the sidelines as a precaution.
Messi injured a groin in Sunday's league game against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he can get replacements for the Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are banned from the first game, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Champions League's cauldron in a match with FC Seoul.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly matches in Abu Dhabi, so the team can prepare for the first semi-final match to be held on September 17.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skip the trip to Korea, but coach Popovic believes in their replacements.
"Of course this is a loss - they've been three very important players in the ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from playing in China for this gesture.
After all, it's a setback, none of the players should be absent, but we didn't have Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever takes over must have worked hard, and I have complete confidence in the entire team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone in the semi-finals.
The Wanderers will also be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from ankle surgery.
The defender of The Socceroos was injured before the start of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in a return match at Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
"He's back in the career and he's recovering well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already practiced outside a couple of times, which is good.
It will be some time before he is completely well, but he will recover well.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has access to world-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also thinks the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the big changes at the end of last season.
"We know that this will certainly help players create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better, both on and off the field.
So we are using the camp for many purposes.
An Elite Hamburger Pays Three Times a Worker's Monthly Salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich households if you happen to be part of the country's elite.
The economy torn apart by opposites is reported by the Financial Times.
In North Korea, the informal market is flourishing perhaps more than ever.
They provide wealthy or frugal ordinary citizens with a luxury that is not used to associate with a dictatorship.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: an entertainment center where a mere ticket costs up to ten months' wages for an ordinary worker.
There's hamburgers here that cost $76.
That's three to five months' salary for a regular working man in the country.
At the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
North Korea's "western market" originated in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, although the prices of supplies can be outrageous at worst.
Yet in the capital, Pyongyang, many have a mobile phone with an ovh of $200.
Part of the reason may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
In his time, the administration has emphasized the importance of technology in the country's heyday.
The book fair in Turku moves from France to Sastamala
The themes of the Turku Book Fair in early October are France and Sastamala.
French literature is represented by authors such as Andrei Makine, Katherine Pancol, Gregoire Delacourt and Michele Lesbre.
The French culture is also told by the correspondent Helena Petäistö, who published her travel work.
At the Sastamala department, you can get to know, among other things, Mr. Hakkarainen's house and the days of Wanha literature.
Among other things, Mauri Kunnas will rise on Estrad.
The novels are told by Anna-Leena Härkönen and Jari Tervo, among others.
The fair is also colored by topical discussions, which include President Sauli Niinistö, writer Sofi Oksanen and MP Jörn Donner (r).
The programme manager of the fair is President Niinistö's spouse Jenni Haukio.
Ormiston House: Stormont Council hopeful about sale
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a 19th-century building in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The council failed to sell the building further, with the building's safety and maintenance costing the council about £400 a day.
The building was recently sold for £1.25 million.
The building will apparently be used as a private residence.
The Council purchased the B-rated building of historical value for £9 million in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the building was purchased, it was resold at a price of £2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist Party suggested that Ormiston House might be suitable for a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the council and the real estate agent remain silent about the identity of the buyer and the selling price.
The weekly security and repair cost of Ormiston House is approximately £3,000.
The building was purchased by the Council from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
Ormiston House had a total security cost of £885,641 by the beginning of this year and a maintenance cost of £371,379.
The price of professional repair and maintenance services was £250,015 and the fees for development and design professionals were £212,466.
The building was formerly owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, the Harland & Wolff company became the owner of the building, selling it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-1970s.
"Inequality grows": Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There is no saving, claims JHL.
Helsinki is preparing a radical reduction in the number of school-specific school attendance assistants.
The deduction would not apply to the child's personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education decided to propose a total of approximately 2.7 million qualifiers from the resources of school assistants.
There are a total of about 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the cuts are realized, they will take effect in the middle of the semester from the beginning of the year.
According to the trade union JHL, the decision will increase inequality.
More and more children are in need of support in learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy to reduce the number of assistants for reasons of savings, because the amount of support for learning is not clearly defined by law.
No savings are guaranteed, on the contrary, the workload of the teaching staff increases.
For schoolchildren, savings bring an even greater risk of falling short of their learning goals, and teachers' coping is also hard, emphasizes Päivi Niemi-Laine, JHL's Executive Director.
The City of Helsinki's plans differentiate schools because small schools and students needing support will no longer have access to assistant resources at all.
The City of Helsinki aims to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is done by school assistants.
However, for the most part, the adaptation measures of the Education Department are aimed at this group.
This will affect all parties involved in the future.
The final decision on the resources will be made by the Helsinki City Council in the autumn, for whom I hope to have the vision and wisdom to look far into the future and act in accordance with their goals, says Niemi-Laine.
Israel takes over land in the West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the Etzion settlement near Bethlehem.
Israel captured nearly 400 hectares of land in the West Bank in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem on Sunday, which may be a sign of Israel's future significant construction in the region, while at the same time defying the Palestinians' request not to build more settlements and defying the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli group "Peace Now", which opposes the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, felt that Sunday's events may have been the largest single invasion of land in the West Bank region in decades and could "dramatically change the situation in the region".
The goal of the Palestinians is to establish their own state on the lands that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to Israeli officials, the political impulse to assess the situation in the land came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they hitchhiked in the area.
In July, Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of being the main perpetrator of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the occupation of the land suggests that it was intended as a form of reparation for the population of the settlement and punishment for the Palestinians.
Near the Jewish settlement of Gevaot, the land in the Etzion settlement of South Jerusalem has now been officially declared "land of the state" as it used to be privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step for Israel to start planning buildings in the area if they wanted to.
However, the mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, Ahmad Lafi, said the land belonged to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff issued orders early Sunday that Israel would take lands containing plantations of olives and other trees in Surif and nearby villages of Al-Jaba'a and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of the youth prompted the Israeli military to carry out a crackdown in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamist group that dominates Gaza, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The ensuing tensions along the Israeli-Gaza border flared up in a 50-day war that ended last week with a ceasefire by Egypt.
The occupation of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli-controlled West Bank and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government that are hampering the wider development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The crisis municipalities in Lapland are usually multi-problem
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, according to a well-being survey conducted by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, reducing the tasks of municipalities by one billion euros is not enough.
Common features of crisis municipalities include weak local government finances, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Asko Suikkanen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and eastern Lapland.
In the survey part of the survey, residents assessed the situation of their municipality quite realistically.
Residents of municipalities that performed well in the study were even pessimistic about the outlook.
Low expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the current everyday life and well-being will be preserved, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time period, people do not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a home, says Suikkanen.
The group of researchers was surprised by the large differences between municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita ranges from a couple of tens to well over 100 euros.
The municipal tax revenue per capita varies from just over two thousand euros in Ranua to 4400 euros in Pelkosenniemi.
According to Suikkanen, the municipalities in Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much central government transfers are made, and what the degree of indebtedness is, is much different even in municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders to returning Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily block the return of Islamist fighters who have left for Iraq and Syria.
This is reported by the BBC, citing government sources.
However, according to the BBC, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to retain their citizenship.
According to a government source, this is one of many suggestions that are being considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised and is due to be presented by Prime Minister David Cameron.
The government is also looking for ways to make it more difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way might be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they could temporarily seize passports of potential fighters at the border.
Britain raised the terror threat to the second highest level on Friday.
Bob Carr welcomes Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor's immediate release from Libyan prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
A spokesman for Secretary of State Bob Carr said that "all is going well" and the International Criminal Court lawyer will be released to Australian authorities tonight, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today," a spokesman told the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for their help and support, the representative said.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before continuing on to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and three of his fellow criminal court lawyers were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintan on June 7 while representing Seif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to Libyan officials, Taylor took documents to Seif that they felt threatened national security.
Senator Carr has gone to great lengths to free Taylor, who, among other things, traveled to Tripoli, the Libyan capital, last month to pursue his cause.
Taylor had not been able to talk to her husband or little daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to make a short phone call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke to Taylor's parents in Brisbane, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya to release her daughter before her young child's third birthday in July.
Three other detained criminal court lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of a conversation between a lawyer released in The Hague and Libyan authorities, "the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for any misunderstanding."
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any mistakes, but has promised to thoroughly investigate the actions of its team after its members return home.
"After the International Criminal Court closes its investigation, it will ensure that anyone who has acted wrongly will be tried in a proper manner," the court said in a statement last month.
The International Criminal Court is calling for a trial of 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
Tripoli said his trial should be local and took the initiative on May 1, in which it declared that it would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
Barcelona saved by young newcomer - ESS.fi
Barcelona took their second victory in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but easily Villarreal did not fall at home.
The blue-reds pushed their heads into Villarreal guard Sergio Asenjo until in the 82nd minute they finally succeeded.
The winning goal was scored by a surprising man: Sandro Ramirez, a 19-year-old striker who made his first appearance in La Liga, had entered the field just 12 minutes earlier.
A young man from Barcelona's second team, who received an invitation to the representative crew, finished up close after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Messi's attempt.
Collectings for Ferguson police mysteriously ended after $433,000 overshoot
Administrators shut down two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the sites raised over $400,000 for police who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity site, which is open to the general public, two separate pages bearing similar names — "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" — have raised $235,750 and $197,620 for the Fergusonian police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site run by a Brown family lawyer had raised $314,099 since Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and a demonstration against nearly-white police forces in Ferguson, mostly populated by blacks, forcing Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations try to decide whether he shot Brown for no reason.
Online collection campaigns have generated some controversy for Wilson's defense, especially after some visitors to the page wrote racist comments in the comment section, which have since been removed.
Both pages apparently stopped accepting donations at about the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators gave no reason for this.
When a visitor tries to make a donation, he sees a message saying "Donations are no longer accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
A spokesperson for GoFundMe on Sunday gave a statement to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organizer decides when they want to stop receiving donations," Kelsea Little, a spokeswoman for GoFundMe, said in a statement.
Organizers may also choose to continue receiving donations at a later date.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197,620, is maintained by the St. Louis Police Department's Shield of Hope, a charity that is a donation recipient approved by GoFundMe.
Three police officers, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, who were registered as official representatives of the Shield of Hope group in the State Collection Register, did not respond to emails on Sunday asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official spokesperson for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missouri House of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately get in touch with the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, which uses the name "Stand Up" and has raised $235,750. He has not been confirmed as a site-approved donor.
However, a GoFundMe spokesperson assured The Times in a statement that there is an anonymous benefactor.
Little information has been given to donors about the anonymous benefactor of the fundraising campaign, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
An anonymous Wilson page benefactor wrote a message to site visitors two weeks ago that the page is collaborating with the Shield of Hope group to be officially accepted as a recipient of donations.
Approval has not yet been given.
The benefactor gave visitors who wanted more information a pseudonymous Gmail email address, but did not respond to a request for more information on Sunday.
A spokesman for GoFundMe said in a statement to The Times that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the main site's search results, adding that "the campaign in question no longer meets the requirements stated by GoFundMe to have a functioning Facebook account."
The GoFundMe website's privacy policies encourage users to "donate only to GoFundMe users they know personally and trust."
Unfortunately, there is no valid guarantee that the contents of the collection page published on GoFundMe are accurate and honest.
However, according to Representative Little, GoFundMe has "been in contact with the campaign organizer and has no reason to doubt his integrity.
GoFundMe is also able to withhold all collected funds if it is necessary to start an investigation in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not found it appropriate to withhold funds raised by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has run campaigns in support of Wilson, told the page's followers over the weekend that lawyers are trying to find an "explanation" as to why GoFundMe's donors have been blocked from donating, but the page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page, and these comments have not been confirmed by an independent source.
Arsenal's top striker for the rest of the year - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
English Premier League Arsenal French striker Olivier Giroud is likely to be on the sidelines until the end of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut off on Wednesday and the recovery will take months.
Giroud injured his leg this weekend in a Premier League game against Everton.
The surgery went well, but he's on the sidelines until he can play at the top level, until the end of December or the beginning of January," Arsenal head coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Giroud was Arsenal's top scorer last season with 16 hits, so the loss is substantial.
However, according to Wenger, he will not necessarily acquire a seat for Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger played fresh pick Alexis Sanchez at the top Wednesday in the Champions League qualifying final against Besiktas.
Arsenal beat Sanchez 1-0 with a goal.
Hollywood celebrities' nude photos circulated online - hacking suspected
The images, allegedly nudes of several public figures, were circulated on social media on Sunday.
The photos included Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence and pop star Rihanna.
According to U.S. media, the images are suspected to have been the subject of extensive hacking.
According to media reports, the photos were stolen from Apple's iCloud cloud accounts.
"It's really weird and tough when privacy is taken away," Lawrence tweeted.
According to the media, the photos also included actress and model Jenny McCarthy, reality TV presenter Kim Kardashian, and singer and actress Avril Lavigne.
According to a spokesperson for actress and pop star Ariana Grande, the photos she is alleged to be in are fake.
That's what singer Victoria Justice said.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in horror films, said that the intimate pictures published about her are years old.
Middle Finns: Finns rely on online banking security
The majority of Finns trust the security of online banks, reports Keskisuomalainen.
According to a survey commissioned by the magazine, four out of five people consider online banking security to be good.
The age of the respondents is clearly shown in the answers.
Young people believe the most in the security of online banks, the least in pensioners.
Tuula Sario, the Consumer Association's leading lawyer, is not surprised by the views.
People who use a lot of the internet tend to trust its services the most.
Those who do not use the services, on the other hand, are ignorant and suspicious, he ponders in the Middle Finn.
The majority of Finns are a customer of an online bank.
It is most commonly done on a computer, but the use of mobile devices is becoming more and more common.
One thousand Finns responded to Tietoykkönen Oy's survey in August.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and the Bridge series scriptwriter to co-author a crime series
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's best-known crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, a scriptwriter for the popular Bridge series, are working together on a new TV series.
Filming for the ten-part Advokaten series is scheduled to begin next year.
Swedish production company Tre Vänner announced the project in a statement on Monday.
The series was purchased by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
Advokaten, based in Stockholm, tells the story of a young lawyer named Frank, who in one case finds dark connections between his own family and notorious criminal groups.
Lapidus, a crime novelist with a reputation for money, is a defense lawyer in his civil profession.
