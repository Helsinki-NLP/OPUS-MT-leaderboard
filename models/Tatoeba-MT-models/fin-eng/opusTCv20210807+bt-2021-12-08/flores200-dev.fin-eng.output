Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine announced on Monday the invention of a new diagnostic tool: a tiny printable chip that sorts cells by type, which can be manufactured with normal inkjet printers at a price of possibly about one US cent per piece.
Leading researchers say it can help detect cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria at an early stage in patients living in low-income countries, where the survival rate of a disease such as breast cancer may be half that of richer countries.

The PBS program has won well over 20 Emmy Awards, with only Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood being shown for longer.
Each episode of the series focused on the theme of a particular book and then explored it through many different stories.
Each program also included recommendations for books that children should look for when going to the library.
John Grant of Buffalo's WNED (Reading Rainbow's Home Station) said, "Reading Rainbow taught kids why it's worth reading, . . . liking reading — [the series] encouraged kids to pick up the book and read."
Some, such as John Grant, believe that both the cut in funding and the change in the programming philosophy of educational television contributed to the ending of the series.
According to meteorologists, the storm, located about 645 miles (1,040 km) west of the Cape Verde Islands, is likely to subside before it can threaten land areas.

Over the past three months, more than 80 detainees were released from Baltimore Central Police Prison without formal charge.
In April of this year, Judge Glynn imposed a temporary ban on the police prison in order to release detainees who had not been heard by the court representatives within 24 hours of their arrest.
A court commissioner can issue a bail and set a bail amount and formalize a charge brought by the authority that made the arrest. The charges are then entered into the state's information system, where records are kept.
The hearing also marks the time when the suspect will be granted the right to a speedy trial.

According to Ansa, "the police were concerned about a few top-level murders that they feared would cause a full war of succession.
The police said Lo Piccolo had gained the upper hand because he had acted as Provenzano's right hand in Palermo and, with greater experience, earned the respect of the senior generation of mafia chiefs as they stayed on Provenzano's line, i.e., kept as low a profile as possible while strengthening their power network.
Provenzano had restrained these mobsters in putting an end to the war against the state power that Riina had promoted and which claimed the lives of anti-Mafia fighters Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992."

Brazil is the world's largest Roman Catholic state, and the Roman Catholic Church has consistently opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country.
The Brazilian National Congress has been debating legalization for ten years, and currently such civil marriages are only legal in Rio Grande do Sul.
The original bill was drafted by Marta Suplicy, former mayor of São Paulo, and the proposed law is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson after the changes.
The protesters hope to collect 1.2 million signatures on the petition and hand it over to the National Congress in November.
When it became apparent that many families had sought legal help to fight eviction, a meeting was held for victims of house fraud at the East Bay Legal Aid Center on March 20.
As tenants began to tell them what had happened to them, most affected families soon realized that Carolyn Wilson, a spokeswoman for the Oakland Housing Agency, had stolen their bail deposits and fled the city.

800 miles of Trans-Alaska oil pipeline was shut down as thousands of barrels of crude oil leaked in Fairbanks, Alaska.
A power outage after a routine fire engineering test caused the safety valves to open, and crude oil leaked out near Fort Greely Pump Station 9.
The opening of the valves allowed the pressure accumulated in the system to be discharged, and the oil flowed into a 55,000-barrel (2.3 million gallon) tank on the platform.
The tank valves continued to leak on Wednesday afternoon, probably due to thermal expansion in the tank.
The second barrier, located below the reservoirs pulling 104,500 barrels, had not yet been filled to the brim.
The comments made on live television marked the first time leading Iranian sources have admitted that the sanctions will have any effect.
They include economic restrictions, as well as the European Union's ban on crude oil exports, which Iran's economy receives 80% of its foreign income from crude oil exports.
In its latest monthly report, OPEC reported that crude oil exports fell to their lowest level in two decades, at 2.8 million barrels a day.
The country's leader, ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has described oil dependence as a "trap" dating back to before the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979, from which the country should liberate itself.

Heck and Johnson already planned, while studying at the University of Wisconsin in 1988, long before the days of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report, for a publication that would parody news — and news reporting.
The Onion has since become a veritable empire of news parodies, including a print magazine, a website with over 5 million individual users in October, dating ads, 24-hour news delivery, podcasts, and a newly launched world map called Our Dumb World.
Al Gore and General Tommy Franks casually list their favorite headlines — Gore's favorite was The Onion's news that he and Tipper enjoyed the best sex of their lives after losing the 2000 presidential election in the number of electors.
Many of its authors have since made significant contributions to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert's news parody programs.

He received positive recognition during his years in Atlanta, and was highly regarded for innovation in the education of urban children.
In 2009 he was awarded the School Director of the Year.
At the time of the award, the test scores of Atlanta schools had improved significantly.
Shortly thereafter, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an article about the problems with the test results.
The article showed that the test results seemed unlikely to improve quickly and suggested that the school found problems with internal audits but failed to respond to them.
Since then, evidence showed that test papers had been forged. Hall and 34 other education officials were convicted in 2013.

Florida is one of the states where the candidate with the most votes gets all of the convention delegates, so all of its fifty delegates went to Romney, who thus garnered an additional neck as the number one contender for the Republican nomination.
According to the organizers of the demonstration, about 100,000 people came to the site in such German cities as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover.
There were 6,500 protesters in Berlin, according to police.
Demonstrations also took place in Paris, Sofia, Vilnius, Valletta, Tallinn, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
In London, some 200 people demonstrated outside the premises of some companies with large amounts of copyright.
Last month, there were major demonstrations in Poland when the country signed the ACTA agreement, which led to the Polish government deciding not to accept the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia have both postponed accession to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are once again calling for surveillance cameras to be installed in all Australian slaughterhouses.
David O'Shannessy, chief inspector of the RSPCA in New South Wales, told ABC that control and inspection of slaughterhouses should be commonplace in Australia.
The use of surveillance cameras would certainly be a clear indication to people working with animals that animal welfare is a priority.
The U.S. Geological Survey's International Earthquake Map did not show any earthquakes in Iceland the previous week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Institute has also not reported earthquakes in the Hekla area in the last two days.
The considerable seismic activity that led to the phase change had been experienced on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano's peak crater.
Dark clouds unrelated to volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds may have caused confusion as to whether the eruption had occurred after all.
Luno had between 120 and 160 cubic meters of fuel when its engine broke and it was pushed into a breakwater by strong winds and waves.
All twelve crew members were rescued by helicopters, and the only personal injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual fertilizer draught, and at first the authorities feared that the load might leak from the ship.
The proposed amendment has already been passed in both rooms of Congress in 2011.
The amendment was made at this legislative session; the second sentence was first removed in the House of Representatives, after which it was passed in the Senate on Monday in a similar form.
Since the second sentence to prevent same-sex civil marriages was rejected, the door may well be open to the acceptance of civil marriages in the future.
At the end of the hearing, HJR-3 will be re-evaluated in the next post-election legislature, either in 2015 or 2016, to keep it on the table.
Vautier's achievements included, in addition to directing, a 1973 hunger strike against censorship he considered political.
He began activism at the age of 15 when he joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He documented himself in his 1998 book.
In the 1960s, he headed back to newly independent Algeria to teach film direction.
Japanese judoka Hitoshi Saito, who won two Olympic gold medals, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was found to be intra-hepatic bile duct cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
At the time of his death, Saito was not only a former Olympic champion and world champion, but also the chairman of the Japan Judo Federation's practice committee.
At least 100 people had attended the party to celebrate the couple's first wedding anniversary last year.
The official wedding anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, officials said.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who has taught at Modern Education and King's Glory prep schools. He claimed to have 9,000 students at the top of his career.
He used words that some parents thought were crude in his labeling, and reportedly he used force words in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large advertisements on buses without permission, as well as lying, after he claimed to be the head trainer of the English language.
He has also been accused of copyright infringement in the past, but was not formally prosecuted.
A former student said he "used slang in class, taught dating skills in notes, and was just like a friend of the students."
In the past 30 years, China has developed a market economy, although the country is officially still a communist state.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90-fold.
Last year, China exported more cars than Germany for the first time and overtook the United States as the largest market in the industry.
Within two decades, China's GDP may be higher than that of the United States.
Tropical Hurricane Danielle, the fourth named storm in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The maximum sustained wind strength of a storm, located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, is 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center have predicted that by Wednesday, Danielle will have strengthened into a hurricane.
Because the storm is far from the coast, its potential impact on the United States or Caribbean islands remains difficult to assess.
Born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, Bobek gained fame by playing for Partiza in Belgrade.
He joined the club in 1945 and remained until 1958.
During his team years, he played in 468 games and scored 403 goals.
No one has played in more Partizan matches or scored more goals than Bobek.
In 1995, he was named the best player in Partizan's history.
The festivities began with a special screening by the world-famous Cirque du Soleil group.
It was followed by Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, Janissary Orchestra and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then came the spinning dervishes.
Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
Finally, the Turkish dance group Anatolian came to present their Trojan show.
13-year-old racing cyclist Peter Lenz has died after a car crash at the Indianapolis Circuit.
Lenz, who was on a warm-up lap, fell off his bike, and was then hit by rival Xavier Zayat.
The medical staff at the track immediately began treating him, and he was taken to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
On the world economic situation, Zapatero further said: "The financial system is part of the economy, an essential part.
We have suffered a year-long financial crisis, the most acute of which was experienced in the last two months, and I believe that the financial markets are now beginning to recover."
Naked News announced last week that it plans to significantly increase its international and multilingual news coverage with three new broadcasts.
News is already available in English and Japanese, but a global company is starting to produce Spanish, Italian and Korean programs for television, network and mobile devices.
Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but the sight was macabre as people tried to break windows to get out.
People hit the windowpanes with chairs, but the glass was unbreakable.
Eventually, one of the screens broke, and people began to get out through the window," Franciszek Kowal, a survivor of the accident.
Stars emit light and heat because energy is generated when hydrogen atoms combine (i.e., fuse) with each other to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to develop a reactor that could produce energy in the same way.
However, the problem is very difficult to solve, and it will be many years before usable fusion reactors begin to be built.
The steel needle floats on top of the water due to surface tension.
Surface tension arises because the water molecules on the surface of the water attract each other much more than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules make an invisible membrane on the surface of the water, which, for example, allows a needle to float on the water.
In a way, the blade of modern skates has two blades with a concave groove between them. Thanks to the two blades, you can get better grip on the ice even when tilting the skate.
Since the lower part of the blade curves slightly, the edge that hits the ice also curves as the blade tilts to either side.
If the skates tilt to the right, the skater will turn to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater will turn to the left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must get rid of the extra energy they received from the light.
They do it by radiating a tiny particle of light called a photon.
Scientists refer to this process as stimulated radiation emission, because bright light stimulates atoms and causes light photon emission, and light is also one type of radiation.
The following image shows how atoms radiate photons. In reality, of course, the photons are much smaller than in the image.
The photons are even smaller than the particles that make up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament finally burns out, and the bulb no longer works.
You have to be careful when you change the lamp.
First, the light switch must be off or the cord disconnected.
This is because electricity flowing to the placenta to which the metal part of the lamp is attached can cause a severe electric shock if you touch the placenta from the inside or the metal stock of the lamp while it is still partially attached to the placenta.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps blood.
The blood leaves the heart in tubes called arteries and returns to the heart in tubes called veins. The smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops teeth would have been able to crush even very strong branches and roots in addition to the leaves.
Some scientists believe that the triceratops ate the pine nuts, which were common plants during the Cretaceous period.
They look like small palm trees with a crown of sharp, prickly leaves.
Triceratops could have used their powerful beak to tear the leaves off before eating the trunk.
Other researchers claim that no dinosaurs are likely to eat these plants because they are very poisonous. Yet even today, sloths and some other animals, such as the parrot (a descendant of dinosaurs), are able to eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you were standing on Io's surface, you'd weigh less than you did on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. That is, of course, the attraction will pull you down less.
Unlike the Earth, the Sun has no crust on which to stand. The whole sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas thins as you move further away from the center of the Sun.
The outermost part of the sun we observe is called the photosphere, which means "ball of light".
About three thousand years later, or in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and discovered that Venus has phases just like the Moon.
The phases occur because only the sun-side side of Venus receives light (the same applies to the Moon). The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that planets orbit the Sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed the transit of Venus.
England had experienced a long period of peace since Danelage had been recaptured.
However, in 991, Ethelred was faced with a Viking fleet that was larger than any since the Guthrum fleet a century earlier.
The fleet was led by Olavi Tryggvenpoika of Norway, whose goal was to free Norway from Danish domination.
After the first military setbacks, Ethelred managed to reconcile with Olav, and he returned to Norway to try to win back his kingdom, with varying degrees of success.
Hangul is the only specially developed alphabet that is in common daily use. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and one of the most respected.
He originally gave the Hangul alphabet the name hunmin jeongeum, which means "right sounds for the teaching of the people".
Several theories have been put forward about Sanskrit descent, one of which concerns the Aryans, who brought their language with them as they migrated from the West to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world is written in the Sanskrit language. After the Upanishads were assembled, Sanskrit faded due to the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has served as a source for many modern languages in India in the same way that Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the Battle of France had ended, Germany began preparing to attack the British Isles.
Germany gave the attack the code name Operation Sea Lion. Most of the heavy armament and equipment of the British Army had been lost during the evacuation of Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
Yet the British Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could have destroyed any offensive fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, the bases of very few British Navy ships were located near likely attack routes because the admirals feared they would sink in a German air raid.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly a "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
Italy's land and naval forces were weaker, although it had recently, just before the start of the war, built four new ships.
Italy's main objectives were in African countries, and in order to conquer them, it needed a springboard for its troops to cross the Mediterranean by ships and invade Africa.
For that reason, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt, and Italian battleships were not supposed to do anything else besides that.
Then Japan. Japan was an island nation, just like Great Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to move underwater and stay there for long periods of time.
The submarines were used in the First and Second World Wars, at that time they were very slow, and their range of weapons was very limited.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly ran on the surface of the sea, but as research began to develop and become more accurate, submarines were forced to move underwater to remain invisible.
The German submarines were called U-boats, and the Germans knew how to sail and use their submarines very skilfully.
Since the Germans used submarines so successfully in the war, many more submarines will not be trusted for their use.
Yes! King Tutankhamen, sometimes called King Tut or Boy King, is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt today.
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not added to most of the ancient lists of kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. Many of the tombs of the past had been looted, but this tomb had remained virtually untouched.
Most of the artifacts buried with Tutankhamun have been well preserved and include thousands of items made of precious metals and gemstones.
The invention of bobbin wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to defeat soldiers and other chariots in speed.
The arrows of the Assyrian deadly crossbows were able to pierce the armor of the opposing soldiers.
Cavalry is an army force that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous figure in the culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: poems called Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular playwrights, and their plays are included among the greatest works of world literature.
Famous Greeks also include the mathematician Pythagoras. He is mostly known for his famous theorem concerning the sides of rectangular triangles.
There are varying estimates of how many people speak Hindi; it is estimated to be the second, third, or fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers depends on whether speakers of very closely related dialects are included.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people are able to understand Hindi.
The Hindi and Urdu vocabulary is similar but the writing system is different. In everyday conversations, speakers of both languages are usually able to understand each other.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia was experiencing Germany's considerable cultural influence.
A few German monks wanted to bring God closer to the indigenous people, and so they invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet, to which one letter was added: Õ/õ.
Over time, many words borrowed from German became embedded in the language, marking the beginning of the Age of Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne passed directly into the army after completing his schooling.
He studied anthropology and archaeology and later history at Cambridge, graduating with a grade of 2:2 (lower second grade).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree.
European Turkey (East Thrace, or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
Turkey's land area is over 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) long and 800 kilometres (500 miles) wide, and is roughly rectangular.
Turkey's area, including lakes, is 783,562 square miles (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square miles (291,773 square miles) is located in southwestern Asia and 23,764 square miles (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is the 37th largest country in the world in terms of surface area and is roughly the same size as parts of France in Europe and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded by the sea in three directions: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it did not become independent until 1839.
Part of present-day Belgium was formerly part of Luxembourg, but passed to Belgium after its revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always sought to remain a neutral country, but was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of an organisation now known as the European Union.
The Drukgyal dzong is a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery in the Highlands of Paro County in the village of Phondey.
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is reported to have established a fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory over the Tibetan and Mongol forces.
Due to a fire in 1951, only some of the relics of the Drukyal dzong remain, for example the image of zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was left in its ruined state and protected, and remains one of Bhutan's most impressive attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was squeezed by its two powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the late 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most working people work in the informal economy.
Two-thirds of working Venezuelans are in the service sector, nearly a quarter are employed by industry and a fifth are employed in agriculture.
Oil is an important industry for Venezuelans; the country is a net exporter of oil, although only 1% work for the oil industry.
In the early years of independence, expertise from Singapore's botanical garden helped transform the island into a true tropical garden city.
Hybridiorkidea vanda miss joaquim was chosen as the national flower of the country in 1981.
Every year, around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate from the northern highlands across the Mara River to the southern plains during the rainy season.
And then through the west back to the north, again across the Mara River, after the rains ended around April.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Conservation Area, and the Masai Mara National Conservation Area in Kenya.
Interactive design requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive courses (picture scripting, sound and image editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires that assumptions about media production be reassessed and learned to think non-linearly.
Interactive design requires that the different aspects of the project are related but also make sense as individual entities.
As a disadvantage of Zoom lenses, the complexity of focal points and the number of lens elements required to achieve focal length scale is much greater than in fixed focal lenses.
This is an increasingly rare problem because lens manufacturers get better quality in lens production.
This allows zoom lenses to produce images of comparable quality to those taken with a fixed focal length lens.
Another drawback of zoom lenses is that the size (speed) of the aperture of the lens is usually smaller.
Therefore, low-cost zoom lenses are difficult to use in dim conditions without flash.
When trying to convert movies to DVD, one of the most common problems is overscanning.
Most televisions are designed to please the general public.
For that reason, everything seen on television has been cut from the edges above and below and from the sides.
This is to ensure that the image fills the entire screen. It is called overscan.
When making a DVD recording, unfortunately, its edges are also likely to be cut, and if the video had subtitles too close to the bottom, they won't show up completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and conjured images of tournaments, banquets and chivalry of Arthur stories.
Just standing amidst a thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-ago battles, almost to hear the humming of hooves on the cobblestones, and smell the fear that rises from the prison caves.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle, typical of its period, is a fortified house rather than an actual castle.
Its large, glazed windows and thin walls could not have endured a determined attack for long.
When Lord Hastings began its construction in the 1480s, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was needed only against small gangs of bandits circling the country.
The balance of power was a system by which European countries sought to maintain the national independence of all European states.
The idea was that all European countries had to work to prevent one nation from becoming too powerful, and thus their governments often changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war whose main reason was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, as the powers of Europe no longer had religious wars as an excuse; therefore, the Thirty Years' War was the last to be called a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC by Herostratus.
According to the story, he was motivated by fame at all costs, and the stunned Ephesians declared that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabon later mentioned the name, and that is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but the offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible, but still press all the keys correctly. Also try not to make a lot of extra movements with your fingers.
This way you will get as tired as possible. Remember that you do not need to press the keys strongly for higher volume like on a piano.
The harmonica gets more volume when using the bellows at higher pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the effort to connect with the highest reality, deity, spiritual reality, or God, to identify with this, or to gain consciousness of this.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or a deeper understanding of divine reality or deity or beings.
Followers practice a certain lifestyle or practices designed to promote such experiences.
Mysticism stands out from other forms of religion and worship in that it emphasizes the direct and personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially those of a beautiful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent, originating in the Punjab region as a sect separated from Hindu tradition in the 15th century.
Sikhs regard their faith as a separate religion from Hinduism, although they recognize its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion gurmat, which is Punjabi and means "the way of the guru". The gurus are a fundamental part of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism their importance is so great that it forms the core of Sikh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by the guru Nanak (1469-1539), followed by nine other gurus.
However, Khrushchev's promises were put to the test in June 1956 when Polish riots, in which workers protested over food shortages and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Władysław Gomułka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, encompassing most of present-day Pakistan and some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the Indus River Valley, where its name originated.
While some researchers believe that civilization should be more aptly called the Indus-Savast culture because it also appeared to have dried up in the Sarasvati River basin, some call it the Harappa culture because its first archaeological finds were made in the Harappa excavations in the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire contributed to the taking of medical advances.
Emperor Augustus began hiring doctors, even forming the first Roman medical corps to be used in the aftermath of the fighting.
Surgeons were familiar with many different tranquilizers, such as morphine extracted from poppy seeds and scopolamine from mad cabbage seeds.
To save patients from gangrene, they became skilled at amputation, as well as using tourniquets and vein clamps to stop bleeding.
Over the course of several centuries, great medical advances were made in the Roman Empire and much of our current knowledge was collected.
There are limitations to the Pureland origami that only one fold can be made at a time, more complex folds, such as reverse folds, are prohibited, and all folds have a straightforward place.
It was developed in the 1970s by John Smith to help inexperienced artists and people with movement limitations.
Children's awareness of races and racial stereotypes develops at a very young age, and such racial stereotypes influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify with a racial minority that is stereotypically failing at school begin to do worse at school after hearing about stereotypes about their race.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites have received a lot of attention, especially in the educational environment.
These websites have their advantages, including the fact that you can easily create your own page for the class, which can include blogs, videos, photos, and other things.
The page can be easily accessed using just one web address, making it easy for students who may have difficulty with keyboard or spelling to remember and write it.
It can be adapted to be as easy to read and as colorful or colorless as desired.
Attention Deficit Disorder is a "neurological syndrome" defined by the classic symptom triangle as impulsivity, easy distraction, and hyperactivity or hyperenergism.
It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disorder that "affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps as many as two million American children."
Children with attention deficit disorder find it difficult to focus on something like schooling, but they are able to focus on things they are stinging at, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoons, or writing punctuated sentences.
These children often get into trouble because they "behave at risk, get into fights, and challenge authorities" to stimulate their brains, as their brains cannot be stimulated by ordinary means.
Attention deficit disorder affects peer relationships because other children do not understand why they behave the way they do or talk the way they talk or why they are at different levels of maturity.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learning changed as mentioned above, the basic level of knowledge acquisition changed.
The approach to acquiring information was different. The pressure was no longer on individual memorization, but the focus was more on the ability to remember text.
Essentially, the Renaissance brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, large anthropoids no longer use their hands to move, hold weight, or move around the trees, swinging themselves.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are the same size and length, suggesting that the hand is reserved for weight in the backhand walk.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, and its finger bones are more straight.
The two to three million-year-old fossils of hand bones reveal a hand in specializing this change from movement to behavior.
Some believe that seeing many artificially induced lucid dreams too often can be very exhausting.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the lengthening of periods between REM stages as a result of lucid sleep.
When there are fewer REM stages during the night, the condition during which the body actually sleeps and recovers becomes so irregular that a problem arises.
It is just as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect depends on how many times a night your brain tries to have a lucid dream.
A week after the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the 11th Hussar Regiment of the British Army had captured the Capuzzo fort in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the commander of the Italian 10th Army's pioneer forces.
Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor-General of Libya and a possible successor to Mussolini, died on 28 June under fire from his own troops when he landed in Tobruk.
Fencing is practiced as a modern sport on many different levels, from university students to professional competitions and the Olympic Games.
The sport is mostly practiced as a duel between one swordsman and another.
Golf is a game in which players use clubs to hit balls in holes.
In the regular round, eighteen holes are played so that players usually start at the first hole of the track and finish at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the least number of strokes to complete the track wins.
The grass around the hole is run shorter, and is called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is the one most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
In it, people leave their own regular daily lives in a very different place to relax and have fun.
Sand beaches, amusement parks and campsites are often the most popular places for recreational tourists.
If the purpose of a visit to a particular place is to get to know its history and culture, then that type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit different destinations in a particular country or they may only focus on one area.
The colonists had also called for reinforcements when they saw this happening.
The advance corps included two hundred men from the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later to become generals).
Stark's men took positions next to the fence at the northern end of the colonists' station.
When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River to the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence northward with a short stone wall that ended by the water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark sank a pole about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered that no one should fire until the British soldiers had passed it.
The American plan relied on the beginning of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder was to launch a diversionary attack against the British garrison in Bordentown to cut off any reinforcements.
General James Erwing would take 700 soldiers across the river at the Trenton Ferry, take over the bridge over Assunpink Creek, and prevent enemy forces from escaping.
The main group of attackers, 2,400 men, would cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one led by Greene and the other by Sullivan, to launch the attack before dawn.
Moving from a quarter mile to a half mile run, the importance of speed is greatly reduced, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class half-mile runner, a man with less than two minutes, must be quite quick, but endurance must also be developed by all means.
The best preparation for the running season is some cross-country running during the winter combined with gym exercises for the upper body.
Proper nutrition practices on their own cannot achieve elite performance, but they can have a significant impact on the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration practices, and understanding the different aspects of dietary supplements can help athletes improve their performance and enjoy sports more.
The medium distance running is a relatively cheap sport, but there are many misconceptions about the few tools required to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may find themselves liking a product more, even though it does not really do any good.
The atom can be considered one of the fundamental components of all matter.
It is a very complex entity and, according to Bohr's simplified model, consists of a central nucleus, which is orbited by electrons in a little bit like planets orbiting the sun (see Figure 1.1).
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, neutrons have no charge, electrons have a negative electrical charge.
Make sure the scene is safe before checking the injured condition.
As you approach an injured person, note his or her posture as well as other obvious signs of danger.
If you hurt yourself while helping, you may only make the situation worse.
The study found that depression, fear, and catastrophizing act as mediators of the relationship between pain and disability in people with lower back pain.
Only those affected by the effects of the disaster were allowed to attend weekly structured sessions of physical activity. Suffering from depression and fear was not a sufficient condition.
Those engaged in regular activities needed more support in terms of negative perception of pain to distinguish chronic pain from the feeling of discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
The sense of sight, or the ability to see, depends on the sense organs or eyes of the visual system.
There are several different structures of the eye, and their complexity varies according to the needs of the organism.
Different structures have different abilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and vary in sharpness. They also need different processing skills to interpret the input seen, and different amounts to work as well as possible.
A population is the total number of organisms in a given species in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical with respect to a particular phenotypic trait, they are called monomorphic.
When individuals show multiple variations of a particular trait, they are polymorphic.
Migratory ant colonies also marched and nested at different stages.
During the migration phase, the wanderer ants march at night and stop at the camp for the day.
The community begins the migration phase when the available food has decreased. During this phase, the community makes temporary nests that change daily.
Each of these trekking battles or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell used by many languages comes from the Latin word "cella", which means small room. It was developed by a microscope user who studied the structure of the cap.
A cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and essential to the study of life that they are often called the building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to keep blood circulation running and undisturbed.
These nerve impulses can be sent really quickly throughout the body, keeping it safe from potential threats.
Tornadoes strike a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything that gets in their way.
Tornadoes uproot trees, remove boards from houses, and throw cars into the sky, with the fiercest 2% of tornadoes lasting more than three hours.
Winds from these giant storms can reach up to 480 kilometers per hour (133 meters per second or 300 miles per hour).
People have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first actual telescopes were made in Europe in the late 16th century.
The telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make the objects appear to be both closer and larger.
There will always be greed and selfishness; cooperation is also characterized by the fact that, when acting in the interests of the majority, in the short term, selfish action produces the most benefit for the individual.
Hopefully, most people will realize that in the long run, their best option is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds, some wonder what can be found there, some believe that there may be aliens or other life on other planets.
If this ever happens, however, it will probably not be for a long time yet. The stars are so far apart that the distance between the "neighbor stars" is trillions of miles.
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand in an unknown world and think about their ancient ancestors.
Animals are made up of many cells, they eat food and digest it inside, most animals are able to move.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals have brains - for example jellyfish do not have brains).
Animals are found in every corner of the world, burrowing into the ground, swimming in the oceans, flying in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism (living being).
In many languages, the origin of the word cell is found in the Latin word cella, which means small room.
If you look at living creatures under a microscope, you will see that they are made up of small squares or balls.
English biologist Robert Hooke saw small squares in the cap as he looked at it under a microscope.
They looked like rooms, he was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can change from one state to another and still not change.
Gaseous nitrogen has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are still the same.
Water is another example. Water is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure as gas, liquid and solid.
Although its physical state may change, its chemical state remains the same.
Time is all around us and affects everything we do, yet it is difficult to understand.
Religion, philosophy, and science practitioners have been studying time for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events that travel from the future through the present to the past.
With time, we also compare the duration of events.
You can see the passage of time yourself by observing how a cyclic event recurs. A cyclic event is one that occurs regularly over and over again.
Today, computers are used to process images and videos.
Advanced animations can be done on a computer, and such animations are increasingly used in television and movies.
Often, music is recorded using sophisticated computers to process sounds and mix sounds together.
The first inhabitants of New Zealand were long believed to have been Maori in the 19th and 20th centuries, hunting giant birds called moa.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori migrated from Polynesia as a so-called large fleet, took over New Zealand from the Moriors, and established an agricultural society.
However, in light of the new evidence, it appears that the Moriors were a group of Maori living on the mainland who emigrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and formed their own peaceful culture there.
There was also another tribe in the Chatham Islands, the Maori who moved out of New Zealand.
They called themselves moriors. There were a few clashes, and eventually the moriors were completely eradicated.
People who had been involved for several decades helped us to appreciate our strengths and passions, while at the same time assessing our difficulties and even failures without covering up.
As we listened to individuals share their own and family and business stories, we gained valuable insights into the past and certain individuals who positively or negatively impacted the culture of the organization.
While understanding one's own history does not require understanding culture, it at least helps people get a sense of their place in the history of the organization.
Individuals and all participants as a whole become more familiar with evaluating successes and becoming more aware of the organization's values, tasks and driving forces.
In this case, remembering past cases of entrepreneurial behavior and the success that followed helped people to be open to new changes and a new direction for the local church.
Such success stories reduced fear of change and created positive perceptions of future changes.
Convergent thought patterns are problem-solving techniques that combine different ideas or fields to find a solution.
At the heart of this mindset are speed, logic, and accuracy, as well as the identification of facts, the re-use of existing technologies, and data collection.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one right answer; think of only two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People who practice this way of thinking think logically, are able to memorize repetitive patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific experiments.
Humans are by far the most gifted species when it comes to reading other people's minds.
In other words, we are able to successfully predict what other people understand, mean, believe, know or want.
In addition to these skills, it is very important to understand other people's intentions, so that we can solve the possible ambiguity of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking a car window, you probably assume they are trying to steal a stranger's car.
His actions need to be assessed differently if he has lost his car keys and is trying to break into his own car.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (while working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause the atoms to emit very small radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a physician and researcher, discovered how magnetic resonance imaging can be used to make medical diagnoses.
The patent was granted four years later, the first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Damadian completed the construction of his first "whole-body" MRI machine, which he named Indomitable, indomitable.
Unsynchronous communication gives time to think and react to others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and manage the pace of instructions received.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints, and flexible working hours are possible (Bremer 1998).
The use of the Internet and online content allows learners to access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to instructors at any time of the day and get relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next meeting face-to-face.
A postmodern approach to learning frees one from absolutes. There is not just one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not even one good thing to learn. Learning is an experience between the learner and the presented knowledge.
Our current experience with all do-it-yourself programs and information-giving, learning-based television shows illustrates the point.
Very many of us find ourselves watching a television program that tells us about a process or experience that we never participate in or utilize this information in.
We never refurbish a car, build a fountain in the backyard, travel to Peru to explore ancient ruins, or renovate a neighbor's house.
Thanks to the subsea fiber-optic connections and broadband satellite to Europe, Greenland is well online, with 93% of the population having access to the Internet.
Your hotel or hosts (if you are staying in a guesthouse or private home) are likely to have WiFi or a computer connected to the Internet, and there is an Internet cafe or a place with a public WiFi network in all settlements.
As mentioned above, although the word Eskimo is still accepted in the United States, many Arctic nations outside the United States, especially in Canada, find it derogatory.
You may be able to hear the natives of Greenland use this word, but foreigners should still avoid using it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves the Inuit in Canada, and in Greenland they use the word kakalalleq (plural kakalallis), a Greenlander.
Crime and bad intentions towards foreigners in general are virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "poor areas".
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that unprepared faces.
If you are visiting Greenland during the cold season (also keeping in mind that its northern parts are the coldest), it is imperative to bring enough warm clothing.
The long days of the summer may cause difficulties in getting adequate sleep and related health problems.
In summer, you should also watch out for mosquitoes. Although they do not carry diseases, they can be annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is linked to its status as a world-class tourist destination, its economy is very diverse.
The largest employers are professional services, administration, finance, trade and tourism.
The city's repeated presence in music, movies, literature and popular culture has made it and its landmarks familiar around the world.
San Francisco has developed a vast tourist infrastructure, including many hotels, restaurants, and state-of-the-art exhibition centers.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to discover other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Traveling to Walt Disney World is an important pilgrimage for many families in the United States.
A typical visit includes a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus ride to a Disney hotel in the amusement park area, a stay of about a week without leaving Disney lands and then returning home.
There are an endless number of different implementation options, but this is what most people mean when they talk about "going to Disney World".
Many of the tickets sold through internet auctions such as eBay or Craigslist are multi-day, multi-park eligible tickets that have already been partially used.
This is done very commonly, but Disney has banned it: tickets cannot be transferred to another person.
Camping below the edge of the Grand Canyon requires a camping permit.
The number of permits is limited to protect the canyon and will become available on the first day of the month four months before the start month.
In other words, a camping permit for the start date in May will be available on January 1.
Places in the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel campground next to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled as early as the first day they open for reservations.
A limited number of permits are reserved for arrivals without reservation, which are issued in the order of arrival.
Travelling to South Africa by car is a great way to see the beauty of the whole region and get to places beyond the usual tourist routes.
It can be done with a regular car if the trip has been carefully planned, but four-wheel drive is highly recommended, and many destinations are only accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle with high ground clearance.
Remember when planning a trip that while the situation in South Africa is stable, not all of the neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and expenses vary between countries, and your home country will have an impact.
Each country also has its own laws on what mandatory equipment should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in western Zimbabwe. Livingstone is across the border in Zambia, and Botswana is also nearby.
The city is located right next to the falls, and they are the main attraction. Yet the popular tourist destination offers adventurous and sightseeing enthusiasts plenty of opportunities for a longer stay.
During the rainy season (November to March), the amount of water is higher and the falls look more dramatic.
You will definitely get wet if you cross a bridge or walk along winding paths near the falls.
On the other hand, you still don't see the falls yourself - all that water prevents!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of all the tombs in the valley, the place where Howard Carter in 1922 discovered the young Pharaoh's almost intact royal tomb.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is barely worth visiting because it is much smaller and less decorated.
Anyone who wants to see traces of the damage done to the mummy when trying to take it out of its coffin will be disappointed because only its head and shoulders are visible.
The great riches of the tomb are no longer in their former place, but have been taken to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited time should spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built at the end of the 8th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The hazy atmosphere of the temple and the view over Lake Tonle Sap make it worth the effort to climb the hill.
The trip to the place can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake.
An Angkor passport is required to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your own country's passport when heading to Tonle Sap Lake.
Jerusalem is the capital and largest city of Israel, although it is not recognized as the capital of Israel by most other countries and the United Nations.
The ancient city of the Judean hills has a fascinating history that has continued for thousands of years.
The city is sacred to three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.
Because of its religious significance, and especially because of the many sights in the Old City, Jerusalem is one of Israel's most important tourist destinations.
There are many historical, archaeological and cultural sites in Jerusalem, as well as shopping malls, cafes and restaurants full of life and people.
Ecuador insists that Cuban citizens have received an invitation letter before arriving in Ecuador through international airports or ground checkpoints.
Ecuador's Foreign Ministry must legalize the letter, and it must meet certain requirements.
The requirements are intended to make the migration flow between countries systematic.
Cuban citizens with a U.S. work and residence permit must visit the Ecuadorian consulate in order to be exempt from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the trip. A return ticket or a connecting ticket is required to prove the length of the stay.
Sightseeing tours are cheaper for large groups, so if you are travelling alone or with just one friend, try to get to know other people and form a group of 4-6 people for a better individual price.
However, you probably don't have to worry about this, as travelers are often moved from one car to another to fill all the seats.
It seems more like a way of tricking people into believing that they have to pay more.
Above the northern part of Machu Picchu rises this steep mountain, which is often seen in the background of photographs taken from the ruins.
It looks a little daunting from below, and the climb is steep and difficult, but those in reasonably good condition should get through it in about 45 minutes.
The path is mostly covered with stone steps, and at steeper points is supported by a railing made of steel wire.
Nevertheless, you can expect to get out of breath, and on steeper stretches, you should be careful, especially in wet weather, because the path can quickly become dangerous.
There's a small cave near the summit that you have to go through, it's quite shallow and quite cramped.
The sites and fauna of the Galapagos Islands are best seen by boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships operate in the waters of the Galapagos Islands, ranging in size from eight to 100 passengers.
Most people reserve their seats well in advance (since the ships are usually full during peak season).
Make sure the clerk through whom you make the booking is a Galapagos expert who knows a lot about different types of ships.
This will ensure that you find the vessel that best suits your interests and/or limitations.
Before the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas, and the indigenous Araucanians (mapuchet) inhabited central and southern Chile.
The Mapuche were also one of America's last independent indigenous peoples and had not been fully subjugated to Spanish-speaking rule until the independence of Chile.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (for a few years during the Napoleonic Wars, which left Spain without a functioning central government), the final victory over Spain was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic (Spanish: República Dominicana) is a Caribbean country that forms the eastern side of the island of Hispaniola that it shares with Haiti.
Along with white sandy beaches and mountain scenery, the country has the oldest European city in America, which is now part of Santo Domingo.
The Tainos and the Caribs were the first inhabitants of the island. The Caribs were an Arawak-speaking people who had come to the island about 10,000 BC.
Spanish invaders had significantly reduced the population of the tainas within just a few years of the arrival of European explorers
According to the Dominican brother Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taino between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Unión. The farm was built as an atrium in a 17th-century monastery, whose only remaining building is the Templo de San Diego.
It now serves as a central square, and there is always a lot of hustle and bustle around the clock.
Several restaurants surround the garden, and free concerts are held in the main gazebo on several afternoons and evenings.
Callejon del Beso (The Alley of the Kiss). An old love tale is told about two balconies, only 69 centimeters apart.
The children tell the whole story in exchange for a few coins.
Bowen Island is a popular day and weekend excursion destination with kayak rowing, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
The authentic community is located on Howensalme, just outside Vancouver, and is easily accessible by regular water taxis departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like outdoor activities, a trip to the mountains along the Sea-to-Sky Corridor is an absolute must.
Whistler (an hour and a half drive from Vancouver) is expensive but famous thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter you can enjoy some of the best skiing conditions in North America and in summer you can try genuine mountain biking.
Permits must be booked in advance. A permit is required to stay at Sirena.
Sirena is the only park ranger station where, in addition to camping, accommodation in dormitories and warm meals are provided. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without food services.
Park permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez Forestry Centre, but you cannot pay with a credit card there.
The Park Service (MINAE) issues park permits up to one month before the intended time of arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service at a cost of US$30 or day tickets at a price of US$10. More detailed information can be found on its Corcovado page.
Cook Islands is an island nation in Polynesia, in the South Pacific, an Associated State of New Zealand.
It is an archipelago with 15 islands in an ocean area of more than 2.2 million square kilometers.
Because the islands are in the same time zone as Hawaii, they are sometimes called Hawaii in the Southern Hemisphere.
Although smaller than Hawaii, they bring to mind Hawaii for some elderly visitors before it became a state and, above all, major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands do not have a single city, but consist of fifteen different islands. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In today's developed countries, the provision of luxury breakfast accommodation has been turned into some form of art.
Of course, the best bed and breakfast establishments compete mainly in two main areas: accommodation and breakfast.
So, at best, such places may have really luxurious sleeping conditions, for example, a handmade blanket or an antique bed.
Breakfast may include seasonal delicacies or a host's bravure.
The milieu can be an old historic building with antique furniture, trimmed lawns and swimming pools.
Getting into your own car and going on a long trip naturally attracts you in all its simplicity.
You are probably already familiar with driving your own car, and you know its limitations, unlike large vehicles.
Setting up a tent in a private area or in a city of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.
In short, your own car is suitable for car travel, but less often it can be used for actual camping.
Car camping is possible if you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan or station wagon with horizontal benches.
Some of the hotels date back to the golden age of steam trains and ocean liners, the 19th or early 20th century, before World War II.
The rich and famous people of their time stayed at these hotels and often served gourmet food and nightlife.
The old-fashioned framework, the lack of the most modern comforts, and a certain dignified age are also part of their nature.
They are usually privately owned, but at times guest heads of state and other notables are accommodated.
A traveler with heaps of money might consider a round-the-world flight, punctuated by visits to several of these hotels.
The Hospitality Network is an organization that connects tourists with local residents in the cities they plan to visit.
Such a network can usually only be joined by filling out an online form, although some networks offer or require additional confirmation.
The list of available hosts is then arranged on paper and/or online, and sometimes includes recommendations and reviews from other travelers.
CouchSurfing was founded in January 2004 when computer programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland but had no place to stay.
He emailed the students of the local university and received a huge number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are mainly for young tourists — a typical guest is in their twenties — but you can often find older tourists in them as well.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels welcome them in private rooms.
The Chinese city of Beijing will host the Winter Olympics in 2022, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Opening and graduation ceremonies and indoor ice events are held in Beijing.
Other skiing events will be held in the Taizicheng ski area of Zhangjiakou, which is located about 220 kilometers (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples hold an annual festival between the end of November and mid-May, depending on each temple's own annual calendar.
Most temple festivals are held as part of its anniversary, in honor of the birthday of the supreme deity of the temple, or in connection with any other important event associated with the temple.
It is really interesting to watch the Kerala temple festivals because they include elephants decorated as a regular procession, a temple orchestra and other celebrations.
The World Exhibition (sometimes also Expo) is a major international art and science event.
Participating countries organise artistic and educational exhibitions in their national pavilions that raise global issues or the culture and history of their own country.
International garden exhibitions are specialized events that highlight floral arrangements, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants.
Although in theory they can be held every year (as long as they are held in different countries), in practice this is not the case.
Such events usually last from three to six months and take place in areas of at least 50 hectares.
Several different types of film have been used over the years. Ordinary 35 mm film (36 × 24 mm in negative) is by far the most common.
New is usually easily replaced if it runs out, and its image resolution is somewhat comparable to current digital SLRs.
Some medium-sized film cameras use a 6 × 6 cm image size, more specifically a 56 × 56 mm negative.
As a result, the resolution is almost four times that of the 35 mm negative (3,136 mm2 vs. 864).
Wild animals are one of the most challenging subjects for a photographer, and successfully photographing them requires good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Shooting wild animals is often taken for granted, but, as with photography in general, one image is worth a thousand words.
Long-range lenses are often needed to photograph wild animals, but other lenses are needed to photograph some objects, such as flocks of birds and tiny animals.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and parks sometimes have rules about taking pictures for commercial purposes.
Wild animals may be either timid or aggressive; the environment may be cold, hot, or otherwise unpleasant.
More than 5,000 different languages are spoken worldwide, with more than twenty having at least 50 million speakers.
Similarly, the printed word is often easier to understand than the spoken word; this is especially true for street addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce intelligibly.
Many whole nations speak English perfectly fluently, and even more can be expected to have at least limited skills — especially among young people.
Imagine, for example, a Manchester, Boston, Jamaican, and Sydney dining at a table in a restaurant in Toronto.
They entertain each other with stories about their home towns and tell them with their own accents and local slang.
Buying food in a supermarket is usually the cheapest way to get nourished. However, without cooking options, options are limited to ready-made food.
The range of ready meals in supermarkets is becoming increasingly diverse, some even offering a microwave or other ways to heat food.
Some countries or trade types have at least one restaurant, often quite casual and affordable.
Take copies of your insurance policies and keep them and your insurance company's contact information with you.
They must show the insurer's email address and international telephone numbers for advice or authorization and for making claims.
Also keep one copy with your luggage and online (send it to yourself as an e-mail attachment or store it in the cloud).
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, keep one copy in its memory or on a disk (available without internet connection).
Also provide copies of insurance and contact information to your fellow travelers and relatives or friends who are willing to help.
Moose are not naturally aggressive, but defend themselves when they suspect danger.
When people do not consider elk to be potentially dangerous, they may approach them too much and put themselves in danger.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently, and it is important to know your own limits.
The longer-term effects of excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even blindness and death. The risk increases when drinking illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain a variety of dangerous contaminants, such as methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Spectacles can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
It is a good idea to get a vision check at home, especially if it is covered by insurance, and take the prescription with you to pick up elsewhere.
There may be two problems with luxury brand frames from such areas: some may be fake, and the right imported frames may be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the best-selling commodities in the world, and you are likely to be able to find many different types already in your area.
Nevertheless, there are many original coffee drinking habits around the world that are worth experiencing.
Canyoning means going to the bottom of a canyon, either dry or filled with water.
Canyoning combines elements from swimming, climbing and jumping, but getting started requires relatively little training or physical fitness (compared to rock climbing, instrument diving or alpine skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity consisting of walking in a natural environment, often on hiking trails.
Daytime hiking refers to distances that range from less than a mile to longer distances if they can be traveled in a single day.
Day hiking on an easy route requires very little preparation and is suitable for anyone in moderate condition.
People who move with young children may need more preparation, but a day out is easily accomplished even with babies and toddlers.
There are nearly 200 running organisations that organise city tours worldwide, most of them operating independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, is a network of tens of attractions running on four continents.
It originated in Barcelona-based Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen-based Running Copenhagen, and was quickly joined by Prague-based Running Tours Prague.
There are a number of things you need to take into consideration both before you travel somewhere and when you travel.
When you travel, do not expect things to be the same as at home. Habits, laws, food, traffic, accommodation, quality levels, language, etc., differ somewhat from those in your place of residence.
This needs to be kept in mind at all times to avoid disappointment or perhaps even disgust with local practices.
Travel agents have existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good choice for a trip that goes beyond the traveler's previous experience with nature, cultures, languages or low-income countries.
While most travel agencies gladly accept most standard reservations, many specialize in certain types of travel, price ranges, or destinations.
It may be better to use an official who will often book trips similar to those you are planning for yourself.
Check either the website or the shop window to see what kind of trips the representative offers.
If you want to see the world at a low cost - whether it's a necessity, a lifestyle, or the fact that you need a challenge - there are ways to do that.
In practice, they fall into two categories: you can either work while traveling or try to limit your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time and predictability for cost reduction close to zero, see minimum budget travel.
The advice assumes that tourists do not steal, trespass, operate on the black market, beg, or otherwise exploit people.
An entry checkpoint is usually the first stop after leaving an aircraft, ship or other vehicle.
On some international trains, checks are made while the train is in motion, and you must have a valid identity card with you when boarding such a train.
In night trains, the conductor may collect the passports so that your sleep does not need to be disturbed.
Registration is an additional requirement of the visa procedure. In some countries, you will need to provide the local authorities with information about your arrival and the address at which you are staying.
Requirements may include filling out a form at a local police station or a visit to the immigration office.
In many countries where such a law is in place, local hotels do the registration (it is worth asking to verify).
In other cases, only those staying outside the tourist accommodation have to register. However, this makes the law much less clear, so you should find out in advance.
Architecture is all about designing and building buildings. The architecture of a destination is often an attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at, and the view from a tall building or an inventively placed window can be eye-catching.
Architecture has a considerable overlap with other fields such as urban design, construction engineering, decorative arts, interior design, and landscape design.
Given how remote several pueblos are, you won't find a more prominent nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them also offer brand entertainment (especially the largest casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Beware: small-town bars around here are not always the best places to spend time for visitors.
First, drunk driving is a major problem in northern New Mexico, and concentrations of intoxicated drivers are prominent near bars in small towns.
Wall paintings or graffiti that are unwanted are known as graffiti.
While this is certainly not a new phenomenon, most likely associate it with the vandalization of public and private property by young people with spray paints.
Today, however, there are already established graffiti artists, graffiti events, and "legal" walls. Graffiti paintings in this context often resemble art instead of illegible tags.
Throwing a boomerang is a popular skill that many travelers want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang so that it returns to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang suitable for that purpose.
Most boomerangs available in Australia don't actually come back. Beginners better not try throwing in windy
The Hangi meal is prepared in a hot earth pit.
The pit is heated either by hot stones taken from the campfire, or in some places the geothermal heat heats some parts of the soil naturally.
Hang is often used to prepare a traditional barbecue-style dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer ground-heated scrub. Other types of scrub can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes for commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also called First Class) and Metro (also called Third Class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less cramped, but it's a little more expensive. On the other hand, it's still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro cars. MetroPlus cars are always at the end of the train on the Cape Town side.
Taking Care of Others - Never let your bags out of your sight, especially when crossing borders.
You may find yourself unknowingly a drug smuggler, causing you some very serious problems.
It involves standing in line, because drug dogs can be used at any time without a separate warning.
In some countries, even first-time offenders are given extremely severe punishments, such as more than 10 years in prison or death.
Unattended bags are vulnerable to theft and can also attract attention from authorities who are wary of bomb threats.
You are very likely to be immune to the bacteria in your area because you are constantly exposed to them.
But in other parts of the world whose bacteria strain is unknown to you, you are much more likely to face problems.
In addition, in warmer climates, bacteria both grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
And this is how you get the Travel Diarrhea, or the belly of Delhi, the curse of Pharaoh, the revenge of Montezuma and their many different friends.
Like cold-air respiratory problems, intestinal problems in hot climates are quite common and in most cases unquestionably embarrassing but not actually dangerous.
If you are travelling for the first time in a developing country — or in a previously unknown part of the world — do not underestimate the possibility of cultural shock.
The novelty of developing world tourism has surprised many routine and skilled tourists. In world tourism, small cultural adaptations have to be made all the time.
Especially in the first days, it is worth spending money on hotels, food and services that represent Western style and quality in order to facilitate adaptation.
Do not sleep on the ground on a mattress or sleeping pad in places whose fauna you are not familiar with.
If you plan to camp outside, bring a field bed or hammock to stay out of the reach of snakes and scorpions and the like.
Enjoy full-bodied coffee in the morning and relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
While on holiday, you will have time to pamper yourself and spend a few extra minutes simmering in something special.
If you feel more adventurous, take advantage of the opportunity and juice or mix a couple of smoothies:
You can even find a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, visit bars or pubs in areas you don't visit often.
For those who are unfamiliar with the medical vocabulary: the words infectious disease and infectious disease have different meanings.
Infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen such as a virus, bacterium, fungus, or other parasite.
An infectious disease is one that spreads easily by being near an infected person.
Many authorities require visitors or residents leaving the country to be vaccinated against a variety of diseases.
The requirements may often depend on which countries the traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the good things about Charlotte, North Carolina, is that there are a lot of high-quality options for families with children.
Residents from other areas often cite family friendliness as the main reason for moving to the city, and many visitors find it easy to enjoy the city with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of options suitable for children outside the heart of Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Families do not usually use taxis in Charlotte, but they can be useful in some situations.
More than two passengers will be charged an additional fee, so the option may be unnecessarily expensive.
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth and surrounds the South Pole.
Tourist visits are pricey, require physical fitness, can only take place during the summer months from November to February, and are mainly limited to the peninsula, islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand staff members live in about fifty bases in Antarctica during the summer, mostly in these areas, with a small number of them living through the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desolate plain covered by a layer of ice 2 to 3 kilometres thick.
Sometimes you can go inland on specialized air tours for mountaineering or travel to the pole. The South Pole has a large base.
The South Pole Road is a 1,600 km route to the pole from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea shore.
It is dense snow, with cracks filled and marked with flags. The route can only be traversed by special tractors that pull sleds containing fuel and supplies.
These are not very agile, so the route must make a long bend around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plain.
The most common cause of winter accidents is slippery roads, sidewalks, and especially stairs.
You will need at least footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery over ice and snow, and some winter shoes are also deficient.
The pattern should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more, and the material soft enough for cold temperatures.
Some shoes have studs, and for slippery conditions, studded slide barriers are available to fit most shoes and boots. They are attached to either the heel and sole of the shoe or to the sole of the heel alone.
The heel should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) is often sprinkled on roads and paths to improve traction.
Avalanches are not unusual; steep slopes are only able to hold a certain amount of snow, and the excess falls down as an avalanche.
The problem is the stickiness of the snow, so it needs a stimulus to come down. And when some of the snow comes down, it may act as a stimulus to the rest of the snow.
Sometimes the event is triggered by the beginning of snow warming in the sun, sometimes snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often human.
A tornado is a rotating column of very low pressure air that absorbs the surrounding air inwards and upwards.
They generate strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles per hour) and can lift heavy objects into the air, taking them with the tornado.
They originate as funnels coming down from storm clouds and turn into tornadoes when they hit the ground.
Providers of personal VPNs are a great way to circumvent both political censorship and commercial IP geo-filtering.
They are better than proxy servers for several reasons: they reroute all Internet traffic, not just http traffic.
Their bandwidth is often higher and the quality of service is better. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
Media companies routinely lie about its purpose, claiming it is "preventing illegal copying".
In fact, region codes have no effect on illegal copying: the identical copy of the disk works just as well on the same devices as the original.
The real purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets — it's all about making money.
Since calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use the telephone operator of your place of residence or destination.
Also, you don't need to get a phone number for where you live. You can get an Internet connection via satellite from the Chicken Wilderness Halls in Alaska and pick a number that would make you think you were in Arizona sunshine.
Often you have to buy a global number separately to be able to call you on the phone network. Where the number comes from matters to those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications that are able to translate entire pieces of text from one language to another.
Some applications in this category are even able to translate foreign-language text from signs or other real-world objects when the user points to them on their smartphone.
Translation machines have improved significantly and are now giving a somewhat correct translation (and less and less gibberish), but caution pays off, as even complete error is still possible.
One of the most notable applications in this category is Google Translator, which allows offline translation once the data for the desired language has been uploaded to the device.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you are not in your home country.
It can save you money compared to buying new maps for a GPS tracker, buying a completely new GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company.
If your phone does not have a data connection or when it is out of range of the data connection, their performance may be limited or non-existent.
Each corner kiosk has a confusing selection of prepaid call cards that can be used for payphones or regular phones.
Most cards are suitable for any type of call, but some specialize in offering affordable calls to specific groups of countries.
Often these services are used for free phone numbers, which you can call from most phones free of charge.
The rules of ordinary photography also apply to video photography, perhaps even more so.
If taking a picture of something is not allowed, the video should not even be considered.
If you plan to use the drone, check well in advance what you are allowed to film and what permits or other licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it is not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly from the airline before first searching and comparing fares.
Sometimes the prices of the same flight can differ considerably from one another on different compilation search sites, and it is worth comparing the search results and also looking at the airline's own website before making a booking.
While some countries do not require a visa for short tourist or business trips, going to them as an international student often requires a longer stay than as a casual traveler.
Generally speaking, spending a longer period of time in any foreign country requires obtaining a visa in advance.
Student visas are usually subject to different requirements and different application processes than tourist and work visas.
In most countries, you will need a letter from the institution where you want to study to provide a place to study, and you will also need to prove that you can afford to support yourself for at least the first year of your studies.
Check the detailed requirements from the educational institution and the immigration authorities of the country of study you wish to study.
If you are not a diplomat, working abroad usually means that you have to pay income tax in your country of residence.
Income tax is formed in different ways in different countries, and tax rates and tax categories vary greatly from country to country.
In some federal states, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is collected at both federal and local levels, so tax rates and categories may vary from region to region.
Although when you return home, an entry check is usually either missing or merely a formality, a customs check can be a hassle.
Make sure you know what you are allowed and not allowed to bring in, and to customs anything beyond the legal import limits.
The easiest way to get started in the travel writing industry is to hone your skills on an established travel blog site.
Once you learn how to format and edit online, you can later create your own website.
Volunteering during travel is a good way to make a difference, but it is not just about giving.
Living abroad while doing volunteer work is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn things about yourself, develop a sense of proportion, and even gather new skills.
It can also be a good way to stretch the budget to allow for a longer stay, as many volunteer jobs include food and maintenance, and some even pay a small wage.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used. Check the possible need for special permits, which can be difficult to obtain.
The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea via Onego, Ladoga and St. Petersburg, mostly along rivers and lakes.
The lake is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to get there from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
You can be sure that when you get to the marina, everything will be pretty self-explanatory. You will meet other boat hitchhikers, and they will share their knowledge with you.
In practice, you put up announcements where you offer help, you walk around the docks, you approach people who are cleaning up their yachts, you try to talk to sailors at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. Soon everyone will know you and give tips on which boat needs helpers.
You should carefully choose which airline alliance companies you choose for your loyalty program.
While you may think it makes sense to become the frequent flyer of the airline you fly with the most, you should know that the privileges offered are often different and frequent flyer customers are more likely to receive flight points from another airline of the same alliance.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services to Africa and provide connecting flights to many of Africa's major cities at a more competitive price than European airlines.
Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries (as of 2014).
If you have extra travel time, you should check how the total price of an African trip compares to the price of a round-the-world trip.
Don't forget to add extras for extra visas, airport taxis, ground transportation, etc. in all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world in the Southern Hemisphere alone, selectable flights and destinations are limited due to the lack of intercontinental routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (nor does SkyTeam cover the first).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern part of the South Pacific between Santiago de Chile and Tahiti. It is a Oneworld flight with LATAM.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America (see below).
In 1994, the ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan waged war against the Azeris.
With the support of the Armenians, a new republic was created and is not officially recognized by any established state, even Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes over control of the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a famous 17th-century area that surrounds Binnenstad in Amsterdam.
The whole area has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its unique cultural and historical value, and its property prices are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, meaning five countries, consists of five small coastal villages in the Liguria region of Italy: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.
They are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces in rough and steep terrain right up to the cliffs on the seashore.
The lack of visible commercialisation is part of its charm. Trails, trains and ships connect villages, and cars cannot reach them from the outside.
The French forms spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France, but they are similar enough to be mutually intelligible.
In particular, the French-speaking Belgian and Swiss numeral system has its subtle peculiarities, which differ from the French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words differs slightly.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss have learned standard French at school, so they will understand you even if you use the normal French number system.
In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture that means greeting.
However, in Malaysia, and at least among rural Malaysians, it means "come here" a bit like the gesture used in some Western countries, where the index finger is bent towards the body, and should be used only for that purpose.
Similarly, in Spain, a British traveler may confuse a wave of goodbye with a palm facing the waver (rather than the waver), as a request to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or artificial languages created to facilitate communication between people who would otherwise have difficulty communicating with each other.
They are different from lingua francas, i.e. natural or organic languages, which for one reason or another have risen to the dominant position as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
Travellers may see mirages in the heat of the day that create an illusion of water (or something else).
They can be dangerous if the traveler strives toward mirage, wasting precious energy and remaining water.
Even the hottest deserts can be extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real risk without warm clothes.
Especially in summer, you have to watch out for mosquitoes if you decide to go hiking through the rainforest.
Even if you are driving through a subtropical rainforest, opening the doors for a few seconds while entering the vehicle is enough for mosquitoes to enter the car with you.
Avian influenza can be transmitted to both birds and mammals.
Fewer than 1,000 cases have been recorded in humans, but some have been fatal.
Most have been accompanied by people working with poultry, but even birdwatchers are slightly exposed.
Steep fjords and valleys, which suddenly turn into a somewhat flat massif, are typical of Norway.
These plains are often referred to as vidde, which means wide and open woodless area, borderless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are usually referred to by the word hi, which means a treeless moor often covered with heather.
Glaciers are not stable, but are flowing down the mountainside, causing cracks and cracks that may be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of ice caves may collapse and the cracks close.
At the edges of the glaciers, huge boulders shed, fall, and may pop or roll further away from the edges.
The tourist season for mountain stations usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, they have different beauty and charm in winter, with many mountain stations getting brisk snow and providing opportunities for activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer so-called grief fares, which make last-minute funeral trips a little cheaper.
The airlines offering them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights departing from the United States and Canada, and Westjet.
In all cases, the reservation must be made by phone directly with the airline.
