9-year-old boy on the run from Tampere found
Police have been on a search mission for a nine-year-old boy's escape from Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening News around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the debriefing.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again furiously tore goal difference in Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued to make his way into the Champions League as well.
The fight between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal kingship turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid moved to the top of the all-time goal scorer record alone when he shot two hits in visitor Shahtar Donetsk's net for penalty kicks and one for the playing situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80, while Barcelona's Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has a total of 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have been stumbling in the Italian Football League in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League they started off strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus' Alvaro Morata just over ten minutes before the end.
City's attack was blunted by the absence of a knee-wrenching Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's Premier League game, did not enter the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United were also hard hit in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old linebacker Luke Shaw's away game lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the goal-attacking ManU kit so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to the hospital for treatment.
Memphis Depay took the guests to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The goal scoring season in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria, an Argentinian who had changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG nut.
Di Maria broke through to the right and picked up the ball in the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the winners of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's minor clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional starter Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in the Moscow CSKA lost Group B match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party calls for immediate resignation - President delivers wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament again, which he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had occurred solely at Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's impact on the country's economy before and now.
Germany and Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders for next week due to the refugee crisis.
European Council President Donald Tusk, who heads the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively those coming to Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the Home Affairs Ministers' table.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during emergency call
Shannon Lamb, a college teacher with only a slight color, tells the police during an emergency call that she shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, as well as saying that the contact details of the deceased woman's next of kin can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on the side of the anger: "I'm so very sorry I wish I could undo this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said the letter, which experts say was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a kept history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his study room.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal 911 call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the stanza.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive a day after students and staff had been forced to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who, however, may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for her classes.
Police in the town of Prentiss, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended courses for both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policies meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and an assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb escaped from campus, police tracked him down when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house in the Mississippi suburb of Greenville, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his Ph.D. in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb said she was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play the guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when he was there, according to Hairston, now 40, who lives in Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described her daughter.
She was her mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, a shady bar near Gautier, says that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance to a sparse audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were fooling around and throwing squabbles at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year students' seminar program and specialized in Indian and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, the school's English teacher.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday night, a candlelight devotional was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended Mass, during which the University Choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been fixed according to the fact that the police now say that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but a retailer of toy and baby products says current regulars and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 employed during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with the applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although there are months left in the holiday season, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as the sale, shipping, and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a hugely important moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's seat was next to me," she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The film begins and it occurs to me that I'm just a fake yawn and a stretch of my hand from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "For me, it's arguably the greatest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available on demand video, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
UN chief says Syria situation will not be solved militarily
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "will not be resolved by armed means", and additional weapons will only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with the General Assembly's ministerial week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on the five permanent member states to show the kind of solidarity and consensus they showed when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 Support Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to brand him as a wind vane.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting to collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump out of the top spot in support polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been in charge of a double-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's nomination prospects.
Of course, the election period is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom got behind any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump's persistence and have begun to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support poll results suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, support polls from Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Currently, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two in ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% "enthusiastic" vs. Trump's 40%).
The Next Most Exciting?
Marco Rubio at only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, a favorite of those in power, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, according to Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters at the national level think that the real estate king has a character appropriate for the president.
According to Quinnipiac's poll last week, the number in Iowa, which hosts the first party convention, is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has the right temperament for a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think his character isn't appropriate for being president, and nearly six out of ten feel his character doesn't belong in the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten people said Trump was the most likely candidate to be nominated by Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican Party voters have not always had access to the brightest crystal ball possible.
At this time in the last legislature, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry would be nominated, with only 28 percent supporting the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters find the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans sided with another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support is divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump gains majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a big 18-point gap.
The vast majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made the decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump-supporting voters have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say with absolute certainty that he will never change his mind.
46% said they could potentially change their candidacy.
In any case, Trump's biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pomp will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's First Appearance in Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, meets David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and is likely to be closely watched by both the media and Labour MPs for his performance.
Corbyn has called for "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem at Tuesday's memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has attracted criticism among Conservative MPs and appeared in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "stands respectfully silent" and that he recognizes "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the Great Britain Air War."
A member of Corbyn's shadow government, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite his belief that the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements over economic, defense and foreign affairs, initially supported by less than a sixth of the parliamentary party as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences regarding the party's position in the European Union, as well as the government's subsidy cap, have also "accumulated" within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that the Labour Party is proposing an amendment that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's Secretary of Labor and Pensions, Smith, stated that the party was "quite clear" about their only opposition to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced in the past decade to be the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "massed" ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Hours is too confrontational and that he intends to refrain from both witty words and snarling, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's financial secretary, Angela Eagle, will be his substitute during Question Time when Corbyn is not attending - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could also be allowed to speak at times, and he has said that he has approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, about the matter.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the kind of political theater that is often associated with Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later had to admit his failure.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important gauge in assessing the leader's discretion, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized Question Hours for becoming just a travesty that calls for far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless youth trained as photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The value of the pound jumped after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the bid target SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of rising rates.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive stock on the market and rose 20 percent after being approached by competitor AB InBev with an offer.
The agreement would unite the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry stock rose 0.9 percent after encouraging news from rival luxury group Richmont.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The Mondi shares of the packaging and paper group were the largest contributors to the index at 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation of the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1 percent after a sportswear company announced its six-month profit before taxes: an 83% increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports chief executive says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, president of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the UK, it could mean "increasing the purchasing power of potential consumers."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labor costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs might be focused on the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi infiltration
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi attack in southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in southern and western Australia prior to Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores to come. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food retailers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, an ice cream maker from Dunsborough, offer samples at IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regulars.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29 as this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, with South and West Australia making up nearly 30% of the IGA stores in Metcash combined, with higher margins of return than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South and West Australian shoppers are known to be parochial, with IGA dealers having a much larger market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening its first stores.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south and 30 in the west next year, generating revenues of $500 and $600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, a manager of a leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly disappear in a decade."
Metcash has declined to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of Metcash's board of directors had contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenues from Metcash's food and food business, which distributes products to approximately 1,200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, indicating a reduction in debt financing for operations when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler stands its ground, and has invested more than $150 million annually in lowering the prices of hundreds of products each week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers renovate stores by adding faster-growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private label products to market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that lowering prices and improving stores have increased appeal, and he hopes the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism for his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a bystander in a recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, who deserves credit rather than criticism for his own conduct, says Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
A younger member of the talented duo known as "Special Ks" Kokkinakis was unwittingly made public about the incident in which Kyrgios annoyed Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after, in a fiery qualifier match in Cincinnati, the Chief Justice had to twice separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his bat after a cramp ruined his potential win over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another spot in the doubles with Bernard Tomic in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup against Britain.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that Thanasi has just been dragged into the brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost for a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he's frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved extremely well, even in rather provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
He is very mature by the age of 19, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he trains hard, is in good shape and is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged according to his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra player's return to the team's regulars.
"We want the team to be completely focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time away from the public to consider these consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of damming the flow of migrants entering the country.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People fleeing the violence of their homelands have now pitched their tents and set themselves on the road for an indefinite period of time between the checkpoints of the two countries.
Frustration grew, however.
While the police helicopter stayed above them, the immigrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible" to accept the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The debate will have to take place in the next few days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The conflict at the border between Hungary and Serbia came after a group of 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they spoke hopefully about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in 120,000 additional refugees, including part of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an additional EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed roads to be closed and asylum cases to be expedited.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that the majority of those arriving are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not those fleeing from war who are entitled to protection - this view strongly contradicts that of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia as a crime, as well as containing longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal crossing of borders is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the expected deployment of troops for next week, but Associated Press journalists at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's national security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had arrested 45 people as they tried to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already reached the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a railcar covered with barbed wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to handle people and the crowds tried to barge in.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National poll shows Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue in the double-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is scurrying to catch up with her.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the Democratic electorate (down from 58%), and Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will enter the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary, the majority of Democratic voters state that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who they would vote for.
However, Clinton supporters stand more firmly behind their own choice than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader among women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and she is now tied with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit number among liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they will enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes the party's candidate.
A quarter said they would support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
6% would not support him at all.
Not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are very likely eager to support her.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters (35 percent) say the same of Republican number one Donald Trump.
When Clinton's supporters were asked in an open-ended question why they wanted her to run, the most popular answer was that she had suitable experience (16 percent). The most popular responses then were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also cited his affiliation with Bill Clinton (9%).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the vice president influences a potential presidential nomination, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if a third disagrees.
When asked who they would pick second for the party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton supporters say they would choose Biden, which is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden chooses not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership of Sanders will grow, and if Biden goes along, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he opts out, the number will be 30.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
By this standard, Biden remains far behind, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voted for has increased.
However, when asked what is most important about the candidate, the Democratic voters put their opinions ahead of the vote.
Also, last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden does best in the trio in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, which is twice as many as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally agree that Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are ideologically aligned.
Looking at all of these things, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion about Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State still raises questions, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the issue and say it did not affect their general opinion of her.
But it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split in March shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans say that the email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
While Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month as well as 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson, and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but many have no opinion about him, much like Carson.
The margin of error in the study, which included 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates garnered half of all the votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% in the previous CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News election debate to 27% on Tuesday.
At the same time, however, Carson soared from 6% to 23%.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with various demographic groups and is ousting Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen the most: from 10 percent last month to the current 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third place at 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll, conducted in September, is +/- 6%.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson rising in polls: he has 19% support among Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him by 32%.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was far ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon in vain, though Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged with Death of Baruch College First-Year Student
Nearly two years after a student died in a fraternity hazing ceremony in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, a murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of Baruch College in New York City brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership rite in September 2013, and then delayed his hospitalization, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Officials say Deng's eyes were blindfolded and he was loaded with a backpack weighing over 30 pounds [13 kg] full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled on the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field toward the finish line.
Eventually Deng complained that his head was hurting, after which he lost consciousness.
The Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but allegedly waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's national chairman, Andy Meng, for advice," police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus virtually put the welfare of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated blunt force trauma to the head, body and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fratricidal spree, with at least one student dying each year as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
Monroe County grand jury upholds first five members charged with third-degree murder
Thirty-two other Brotherhood members, including Meng, are also charged with violent hazing and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to hold individuals accountable; if there's an organisation behind what happened, whether formally or informally, they should be held accountable as well," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity broke off contact with the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
Interest rate hikes will come, and the markets for rising rates will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will go into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take or how long it's going to take.
The past does little to help with timing when it comes to the economy in particular.
The recession has lasted for only 11 months since the first drawdown, while sometimes it has lasted as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why officials at the Federal Reserve have been so emphatic that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the trajectory of time it takes for the situation to normalize.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants can see that all the fuss about raising interest rates has been excessive.
"The Central Bank's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," Julian Jessop, chief global economics expert at Capital Economics, said in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to normal, though still low, levels will be the kind of cataclysmic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have effects.
Below is a look at how some sectors of the economy will react based on past developments:
As has been seen in the market over the past month or so, waiting to raise interest rates can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stagnate for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which again potentially reflects the lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the increase in the central bank.
More specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market is generally experiencing a strong, approximately 14 percent increase as you approach the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly flat (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and normality has been reached after 500 days with an average return of 14.4% in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, a leading equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's magazine.
According to the Deutsche Bank, the impact on stocks tends to be clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle as returns begin to decline.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rate hikes often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges that have not existed before, and which could spur a recession.
This is particularly the case for gross domestic product, which will be the closest to its all-time low before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, the nominal annual GDP has only twice been less than 4.5%.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 percent, reports the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raises the question of "whether this time will be different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for a central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe that the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicts only a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that since 1950, all increase cycles have so far occurred in supercycles of increasing leverage, where GDP has passed its pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun," the report says.
In contrast, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited by far the longest for the last recession to end: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already in its 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been volatile with the market expecting an interest rate hike, and the model somewhat resembles the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when a central bank changes its policy, its effects are reflected more quickly in bonds than in stocks.
The direction of bond yields appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields will drop immediately," said the Deutsche Bank.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause a convergence of yields on longer-term and shorter-term bonds, thereby smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better returns in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about looking for returns," stated Kathy Jones, a fixed-yield analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the policy expectations of the central bank.
"Beyond the dollar's strength and declining inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit spreads have increased and volatility has increased - all these are characteristic of markets when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a high level of debt perform worse when a rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months after the first rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Firms with strong turnovers outperformed those with weak turnovers after 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than those with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable-rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's rise in value.
Also, savers can make a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "democracy"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor is becoming more and more difficult
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only mimic the Brit Awards.
MP Damien Collins criticizes The Voice, saying it's not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "becoming" Classic FM, claims leading MP, adding to the pressure on the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio channel appeared to "populate" its content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term 'popularize' - is becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be just another Brit Awards under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples I can remember directly, when in fact you're just copying something that's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and information sharing with the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"Furthermore, I think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel needed to do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering that was criticized for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during a hearing with the Culture, Media and Sport Special Committee.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music contest that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is by no means original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with the star judges Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in the style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside its own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to stop future The Voice seasons from being produced, or to order that the money from the licensees be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far rose the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
Last month had the lowest increase since the start of statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were boosted by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe November's Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown dramatically for more than a decade, transforming many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say there are now signs of online sales leveling off, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew the least since the beginning of statistics in 2000: only five per cent up from last year.
Experts say there are signs of online sales leveling off, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, a JMRG sales index provider, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be done in different environments, such as on a couch.
But now it flattens out, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America has been considered one of the reasons behind the slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the usual average, more shoppers flocked to their computers to grab trades, knocking down the websites of many merchants.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over the findings, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound out of five was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane accident, Bin Laden's family with sanctions
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 dead across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames collapse on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
The 29 dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them. The victims died when a crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mainly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A sad procession passed by a holy place where just a few days ago a crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family construction group responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed by the crane in the Grand Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, a father of four from the Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already vowed that hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands continue to enter the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decision, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors have been banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall on the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not released any reports of the collapse of the crane, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and of not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
Around the Grand Mosque of Mecca, there are dozens of cranes that are part of a huge construction raid led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi dynasty for decades and is leading major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the late leader of al-Qaeda, was a rebellious boy whose family banned him in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather just days before millions enter the kingdom for a pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in hospital.
Authorities ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and those permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says East European cheap laborers are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of helpers, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint pens and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workmen to do home repairs
It seems that if you're handy with a hammer or a hack to paint walls, you're in the minority now.
The British are hiring more and more helpers to do do-it-yourself work in their homes, the boss of the company behind B&Q says.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home improvement stores, said that the popularity is due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a derisory price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workmen and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchase decisions made in the store are made specifically by the fair sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more single-woman households with more home improvement work than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women to lead one of the most important companies in the UK's FTSE100 index. She has rebuilt her management team with an equal number of male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% women in its group, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women for the leadership team."
Kingfisher reported a decline in both six-month returns and sales after the group took the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores.
The three aces government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to be forced right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the extensive demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that's when reason stands.
Ask them if they should go on strike when things are not going well.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to participate in the protest, but are going to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring oneself a scab would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people by the million-member trade unions does not take much time, but it does give something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the trade union movement's activities, the violent solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight, it is now time for the unions to finally get to the point of defending the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
The government may thus wish to perhaps strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline, and unemployment will rise.
These things should be forcing everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta on a hard austerity course: Aiming for savings of 8.5 million, staff to be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will begin a savings program with the goal of cutting costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will begin co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
An additional two million will be saved from other activities.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by budget cuts made by the government.
During this fiscal year, the university will make about 2.6 million in deficit.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university's total budget is about 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten percent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research as well as a decrease in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli from the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding is reflected in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland for railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK's largest rail companies," Souter says.
Rail transport is to open up to competition gradually.
The first will be commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed by the Ministry of Transport.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the U.S. Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision as to whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, just over half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation will not be resolved and interest rates will be kept at the current 0-0.25 percent level.
This is a historic event, as it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has performed relatively well, and the recovery has brought in trillions of dollars in balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they must be ready for lift-off, but the signs also indicate that they believe that the odds are against lift-off.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "sick" about the first murder and hoped, "that he could undo it," authorities said on Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier police reported that Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "doesn't bother anyone" but is probably upset.
Police asked the caller his name, but he didn't tell them.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from 45-year-old Lamb that read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday when police surrounded him.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt as far as he knew, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite allegations released on Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any kind of "triangular drama."
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked".
O'Steen said that Prentiss and his daughter were "all best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked from home online. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car at the side of the road, left it there, and went running into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his PhD in Education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a curriculum vitae found on the university's website.
The Stars Who Lost Their Charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough time in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009, his long-time partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumor has it that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this really takes a toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and will be out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into PSV territory.
He was treated for 9 minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
This is terrible, a boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and now this is what's going to happen.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he doesn't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he received only a red card and a penalty shot.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian agent was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to express how disappointed I am, my recovery starts now, I'll be back stronger."

The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If any player is forced out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to offend an opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico against Van Gaalin Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that's a bad thing," Cocu said.
I did not see in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this kind of thing can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after being sued by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than that, doesn't he?
Each parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before you almost memorize it.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by the holiday childcare service about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post posted on SuperCamps' website and continues, "Funny, moving, creative and with a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details were added to fill the fairly short original text.
"In the town of Tarville, within the walls, where all nature has disappeared and even air is a commodity, Ted the boy hopes to win the heart of his dream girl by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the real tree," the text says and describes a love story that Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this isn't suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text sounds in some places like it was taken from the plot summary for the Internet Movie Database film Lorax, which begins: "In the town of Tarville, inside the walls, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted boy hopes to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book. In it, a young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by a greedy, wood-cutting, and need-weaving Kerskanen, ignoring the short, moustache-like creature Lorax who gave the story the name, who "speaks for the trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the prime minister said the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being sidelined from the England team, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England have chosen for the tour, I don't think a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't rule out a win-win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but it involves good beaters and the team's mindset is strong: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali evolves in his spiral passes and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave the Adam Lyth team is understandably tricky to analyze for me because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against strikers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged by their scores.
There was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice, for example, before the announcement, because, as I've said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was himself responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform quite as well as he could, and that doesn't surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter gets to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton got a chance to play both at home and away.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
As a cricketer, he has that something we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge pitch.
He must at least be given the same chance as the others before him, but this of course depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a lot of balling about the idea of a Moeen at the batting opening next to Cook, which would give the field an extra pitcher but keep four quick ones, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why a hitter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed one has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is number three to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games at the first grid drop before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not reminisce about the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, with the little I've had to do with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished stats - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there aren't too many pitchers available and the selectors chose young people.
He's learning a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan hitter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a stroke of genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in every situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along for the white ball games, and brings with him both energy and a relentless flicker.
I've always thought he was born to be in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of exploitable wit as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested at a one-day event, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and picks don't make schedules.
And it must be remembered that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Those in favour of Britain leaving the EU (Brexit) may win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are getting into bigger and bigger trouble every day, even if one ignores even the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it a yes or no?" Corbyn's choice to lead the Labour Party or the trade union confederation's anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A fellow European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are fed up with the self-centered agenda of Britain, which is full of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that these countries for the most part do not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that they also did not want them if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local eye-catcher, and then come home saying they will win supporters for the reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the UK's EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say from Berlin - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capital cities are now at a point where they don't care we stay then we leave.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets ruined in the same way that happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading force, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the selfie Britons when their energy would be better directed at preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want that either because of similar separatist tendencies of their own.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even plan to make deliberately useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"Renegotiations had been arranged" and "Renegotiations had no meaning for Britain."
Europeans have bitterly experienced how voracious the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the press monarchs are, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself by writing about "EU straight bananas" while he was a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-guests, phone-hacking foreigners, and people nominally based elsewhere who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually felt exactly the same way about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a horny gorilla, you have to give up bananas for a distraction unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch menu and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair himself when it came to opposing Cameron's renegotiation stunt, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster House of Parliament on Monday (I told him he didn't have any more time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of reintroducing Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch, a strategy that was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr, from whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it nicely, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the UK Independence Party's UKIP war paint zeal as well as the Conservative Party's most ferocious nationalists can certainly put themselves behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not a Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when her inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a rugged John McDonnell as shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law was struggling on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's efforts were more tempting.
But the fight to keep up with "anywhere in the situation" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, nor, by all accounts, what Corbyn told the principals and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional, and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the age of 24-hour television, and especially in the whirlpool of social media, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and deception.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take the Labour Party's support in the referendum campaign for granted.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic twist on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just an elusive debate among left-wing dissidents for whom narcissism of minor differences is a central dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try and explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it could be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England's e-cigarette assessment
Investigators have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated with a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released this "milestone" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published an editorial attacking the "exceptionally shaky basis" of PHE's main conclusion.
Two other scientists who wrote in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on detailed evaluation and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a single meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinion of the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company name EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly previously received funding from Brish American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
He also supported the public health powers of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they had received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was reported to have received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting the panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes a number of well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also say that they have received funding from the industry in the study.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco director.
The research produced by the group "expressively admits" that there is a lack of "indisputable evidence regarding harm in most products and in most criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who burn for life die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence looks like and what it doesn't look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their drawbacks are only a fraction of those of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 director says
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial rivals would "give anything" for such hits as this soap opera set on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to make programmes that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, in difficult broadcasting times against the most watched programmes of competitors and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organisations, Johnson said he tried to build a relationship with the BBC for six years at the time, to no avail.
"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and broadcasts programmes that are clearly suitable for unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its research into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this medium or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not do and produce.
The Voice is being broadcast at its most important broadcast time because of the desire to garner as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders the other, undeniably implemented inside the house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't see how it's about a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC is guilty of hunting for ratings "because of the goals of the people who work there, and because they believe it's the best way to achieve long-term support."
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such shows as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller audience's public service programmes "go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then hypocritically state that 'sure, we are doing all these unknown programmes that nobody is watching'."
They put them in a broadcast location where no one ever comes to see them.
Regarding the permit fee, Johnson told the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its early mission of "information, education and entertainment".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as education - he said the figures are 1% TV production and 0.1% radio - and that it should take inspiration from Australian and Canadian radio stations and change the task to "information, education and entertainment".
Regarding partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms concerts, which he says only a few are shown on television, and team up with commercial companies so that all of these can be viewed online.
"Sound genetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered neural systems so that they can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse too high for the human ear to hear.
The impulses work by switching on genetically engineered motion neurons with membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that the worms show the functionality of a new method, called voice genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method may one day replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which people's brains are led to electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttle pods do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles amplified ultrasonic waves, which then travel inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To make ultrasonically-guided nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motion neurons have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, where they turn on the modified motion neurons.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light impulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that needs to be sent along an optical fiber to a desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may make it possible for targeted human neurons to momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Advertisements put Britain's arms trade to shame
Watch the Amnesty International anti-gun show video.
Terrifying killer machines!
Ankle-crushing leg braces!
Cluster bombs!
And electronic stun batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to peddle arms to repressive governments at a party held at the Defence and Security Equipment International's ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard area.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared at bus stops and subway trains, which required more familiarity.
"Important Announcement, Will You Travel the DLR Route September 15-18?" together asked using the London Underground font and brand name, as the DLR track becomes the image of the tank.
This September, a horde of gun dealers arrive on the DLR route... Customers are asked to help stop the gun fair.
These 300 posters were created by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Cruel Designs).
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound pack of hex keys that, according to the collective, "will get access to one-third of the advertising space at the bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "poster vandalism".
One of the parody commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political works to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on resistance fronts when they realize they have to go to the outside world if their art wants to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arms poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours, created for free by advertising agency VCCP, and also worked for free by a graphic designer and background commentator.
VCCP creative director Matt Leverin found that the gun show was not advertised at all — and there was also an empty spot on the ExCeL calendar at the time — and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic ad for a shady corporation, but "it was more arresting to emphasize the issue with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," Tom Davies of Amnesty said.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in terms of gun fairs comes from the inside of ExCeL, as exhibitors trade in fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that it received an order from the U.S. military for "a shoulder-launched AT4CS RS."
This includes a "unique tube charge combat tip that exerts excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dorm
It's been 11 years since, ignorantly at 19, I moved into a student dormitory, when I still believed in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of people I annoyed - and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from nerve-wracking to totally scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, if you liked the gap year and where, what do you think of Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHAHA I'll be found in my room".
Take a breath.
And also help others take a breath - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like and not the ones you don't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they're sharing fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and public places of entertainment, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place of rest, but many dormitories form a culture of room-to-room wandering that is friendly, social, and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can gather back the energy I expended talking to you."
Try to sense when a college friend is tired of socializing - and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A guy in my dormitory felt that if the door wasn't locked, he'd been invited in.
He saw some pretty big things.
Make friends through baking.
Since you're starting college in the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate pastry plate and introducing yourself seems to be somewhat less odd, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile as I ask you personal questions" from a 50s person.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and it may be that they will combine your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk in your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if it boils internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to deal with it more adultly than my roommate, who mixed his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noise so that people do not get to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial cauldron beating the pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play their drum and bass music slower because it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before making her own music roar, locked her door, and left for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your dorm partner as your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all of your mutual friends to him.
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if the hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to talk some sense into your bottom end.
In the exhilarating moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good prank is fun, but can be canceled in an instant.
You can give a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something - but never mess someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but do not attach their possessions with a blue sticker to the ceiling more than twice at most.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - House planned as reception centre stained in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on a student accommodation in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the Evangelical Folk High School of Kitee.
The windows and walls of the dormitories of the Kansanopisto were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the dormitories' windows, according to the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for youth social guarantee education at Kansanopisto, an estimated ten people were in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move around, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The Folk High School houses people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the cluttered building has a-status.
Some are studying in the comprehensive school for adults, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a press conference was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We have had more than a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men and had been travelling in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend night, as this topic has now been afloat.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported by MTV on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Focus 15.9. at 16:02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the target building.
State shuts down Y train to Karjaa - passengers annoyed, "quite idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raseborg Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news infuriated passengers who boarded the train in the early evening at Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the shutdown will hit the people of Siuntio, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but a matter of political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in an interview video with HSTV that he will come to the capital by tractor, for example.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services from during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will be approved later by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that a state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raseborgians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their journey," he said as he climbed on the Y train.
A little relief is provided.
There will probably be a new train connection to the shoreline, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This leads to increased costs for HSL, i.e. in practice the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the cost.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y-train, of course, the ministry much more than this.
The R line on the main line misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services will decrease on the Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu routes.
More than half a million trips are made per year on the routes to be discontinued, while the total number of trips in traffic purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new deal is expected to bring $12.3 million in annual savings to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital topicality book: "Marx is worth getting acquainted with"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, who is known as the former chairman of the Communist Party, in the book The topicality of Marx's Capital published today.
"He is taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalization, and encroachment of capitalist economy on an increasing scale on all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
Based on the Capital seminars organized by Hakanen, the author list also includes Aalto University professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
However, the former Managing Director of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Delegation of the Finnish Economy is not a Marxist, is he?
Oh, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that were too far-reaching from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Again, Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are being discussed.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological revolution," Korkman analyses.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is of no help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Yet, in Korkman's view, it is worth studying Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hated each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past.
"Every social scientist should become familiar with Marx's mindset - as with other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the AFP news agency reports.
The United Nations report on the civil war in 1983-2009 came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers for the war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, the major offensive by the armed forces in the final months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan Armed Forces of torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides, according to the report, have committed murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it plans to organize the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow a UN tribunal to be set up because of foreign judges.
English yo-exam allowed to weigh in on social media
On Wednesday, the autumn matriculation exams were conducted in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 trainees tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject from social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-word article in English could be addressed to the online magazine's advice column keeper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He was to be asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the subject, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," assessed Mia Lybeck, the English lecturer at Porvoo Swedish-speaking upper secondary school.
The third item was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one, according to Lybeck, was quite nice.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing speech writing," Lybeck says and evaluates the entire experiment as "quite normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large masses of data.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn writings continue on Friday, when it is time for another Finnish test, i.e. the Swedish or Finnish test.
In high schools, the test is organised normally, meaning that the employees' demonstration does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time to make it to the test.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop in Oulu was robbed at gunpoint
A shop in the Clock district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothing and a commando hat covering his face.
The man is of normal body and about 30 years old.
According to police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government's cuts will block Helsinki city centre on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of SAK, Akava and STTK unions meet at Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be taking part in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out the alarm duties and other police activities, but also to secure the smooth running of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles between approximately 9.30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie in the direction of the west.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least, it seems like enough is enough.
I don't take sides on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The exact patrol numbers are not given by the police.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging people to avoid using private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With the arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the Railway Square.
In principle, the buses are quite far away.
The rest of the way must then be walked to the protest site," Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The question of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now partly handled by itself.
The organizers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, the people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held across Finland on Friday.
The demonstration on Friday is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good reference point for it in Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Siiriäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says Soiäinen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough stance is lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the trade union movement is really trying to bring to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement certainly does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration brings about in the crowd that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a point of reference for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organized in 1993, says Soiäinen.
Organised in the midst of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho's (center) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than it was at the time of Murrost Thursday.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, says Soiäinen.
The current coalition government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time of the boom, there were still certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and potentially close day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it may become the largest in years.
Around 300 demonstrations have taken place in Helsinki each year in recent years.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Soiäinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s Metal and Electric Strikes
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electric strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a motion of the settlement board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% pay rise.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Breakthrough Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many made unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The strike by firefighters was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police officers were caught in egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU quits," was one of the slogans.
The farmers at Espa dumped tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and mass dismissals of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass secession eventually accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation investigates background of Finnish truck full of refugees for Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in determining the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police in Aisterheim, near the German border, stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those who were in the refrigerated truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Superintendent Tero Haapala of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees in Austria who had travelled by truck were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by asphyxiation.
According to Yleisradio, who first told about the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug mule, and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book, Death's Travel Agency, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, come up with solutions, and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat the hell out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer holidays.
Due to their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
By comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for a fisherman to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until it flared up again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
At midnight, we go out in the water with extinguished lanterns.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
He relates in the book that when the police once spotted him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one by the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he has his compatriots to beat this one up for this.
I'll beat the hell out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are allowed to enter.
In the forests around the city centre, men who travel without their families are housed in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but that's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walks in rough terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Arriving in the Bogovaða area, a major hub for human smuggling, people are exhausted to death.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to haggle.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly goofy goofy all the way.
First you agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he will work cheaper than others and will charge only 50 euros per person for the ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about three hundred kilometers, most comfortably on the highway.
Colleagues are reportedly asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants closer than 12 kilometres to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
He then points his customers in the right direction and dashes away.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is frequented by many believers who have fled the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.
The client will initially call one of the Missionary's five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide your money wisely and soar among the peddlers who cross the border.
In order to gain asylum seeker or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have been forced to flee their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary organizes a new identity for the client.
The old ID will be destroyed and a replacement will be acquired.
It is aided by missionary contacts with the Ugandan police.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the migration process, for example, to a European country costs 4 500-7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a fledgling smuggler, a former drug mule.
The 40-year-old Irishman is on call off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan living in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human-smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 freeway, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the freeway to a rest stop, where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - he has to make sure that it's on its way to England and not Holland, for example - and cuts across the safety wire of the tarpaulin.
It has to be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but that's when it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to the one they wrap around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should keep the police thermal scanner from spotting the hider.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the scene in the hope that the driver will not snag stowaways, at least until Britain does.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
Upporika Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who dominates sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and is constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: from Turkish ports, yachts are rented to supposedly take American or European families on nice tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately 53,000 euros for one luxury vessel trip after the costs.
He doesn't do the practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred homes through shell companies that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of parliament of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.

An American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published snippets of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He entered the games in top condition and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the finish, his strength ran out.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other contestants passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line," Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of making money from having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her action.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he longed for adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life was revealed in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's number one in the 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The World Champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster in check: "straight-backed"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the line of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Like last year, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wresting all summer and autumn from the athlete agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion either.
As a result of the agreement dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northugi from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster in check.
"Thank you for showing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on her Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season's national team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also look after future generations, and not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and non-financial privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug released his own statement, in which he asserted that he would like to play sports in Norwegian colours in the World Cup next season as well as in the World Cup and the Olympic Games thereafter.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two gold ones.
He was part of the team that won relay gold in Falun last winter.
Roast translators' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. Day 25 September, various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the S.H.I.E.L.E.L.D. badge will host the events.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the sign as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but top restaurants that have been inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of raising awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most significant international events, taking place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country for the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre has been appealed to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-army currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure for the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, the placement of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been investigated in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that for the past two years, there have been negotiations on the organisation of flight training for Kauhava Airport and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Ministry of Defence Permanent Secretary Arto Rädy, among others.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing the reception centre in principle, but about the planned location in the former garrison area being wrong.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre matter last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concern over the management of the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the ultimate issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the issue of NATO was also touched on in discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closes for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia is told that the aim is to manage the operations of the airports with the help of superiors during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checkpoints and other service points.
Demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars from around 9:30am to 2pm.
No cars are allowed from the direction of Mannerheimintie to Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers in full Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Tram and Metro staff association told STT about it last night.
Most starters close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday's protest will also cause disruption to Posti's services.
There are significant delays in the delivery of e.g. day mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transports are handled despite the strike.
Efforts are also being made to treat meal deliveries, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information on the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of Finland's Alkos will close its doors for two hours on Friday.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery trade workers to take part in a protest by trade unions.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with a supervisor if necessary.
According to Kesko, it is not yet known whether individual stores could be closed.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
Day care centres in Helsinki will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to protests by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in day care centres and playgrounds will not be organised.
24-hour day care centers and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to announce further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let's see.
We're going to use this channel tonight," Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio talk to citizens.
This set of issues that we are talking about is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at Yle Arena.
SIPILÄ takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's televised speech will not tell of a more general introspection of the government.
Is the aim to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into one's own hands and to refuse the question formulations of the public debate? ponders Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
Reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow himself to be defined by it.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not announcements in a democracy.
By definition, it is the job of the media representatives to try to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken as given.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more available today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or the general policy.
Sneaky bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what he is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
Kuutti says that the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this way he can bring out his own point of view without any gravel sounds.
This will get the message across to the general public without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipila bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret something about the speech because no more specific questions can be asked.
Kuutt says it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether he's sweating, whether his hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than it would be if the government were to inform on something, because here the person is talking directly to the other person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and his associates do regularly.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
It has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister thus wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
Workers' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes on Friday against the government's actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chairperson of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
THE BOY IS FOUND AND FINE, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play around four in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was not contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disillusioned by violent fad among young people: You create hate
Kurdish-based fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted the video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street fighting by young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and came to Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of mixed martial arts.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the fad of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ones on the ground, sit on the top of the other one, and punch blindly without thinking about any of these consequences of what happens when you make videos like this.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and native Finnish youth.
Especially the fact that you fight in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come in quite outrageous numbers.
A little difficult, boys, just to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long time guests here.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the victim of someone's racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You make me hate you, which I don't like either.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you're not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Chairman of SAK Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff central organisation STTK said it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
SAK chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter sparingly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not good enough for SAK.
Sipilä previously broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the goal of a five-percent productivity leap.
Comment: Major protest threatens to slump - "It feels a little funny to be thrashing your fist"
After all, it feels a little funny to thrash your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospheres vary from one employee camp to the next.
Is the intention to shout the government down, or is it to agree with it after all?
On Monday, SAK's union leaders burst into holy anger at the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the Akavas as well.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened the closure of schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK staff centre organisation, appeared conciliatory.
He said that he kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) as a five-percent productivity leap.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hastened to announce that his paperwork is already ready.
At first there was no sound from the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the union leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Eventually, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK was looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a common proposal among wage earners, SAK should be inclined to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a goal.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has good relations with Sipilä's government.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the centrist prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola characterized the government's trade union expertise as improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit of momentum away from the Finnish halters, whose frontman is Marko Piirainen of the ACP (sd).
It feels a little funny to have a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, the spokesman of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the spokesman of the Russian Duma, thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July solemn meeting in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union sanctions list to come to the meeting - an issue that the President could remind journalists of.
In our estimation, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without a hitch, so Naryshkin continued to pin Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (kok), the leader of the meeting, in Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
The Clave Meets a Real Playoff Troll: "Paints Tight"
Tappara and Clave continue the bull days in Hakametsä today, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual goal celebrations in Hakametsä today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to pick up a 3-2-continuing time win over KalPa.
The rise was masculine, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
Tuesday of the lock was more minor win.
The guest of the Blues, who started their game tangled, was round zero points, and the defeat figures were also 2-3.
Tough game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lukko attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setups on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rauma people.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has dropped from the final series of the Clave in the semifinals.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been claimed for the settlement.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three chests and passed.
With the exception of the goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday get flute duty today.
With Tappara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of View: A Miserable Play in Progress
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put up a fight for heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
The nameless and wooden-handed casserole progressed to the SM finals to everyone's astonishment in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the silver won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season's novel works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager for Aces has built a pot pile on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating up guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are credited with something other than disc gameplay.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has called Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is in Rocky, written by Toivola, as clumsy a lead actor as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no Rocky in Iron Rock other than the nickname.
The game philosophy of Rautakallio does not include rushing and petty pigging.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's one thing to play hard, it's another to play pig.
Last season, Aces' Garret Stafford tackled Tapparan Jere Karjalainen on the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don't accept that kind of game and it doesn't belong in the ace hockey," Rautakallio snarled after the game to the People of Satakunta.
The team of the Aces this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, there are veterans, there are cops, there are bullies.
There are practically no key players in the best age of play.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about the skills gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the past season have an impact on purchases and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smoldering beneath the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio is reportedly interested in joining Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses in a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I play the mother of a friend of my husband's in the movie.
In a way it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot in the past, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, about the early years of Apulanta, is that of drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Cricket cheers and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to play.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have grown much closer.
They have met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different corners of their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really dreary.
There was a pretty small chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuuka from her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do parents really know what you were up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's infamous skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At best, he could have been secretly enamored.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that a big joint project doesn't scare her.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot for a month in Heinola.
True, a couple who live in Iiti often also plan to drive home for the night for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play film ever made in Finland with a budget of €17 million.
Previously, Finland's most expensive film title has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is in the making, will also go past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
A huge budget doesn't scare me.
I have been sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone on the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he told Iltalehti.
Originally, the budget for the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story too.
However, the film could be crammed into 100 million, because every angle of view and effects is so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's no slack.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent on Wednesday.
The final rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green, and Vladimir Burlakov.
Jerk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' fronts have recently been adorned with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or T-shirt sign was seen as somewhat of a jerk.
But times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the everyday fashion, where trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as if as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic collegium, a sweatpants shirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet is put on, in front of which the manufacturer's logo is displayed.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' recognizable track sweatpants, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback in street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the underpants that are starting to twinkle at the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's fall blouses makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your dress?
Russian politician released proof: I didn't get stuck for hours in a tank hatch!
Allegedly, a special incident had taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held presenting products from the Russian military industry.
In recent days, Russian media have been spreading colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations was forced to remove the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking through the hatch of an armored vehicle in a pretty good mood, and at least from those photos it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov, a former professional soldier himself, explained that he admired Russia's new technology at the exhibition.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next show I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside, and I came out.
I am tall and robust, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank happened," he told the radio station Russkaya sluzhba novostei.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photos of the alleged jam have been published, despite a total of 50,000 people attending the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a Bloknot.ru story in which Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank hatch while trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition shared their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers quickly jumping out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said the exhibition's coordinator, Aleksandr Pisarevsky, to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite of bloggers.
The 1962 candelabra by the architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks like it was designed today.
The cube-like steel frame is like a work of art, and it was.
The architect brothers are known to have honed the shape of the candelabra for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the lords.
Kubus candles are manufactured by the family business By Lassen, which upholds the design heritage of the renowned brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one candle versions, in four different colours.
Kubu is available in black, white, nickel and copper.
The candelabra is topical right now and is suitable for a wide range of homes.
It has been a favorite of interior bloggers in particular lately.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pond into the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to repair the leak.
The pool contains foaming process neutralized tailings and purified process water.
In general, water is either pumped for reuse as process water or discharged through a surface drainage field into the environment as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during an inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures in the pool.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland's country report, published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed throughout the treaty system as well as unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
The IMF's assessment has a lot to say about the government's actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of caution about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Taloussanomat.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF is forecasting economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects this year's growth to be zero in its new business cycle forecast.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic about this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported a small increase in total production in the summer, Kuoppamäki notes.
Less attention may have been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was brought up as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda to Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is seen as taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it doesn't eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country are disappearing each year.
This has been reported by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants are disappearing in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Superintendent of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear "under country" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications for unaccompanied minors were made in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it becomes clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more tempting for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were subject to a decision of lapse due to the fact that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who came alone.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers are not yet available this year, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well.
What about those who have received a decision to convert?
Are they also disappearing into the "dark labour market", for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the decisions on proselytism, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants to the country.
He has taken action on the matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the meeting of EU interior ministers, announced practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the equipment
The equipment used for TV and radio productions by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells devices at Huuto.net, which were once among the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological advances.
In the digital media world, no more television programs are filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is such old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move out of his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what items are being discarded.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will not return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to break down worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend the force action in connection with Friday's protest.
The original plan was to halt metro and tram traffic only for a demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it is decided whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big on the field.
The cuts in night and shift supplements are hurting drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the extras are met with opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area is virtually at a standstill.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the designated stations.
According to HSL data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
ACP members are absent from work from 3 a.m. on Friday to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by a supervisor, HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo reckons.
Repo says HSL will not be able to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employers' organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, the AP news agency reports.
According to Sky News, the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at Texas school after teacher thought self-made watch was bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought the self-made clock he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the watch looked just like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation finally ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, police had stated that the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain roars - Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Criticism from the right-wing press has also been echoed by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour party.
This has offended the public," Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's commemoration commemorated the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the Labour ranks.
Especially among MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn advocates unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament for the first time today as party leader during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted last week about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families," the prime minister tweeted in his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder remains unclear - the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns at the school about the children's absence.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead in various parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitari is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune on a social media site for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short reported that the site has four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, in the fact that the Short family bought a lofty house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
He had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various prep courses, for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's site, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri served cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented cheerfully on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loiri, Korpi, the trainer of the success horse, gets full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri ruffled.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The greatest athlete's donation of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
Subban, 26, is also committed to helping the hospital with other fundraisers for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadian players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among other things, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife at the Japanese cafe for the evening - serve the food with just a bikini and an apron on
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hali café and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the company sick, and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
At the Ore no Yome cafe in Tokyo, you can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "spouse" is chosen from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is faced with nothing but apron and bikinis, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the wife candidates regarding their height and weight, always to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon, 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against car security began to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a press release published by Intel.
The Board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections with the aim of standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report in the future based on ASRB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars," said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish safety best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford announced the RS data now that the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-wheel-drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from 0 to 100 with a top speed of 266 km/h thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine.
Also interesting for Finns is the price, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford says in a statement.
Favorite brand Kia introduced two novelties at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
Of the two novelties in Finland, the new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly more important, with which Kia intends to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created in the form of a new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, Sportage is rounder than before.
A centimeter has come to the wheelbase and outside dimensions here and there, and the car splits the air more efficiently than before.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo, which develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are told closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat reached our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels, and higher-end equipment.
To begin with, Optimos with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine will be available.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
Around the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima station wagon begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - banged in a bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is part of the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a showy, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer star.
The ensemble is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
The singer, who became a mother during the three-year hiatus, has been able to shed the pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn't really excite me.
I miss all the music related stuff, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release their new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Astonishes Again, Now Shows Chest
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after the other.
She shows off her pregnancy belly and chest braces generously in sexy clothes, the last time last night at one o'clock American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left a gig with husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
As the flash lights flash, it reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity outfit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when there was a pregnancy belly on the show.
The hard laws of the modeling world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the notion that the modeling world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Talking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their minds about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled the six hard truths of Leloup from behind the scenes.
Each season starts from scratch.
Even if you had posed in top designer outfits in the previous season, the new season starts with castings again.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry competing for jobs with veterans.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take up to a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to drop some pounds, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks end, the difference is sore.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but what gnaws at them is that everyone thinks the job is just showing off clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But in the work of the model can also express itself.
Models at the Tory Burch show yesterday.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Week, where designers will unveil their collection for next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
In the film based on the early years of Apulanta, Roope Salminen plays the band's founding member Antti Lautala.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I am soon to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I play a 16-year-old guitarist.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to impersonate a human being.
The man who runs the band Scrooge Salminen and Dogs will not leave the role.
Punk mannerisms come naturally to a man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many saw a foretaste, as well if you've ever been to one of our shows.
Our performance has never been anything small-minded, but we always go full-on.
The main cast of the 1993-2004 film Teit us beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta, was announced today.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is played by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming job as early as last night, when he told Snapchat he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture on Instagram of his new look, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen on his mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face smooth, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force it, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Smaller children should be protected, not, for example, allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can linger in the mind and be distressed, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news images of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing up.
It is a good idea to discuss the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
It is not a good idea to frighten a child unnecessarily, even if you are distressing and frightening yourself.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to bring up the issue with them if the child is wondering about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how this will be handled in our family.
After all, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety when possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.

Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Ball lightning hitting Vermo hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone Apila's Pallolasama into a fierce blow in midsummer.
It only ran for wins and second place until at the end of July, the Tampere races experienced a collapse.
Since the stallion was thoroughly frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with his protégé from the vet.
An explanation for the blackout was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medicine to defeat it.
As Clover's ball lightning had to be light exercise, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku in its record time after Taruntuuli.
The clover ball flash was very under pressure from the break, as it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a slight deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good race made the stallions sharp.
The horse's tone certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have leveled off as well.
Clover's ball lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it's not amused, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has had such a lightning strike that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, the competitors are no match for the ball lightning, which even gives off warm-blooded rides.
In the North's wishes there is a nest run in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Clover's Ball Lightning agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure and you might even go under the boom of the starting car and stuff like that.
Hopefully, the stallion will be calmer than it was when we left.
While in shape, Clover's ball lightning can also come from the bow, and we will start driving it for the win, the coach promises.
This Is Why You Can't Get Rid of Unnecessary iPhone Programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may be able to be uninstalled sometime in the future - but not quite all of them.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone has a number of apps that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation eased to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or 0.1 per cent year-on-year, Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority, reported today.
The price increase was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper than a year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent as prices fell.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus sign according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Euro area inflation is still persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a price increase of around 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed next to try to tighten monetary policy
The U.S.'s next recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, starts raising interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession could hit at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market price shock before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they used to - and if they react to the Fed's extortion of the money taps the way they used to.
Such conclusions have been reached by German bank Deutsche Bank's London Market Research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its major international customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or a different model than at the time of previous interest rate hikes - and what the consequences might be.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not even be a year
The leaders, who decide on the Fed's monetary policy and its respective tuning, have been hinting all through the summer and early autumn that the time is ripe for interest rates to be raised.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years may occur as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rate increases of 0.25 percentage points, from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended exactly two years ago.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, severe adversity in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically occurred since previous Fed rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and more severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have been sifting through the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and financial market reversals since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
They report on the Fed's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the first rate hike has been less than a year, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of the Fed's rate hikes.
The Fed has successively raised and lowered its key interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has deviated in some respects from the others, and the multiplier is relatively sparse in the review, so it is unlikely to make any definite conclusions about the effects of the next rate hikes.
As the strategy points out, this time a lot is different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be undisputedly discovered even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are somewhat undisputedly clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, while growing the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated over the decades in different parts of the financial and real economy, and already too high, became even larger as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in economic history to date.
3) In most areas of financial markets, the crazily cheap debt financing, which was almost contained in the financial economy in particular, inflated the largest price bubbles in economic history to date, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Even so, there is hardly much dispute that the financial markets, which had risen to ever more complex levels of leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed up interest rates.
Financial structures based on debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted no longer than their time after interest rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give an idea by mentioning things such as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been as cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now, in different parts of the economy, there is a heavier debt load than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) Liquidity from central banks, which has become more frequent and cheaper, has mostly remained in the financial markets and has pushed key asset and security classes to their most expensive levels since the peak before the financial crisis or ever.
Not only do strategists lax the mood with warning signs from the financial markets, but they also point out that not even the U.S. economy has yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the pattern it has seen in the past.
The Eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks in the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next begins to tighten its money taps more tightly.
Perhaps the future image of Albert Edwards, a strategist at the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for some time coached the bank's international investor clients in the following turnarounds of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted at HP's corporate services, the company says.
HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will focus on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which will focus on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) on the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
Consumer-side reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
Just the other year, its three most significant customers accounted for 65% of operating profit.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system for iPhone after Apple update release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation, when a "Software update failed" error message appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst rush hour pass or try to update via iTunes.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may include removing apps to get status, but Apple has reduced the chance of this by reducing the size of the update and also made the process easier with a new tool that suggests apps to remove and then reinstalls them as the update is completed.
It is a good idea to make sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the update so that the battery does not run out.
If the charge level is too low, Apple won't let the update progress, as if the battery runs out, it could result in the update breaking.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the Board of Directors of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is about the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice for membership in May this year.
I checked and it's enough that I've filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company is used to manage the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, following the merger, on the Board of Directors of Kährs and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings go through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to see to it that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg-based holding company ready for the holdings.
A reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents starting at 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre at the former Rescue College property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK prepares alternative working life blackmail package
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package to the government's tightening of working life.
The organisation also hopes to involve other employee centre organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of lowering the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola remarked during a break in the organization's administration meeting to reporters.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, is not prepared for discussions.
Economists at STTK have calculated that the change security included in the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package will cost the employer EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if you're on the side of one to a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, cutting Sunday supplements is a painful place for the staff central organisation STTK.
The organization requires the government to back down from the coercive legislation with which it would be implementing some of the extortion.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that an alternative package would be prepared with the SDP, which had the issue on the table.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75%, and holidays will be reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited wage earners to the demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava's Fjäder thanks
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now align with Akava, as Akava has long been outlining an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join him in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier on Wednesday that they were preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a five percent competitive jump by the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Sture Fjäder, chairman.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that works for the government and employers in the country," Fjäder says.
Akava's Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
University of Tampere Green Left Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar previous speech by the Prime Minister, one must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operators' strike with a televised speech.
Monologue, monarchist vibes
All day long, Sipilä's speech has attracted criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chair of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Greens, "there has already been a monologue.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist sentiment: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for presenting the Sipilä speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications at Yle News.
Like us in the time of the oaks
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
Mom puts on a prettier kolt and Dad puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, we'll be quiet in front of the TV like we used to be in the days of the Oaks," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Will Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who are drafting amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they must cut back when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It has published the accompanying bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living on debt, and team spirit in the evening?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western nations rejected Russia's proposal to oust Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abdicate, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan by which al-Assad would have stepped down from power in style after some time.
However, Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points of the plan for him in the bilateral discussion: no weapons were allowed to be used against the opposition, there had to be an immediate voice contact between the opposition and Assad, and Assad's abdication had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all issues, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment.
Ahtisaari says he relayed Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are not two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any deal that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East section of the British Foreign Office, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's remarks because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under the authority of Moscow.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have responded that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power with some supporter of Assad.
The flow of refugees is our own doing
During the negotiations Ahtisaari had killed about 7,500 people in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Centre for Asylum Seekers in Tornio
The Asylum Seekers' Settlement Centre, planned by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty building of the Tornio shared lyceum in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-chairman of Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not in session and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specifies to STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the debate.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on that, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and reacted quickly.
The joint lyceum would accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipila still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre), the halving of holiday money in public would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of labour sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the work-related extortion announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course gladly accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's opinion, halving the holiday pay would be a way of working, because it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday bonuses.
Labour market organisations could mutually agree on a cut in holiday bonuses, as these are recorded in collective agreements instead of legislation.
With this in mind, the Government will report to Parliament on working life blackmails on Wednesday next week in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work then starts, meaning that the train is moving and it is getting more and more difficult.
There's plenty of time now.
It won't be long, if there is a will to do so.
The list released by the government last week includes the conversion of Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75%, and holidays will be reduced.
The reforms are implemented as coercive legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Due to the actions, the trade union organisations are holding a large-scale demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approved the expansion of the mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but somewhat murmuringly approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, i.e. the storage facility of the sap hall.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than was originally discussed.
Busy schedule as well.
It was also a bit of a surprise that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment program, but the money will be decided later on in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between €150,000 and €200,000 on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at €300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board eased its previous sharp stance on bringing street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of fostering Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language in, for example, information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language is also worth being open-minded about now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of these can be used for a variety of marketing purposes in the province.
Termination of train connections cuts the province's vitality
Cuts in train connections hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether people can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been discussed several times.
It is important for the province as a whole that our chances of survival are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these shutdowns on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Rector Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor accessibility also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult, because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siu's war
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel sound among them.
City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the photo) proposed to abandon the whole project at the board meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed as unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although one train pair will be fewer.
There will be changes to passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train inning is missed, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money for rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely closed.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck off.
The rescue services released a 12-year-old who had climbed up the roof and was unable to get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
That did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others snuck out of the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to the scene to help with a draft ladder to safely return the last one left on the roof to the ground.
FedEx operating profit twofold, lowers outlook for fiscal year 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results in its latest quarter, with the delivery giant cutting its full-year profit forecast, driven by weaker demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its stock fell about 2.5 percent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. says it expects next May to end the tax year with a result of $10.40 to $10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet poll.
The lower outlook came despite average price increases of 4.9%, effective January 4, and despite higher surcharges for heavy or large parcels on land starting in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue growing from the previous year as they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "will perform stably given the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for pay for the holiday were announced a day after rival UPS reported that it plans to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, about the same amount it did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx's earnings were $692 million, an increase of 6% over last year.
Profit per share came to $2.42, which falls short of the $2.44 average forecast. The survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decline in international priority transportation in recent years, which has halted the development of its Express unit's revenue.
However, the rise of e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the country unit's revenue increased by 29 per cent, but the revenue from operations was basically the same due to the high costs of bigger packages and own insurance.
The Express unit's revenue was better due to higher base charges, while the operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labor costs.
At the opening auction, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 percent down for this year and 17 percent below its June 11 record.
U.S. central bank policymakers are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide if it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the central bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the nation's financial interests above everything else.
Congress has laid two kinds of responsibility on the shoulders of the central bank: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, central bankers have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
It is this third requirement that may be the deciding factor in the decision to be announced on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the record-breaking incentive brought about by the near-zero short-term interest rate level since late 2008.
While most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made already-precarious central bank officials even more spooky when it comes to increasing volatility. There is a fear of what would be the impact if the federal funds rate reference value were to be raised by at least a percentage point per quarter.
"Understandably, the labor market and inflation are the first and most important issues to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief financial expert at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for maintaining interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid enough reason to wait yet," he says.
No agreement has been reached on the Central Bank's decision, which, too, creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the drawdown, as the key indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This refers to a decline in the securities market if the central bank increases the level, unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next drawdown will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery was brought about by the expectation that the central bank would keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief economics expert for Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If policymakers raise interest rates, "they'll have to put a lot of effort into their policy to support the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets as it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it appeared that the central bank would this month be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to what the central bank considers the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of picking up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, central bank policymakers say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "survives higher interest rates and also needs them given the tight labour market situation," says Ian Shepherdson, chief economics expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared China's slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10 percent below its peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and recent weeks of coverage of China's economic weakness, policymakers would tighten the level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
He now predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.
"The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear and they have little information at their disposal as to the consequences of the events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the international economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been immense.
In 2013, the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, hinted that the central bank could "tighten" the increase in the amount of money, causing upheavals in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," states Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, remarked this month that "the central bank has in the past overreacted to financial market movements that seem to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth," says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritize financial stability during the Great Crisis, as Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, said in a statement.
The latest turmoil comes nowhere near its level, Posen says.
"Nobody wants to be in a situation where there is a fear of raising interest rates because the market is upset," says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention financial stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Pediatric Association in Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatrics Association (SPRS) has found a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts painted with descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, new research suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect a child's immune system.
Seven channel's Sunrise show is a favorite in viewership, despite Nine channel's attempts to report on executive disclosure on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader revelation failed to increase Today's viewership.
Nine Channel's morning show was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The rival show Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international broadcasts that also covers Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance didn't seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as the average viewership for Sunrise was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 for Today.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday's (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has captured Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far in September, the Sunrise average is 349,000 viewers, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The changes are blowing this morning not only in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news on Seven was the 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which garnered a rather impressive 1.219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the driving force behind the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had a twofold fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new game show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) reached 623,000 viewers - a small enough victory for Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat show (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewership averaged 520,000, and the second half-hour had a whopping 720,000.
The Hot Seat average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night average drop in viewership gives Nine the confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire.

The final three agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed who will win The Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up dating in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a clue as to the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finale
All three women became poetic about how Wood is a perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as the reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?", their answers may have provided a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly cited Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked in the house, the energies of (Sarah) and Sam felt quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have questioned him since his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose to join the San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first kickback as the team beat Minnesota Tuesday by 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayne to return the next kick and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true character was also evident in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new recruits a batsman in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a plane kick taken by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of play
This was certainly not the start that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for on his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on the way from the field after the drop, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when a pass in his own end zone led to a Queensland goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airstrip.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his efforts to support democracy were curtailed.
4 killed as police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the country's new constitution proposal, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior official in the area, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to have killed but are traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution will undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group calls for a state of its own.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have voted this week on the constitutional draft clauses in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60% chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde group of islands, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front, halfway between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast center added.
Google Launches Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of the announcement being made by a manager, from his own personal experience, Google employee Rita Masoud wrote, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations are received by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it will match every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to Syria's four-year civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people out of their homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Weight-loss surgery may help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get the mortality data," Dr. Robin Blackstone states. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
For weight loss, or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of people surveyed have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
A BMI, or weight-to-length ratio, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If a BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is above 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut individuals fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of people treated by means other than surgery remained roughly the same at 29.
Of those who were operated on, 36% had a complete and 28% partial improvement in diabetes.
By comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, as well as the "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgery group," the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Hemoglobin A1c levels after surgery dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved "glycemic control" described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the mean results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the group undergoing gastric reduction surgery, the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), lowered their BMI more (7.4 and 5.1), lowered their hemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent respectively), and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7 percent respectively).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin says that while the study does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people undergoing weight-loss surgery had a 29% lower chance of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study shows no improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging for individuals with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"Research results are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for the lower BMI group," and is not associated with an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take their weight very seriously when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has amassed these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of the whole of humanity should be put before the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we are forced to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The bottom line is to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response by the United States caused a chain of violent events.
"After the 9/11 attack, in a letter, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the ingestion of hand sanitizer by children has increased fourfold
Poison data centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in the ingestion of heavily alcoholic hand sanitizer in children under the age of 12 since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Data Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Information Center, cases of disinfectant ingestion reported to poison information centers for children under the age of 12 rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are more likely to be interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some want to impress their friends or meet the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a cheap riser.
According to reports, teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant disinfectant scents can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand sanitizers) are ones with an added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
A hand sanitizer can contain anything from 45% to 95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few squirts are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, the head of the Center for Poisoning Information at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So please don't leave a whiskey shot lying on the table, but hand sanitizer is left in plain sight, and if kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed just four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult drunk-driving limit, says emergency room physician Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah mossed as he spoke and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health officials assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was reported as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "wicked" teacher by spreading bacterial poison in the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and forbade it from his class.
The police consider the thwarted plan to be "loose talk" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor mill: Celtic has no conflicts
Griffiths downplays talk of Celtic's conflicts, and Deila admits Hoops is in a tight spot, but he makes it turn
Hearts fights against the Scottish Football Association on Neilson's charges, and Warburton is wary of January's recruits that could disrupt team unity
Dons increased his lead to Celtic by five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and allowed the team to increase the gap to Celtic by five points.
Griffiths downplays talk of contradictions
There have been rumors about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately overtook them. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team is preparing to face the Dutch league leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
Lack of Scottish Championship Tires the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said, "The Netherlands no longer shows the highlights of Celtic games, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here just can't stand to talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and non-Scotlanders also like to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting drop from the Champions League was quickly followed by a loss to Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who are now at the top of the series by a five-point margin to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes in the past, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
So are we, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard against January player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January player moves, he is wary of recruiting frenzy, asserting that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, there is a pre-season adjustment period, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's Michu Suggests Retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is attached to the transfer window to Celtic, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans expires.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and failed to find a new club outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts ready to fight Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later overturned, and this was already the third red card convicted by Collum in the last eight months that was overturned.
Neilson stands by his statement, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a spur of the moment," the attacker said, adding, "I think it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I then move on to playing for Celtic."
Tannadice Board of Directors believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the weakening of the players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted with 'ugly victory' in Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, hung desperately in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to reach their seventh consecutive league win thanks to Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick, which put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's a trophy or a league that hasn't won games this way as well."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as UK total rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistical Institute (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment is now 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74% during the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
During these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
If there is no judicial intervention, I will watch the man be executed later today.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the audience's gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I have begun to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to watch executions in America, and since there are often more applications than available seats, participants are selected through a gruesome draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen will look cool at the event.
I can't do it.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own connection to him through calls made over the months and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
All I have to do is try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that he "could have laid out his words better," but he still feels that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I've told him he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the anti-death penalty trend.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is at my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I will not go through all the details again here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would in any case make him guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe it is wrong to execute him.
And this is the perspective from which I watch him die.
I cannot claim to be completely impartial.
There will be other journalists there to take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police chase
Canning Vale's constable stayed dry when he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A man from Perth's attempt to distract the police from their heels went awry when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres away from a policeman who was trying to "leniently lure him back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading for the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "a proper police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins, the champion footballer, is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a blowout and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his attempt, but inspired locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody Claims Officials Tried to Spy on Him and Threatens to Stop Competing
Peter Moody has claimed that officials at Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate his stables last year, and threatens to stop racing immediately.
He accuses the officials and Racing Victoria's Integrity Division, claiming they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection due to a care measure taken on the day of the race was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has found himself in an awkward situation after Lidar's inexplicable positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check on spy allegations for a year and a half, and did not want "it to look like envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that everything unravels at once," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm sleeping well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start to think differently, then I don't have to continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he reported that the integrity department had attempted to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I name him when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he cared about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, of course they should fire their lawyers, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the issue at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps shift the responsibility beyond the coaches to what is going on in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now will possibly make them think just that.
But I'm at a point now where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really saddens me.
I'm putting pressure on them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-term Lidarin cobalt research, and a late rejection led him to state that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of race day management "ridiculous" after putting a mud or clay bath at the feet of the horse, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud in its leg.
It could have had a poultice last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban due to the race day's poultice care, which officials began an investigation into.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver arrested
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic break after running into a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he sustained serious injuries when a car collided with him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man, Nathalia, reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failing to provide assistance, and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL rugby league champions' claims that his team's tackles were part of the "lineup".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm to "wrestle" on their side when it unexpectedly won the final qualifier in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up his reference to Stormi after winning the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final qualifier. Bennett called the game a rugby league "show window" and said the two Queensland teams were "not very enthusiastic" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they just focus on "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by criticism of the two leading coaches, as it means they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year long, and in the last six weeks, we've just been emphasizing contact in tackles, and that's what's made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a bit of a shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that the Bennett-trained St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought that side out in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between the Storms and the Roosters was richer in points than that between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is that exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense and failing to score a goal?
For me, this is about alignment.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is off duty this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for the pre-finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man with $200,000 bail for drug charge
A man facing a possible life sentence for attempted possession of 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 pounds of the drug to a Solay yacht that entered South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting the other defendants at the marina all morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 pounds of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic faces a possible life sentence for attempted possession of cocaine for business purposes, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic was trying to hold the entire amount, and that he may have been in the cafe for entirely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close ties with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting a $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily, and upholds his curfew between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for photos of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to an online communication service, where Hogg received numerous obscene pictures of children sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found the shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five pictures, searched the computers on the scene, and found "worrying" web searches with keywords used to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the internet before he "pretends to be a police officer to scare them".
Eilidh Robertson, a fiscal discharge representative, told the Sheriff Court in Dundee, "He said it was an addiction - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had performed the searches on the computer but said that they had only been done because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, he's sick in the head, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she was yelling at her mother, shaking and crying.
The mother saw the obscene pictures on the phone and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, a 23-year-old living on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking pictures of immoral children on June 14 of last year. He broke his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear in court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered in the sex offenders register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal delayed the sentence until October to give the Social Services time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before trial.
He was added to the sex offenders register before the day of sentencing.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe gives wrong speech to parliament
Earlier this year, Africa's oldest leader, Mugabe, fell down the stairs leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with interjections as he gave a State of the Country address to Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the members involved that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they step out, parliamentary immunity would not apply.
The overseer of group discipline said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the corporate services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from the faster-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in costs, starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructurings will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and CEO, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help businesses transition to a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual revenue will be over $50 billion, and it will "focus on delivering unparalleled integrated technology solutions" to businesses," the company said in a statement.
The division splits up the company, which was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto, called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second-largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its distribution is the latest in an industry based on the belief that tightly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb tie
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation is going according to plan, there is no reason why he should not be playing again by Christmas.
Even in this best-case scenario, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in next summer's European Championships.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return mid-season, there is always a risk of further injury.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in the formation.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd. show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has only played 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the past five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's larger ensemble after the 2007-08 season, in six out of eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe their improvement in injury statistics over the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when recovering from an injury can be a prone season when you need to strengthen your body and get some competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal start their Champions League game Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then play Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain a balance and give a break to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favourite to Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday night by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar descriptions do not exist in the series, especially given that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and young men's suicide rates higher than they have in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK, and is three times more common among men than women.
In an attempt to tackle the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Men. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. The study found that a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were "in a healthy mood".
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was halved if they had sane friends.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available first.
In this age of social media communication, style goes beyond content and the immediacy of response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, joyful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - inner yearning for personal growth and friendship - that affect our mental health more deeply.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get any greater happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
Not a single character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which stood out clearly in interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, although they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a volunteer at Samaritans explained to me: "Listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I've really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often, men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "getting over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival options.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, outside position on the other end of the phone helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations have been redesigned to celebrate, why not take your friends out for coffee at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends are broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, take part in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG overtake Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes in his Champions League debut, showing the French league champions the way, but the team missed several chances before finally increasing their head start as Cavan hit the goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champions, as the game was not only an extension but also an improvement on their quarter-finals leading games in the final three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, as Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and was later replaced from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in the statistics, and it's a good start, although there are things we'll have to hone this season," Blanc said.
This predicts good.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we did not manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after an injury in one of three changes made after the team was tied in a 2-2 Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux over the weekend, but he was eclipsed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran Marco Verratt's pass behind the Malmö defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the net.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It beat Celtic in the decision-making match when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players in the deep midfield.
But on the offensive side, the team offered little more than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which barely passed Kevin Trapp's goalpost.
Instead, PSG occasionally got into trouble due to missed passes and poor finish, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed a total of five attempts in the first half alone and was subsequently disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the start of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in pre-work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent out a twist kick that tilted around the goalpost at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour after the game thanks to Cavan, the Uruguayan who hit his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had tapped forward Maxwell's cross pass from the left.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back in the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's straight kick kept the final numbers down before Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the exchange was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level higher than his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I take my hat off to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which suffered a crash in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, reported in a notification that it had sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with plummeting commodity prices as China's slowdown puts a strain on demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The new entry raised the value of Glencore shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trades.
Shares rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had disclosed a $2.5 billion stock deal the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold new share capital for 125 pence a share, which meant a 2.4% reduction in Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth a total of 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over the long-term slowdown in Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a statement from the White House on Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and will be in response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will allow us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on numerous global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, and at the same time it will allow President Obama and President Xi to discuss constructively issues where there are disagreements," the statement added.
During a visit that was first announced in February, Xi is also expected to stop by Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with numerous U.S. technology leaders before continuing toward New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of controversial topics, including Washington's concern over China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon dismisses differences in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On the HBO Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it's taken into account when choosing actors for the film, not the series," Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacted incredulously to the injured, commenting, "Oh! Wow. Okay," while the comments of The Martian's actor were left hanging in the air.
Other producers, Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers, joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series' finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the start.
The only dark figure is a hooker hit by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People insisted on the film's directing rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon bluntly replied that their directorship "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was aired, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing, "Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
Since its release, Tweeting has garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discourse.
After white police killed teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and called on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement as presenting the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter leaders recently released a statement to answer Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers, and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met with the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
On Monday, professional rock climber and tableware collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and receive the $1 million top prize.
Just after the end of its seventh season, there has never been a competitor who has survived all sections of the program's obstacle course.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
In the last mission, you had to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and completed the challenge on time, making her the first athlete ever to complete the exhausting 4th leg of the American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock for winning the million-dollar grand prize.
"After all, it's great to think about this when I've never made or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden...I can't even imagine what this will be like...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten doesn't get more commission money, despite being the first ever contestant to successfully pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets to the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes lives, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels resentment for that.
He's just so happy he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for season eight, with filming to begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their role of a prankster perfectly on Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get half a game away from the Houston Astros in a race for another American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word for at least one night, which had been very hard to reach for most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how you get them," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit made the run three times in the first two innings, and then once in the sixth and once again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 in 1/3 innings and let off three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending to this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changeling to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute striker Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, his first since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since hitting the Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked significantly better in batting practice and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance to get back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton started the inning by hitting out twice on the left field line.
On the right-hand side, Aaron Hicks made his way home with a tap of one of the bases, and Simon was able to directly burn second baseman Brian Dozier before Simon was traded for left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against, ahead of rookie substitute striker Miguel Sano, who pulled a two-bay run to the left of right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a leveling runner on second base, VerHagen got third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the goal leading to a double game.
It was a major league record: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had a backup run at the start of the ninth, Mauer pulled two beaten runs against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth save.
In the beginning, Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the injured list before the game after being away for over a month due to a lower back infection.
"It's obvious I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I got some nice passes done in the third inning."
After Hughes grabbed the starter for the first base, he let second base player Ian Kinsler advance one-on-one.
J.D. Martinez's walk on the right side in a two-fire situation brought Victor Martinez to bat, who took himself to first base with a midfield stroke and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 streak while runners were in good running positions.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos went on to hit right and cause a second run, but the menacing situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned as he tried to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second inning and received one fire, a two-bay situation from running catcher James McCann and two fires, a one-bay situation from running center Anthony Gose, after which the score was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began pitching and pitched a runless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed follower A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs out of six strokes and a walk on four fires.
ATTENTION: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was thrown away due to a shoulder strain.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez' shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder pullout, but was due to return Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris's record in the Tigers is 1-1 in four starts since left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to a right slanted abs sprain.
The Tigers and Twins' three-game series ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy needs to open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to steer the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the group leading the deepening of general reform.
Supporting openness while pushing ahead with reforms will add new momentum and vitality, and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, relaxation of border control principles, urging state-owned companies to seize private capital, and revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list is created, identifying the sectors and companies in which investments are not allowed.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a law-based business environment, and makes the market more transparent.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to run their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation, as well as new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open government-controlled sectors to private financiers, more sectors will open up.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for foreign permanent resident permits, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional practice rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also attended the meeting, according to a statement released after the meeting.
