Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane to a home win in the opening - Savo Volley got another win
As many as seven times in a row, Hurrikaan-Loimaa, who had won the Men's Volleyball Championship medals, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
General player Eemeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective in the Hurricane by 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't materialize, and then a call came from Loimaa.
Things were settled pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu, supported Kouki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team chipper with a match-specific contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side as well, and that brought extra extra extra in the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but continuing the medal streak is of course the goal," Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most effective with 18 points when the team knocked the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in Vieremä.
Our game was volatile, especially at the offensive end, but luckily we were able to squeeze the win.
I certainly didn't have any conscious different charge when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in Vieremä Volleyball 3 in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere in the ceiling all the time.
A good feeling was left in the home opening.
Miro was the king, Sillikin played a good game, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielaveden Sammo while Tuovinen was the head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Mikkonen again the star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, who won the league scoring in 2012-13, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his opening win of the season after taking down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started well on its own.
Today, of course, was a close loss, as we were in the fourth period with a loss of 17-21.
A round win was dug out, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most powerful player in the finals was 28 points scorer Edwards Buivids.
Countryman Aleksandrs Kudryashovs supported with 17 points.
There was almost no way to get a grip on the guy's wood chipper, Mikkonen praised.
Finland ranked number one in the world in the comparison of human capital
Finland is at the top of the world in terms of human capital, according to the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked worst.
When measuring human capital, the education level of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched out to a great fight, and the Madrid teams' local game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish Football League.
Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid were the closest to the goal, but Belgian guard Courtois was able to repel.
Courtois played for Atletico for three seasons on loan when he was a Chelsea player.
Earlier this week, the International Football Federation (FIFA) selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale scored the best spot, but his shot was passed at the end of the goal's opening half.
Bale was replaced after a break due to a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the goalie who moved to Juventus in the match.
In the United States, abortion rights are now under attack - A powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected as one of the nine members of the Supreme Court.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn a decision known as Roe v. Wade that made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - The United States and Abortion Rights tells how the current situation has come about over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against safe abortion and received various degrees of support for it from the majority of our country's MPs.
The powerful documentary begins with gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to legal blackmail.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
The news videos are reminiscent of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
This was at a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
A consortium of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors at the time.
The reasons given by the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died from a self-made abortion is enough.
The death toll in the United States was about 5,000 a year.
The legalization of abortions was advocated by the Republican Party in particular.
As early as 1967, California's abortion rights law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign of 1980, who began to radically confuse religion with politics in order to rally voters.
His abortion rate was also reversed by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And so did Donald Trump.
To the bottom of the matter, the document reaches the bottom line in its search for the root cause of the politicization of the abortion issue.
When racially segregated religious organizations were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as the stick horse.
Religion has brought exceptional knots into politics.
At the time of writing this, there is a situation in the United States where the president, who boasted of his sexual harassment but captured the voices of the religious right on his abortion stand, has selected Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Supreme Court, who is now accused by several women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may be given the power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - large protests at border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border area on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
Two children are among the dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an airstrike in the border zone as protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says it has begun using force to prevent protesters from breaking up the border fence or trying to get to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in protests in Gaza since March, when Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
Protesters called for Palestinian families to be allowed access to areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balloons from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's top dog Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a behind tackle in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
The situation seems to have been plagued by referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
The work tasted like Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
The paedophile help service was immediately filled with bookings - in Finland about 40,000 people are experiencing interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, people who are sexually attracted to children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint project of the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood and appointment times were booked very quickly at Sexpo, which offers counselling and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference toward children is a source of embarrassment for many.
The majority of those who consider pedophile emotions themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus have not committed any criminal acts.
However, preference is usually a permanent characteristic.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life, says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist at Yle, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, the work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
U.S. President Donald Trump as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound strange at first, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites to win the award based on betting odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at speech level.
The biggest favourites to win the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and pledged to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is considerable, as it was still chilly last year.
Still, rewarding Kim, who has been nuclear-weaponized for years and leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced starting Monday, and Friday will be the most conspicuous, or peace prize.
If the award is not given to participants in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape at his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the leading expert in his field in the world.
Through his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, a gruesome byproduct of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been the United Nations Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there will be 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates will not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself would not mind if he were awarded the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world," the president continued, referring to the North Korean talks.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 2000s, the award has been given to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in tunnel: Drivers behaved like lemmings and headed in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in Lohja occurred on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring the traffic back to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it cannot be opened because there are motorists in the road all the way through shock and they drive how it happens," Pasi Kääriäinen, the firemaster on duty, told STT at the time.
At the time, the motorway was even taken the wrong way after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts working against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, says Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety Liaison Manager.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for a compelling reason.
Liikenneturva reminds that in exceptional situations, one cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Emergency vehicles must always provide as unobstructed a passage as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making and reversing a U-turn.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, where headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping for no compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
There have even been cases recently where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this kind of activity," says Heiskanen in a statement from Liikenneturva.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught at the bottom of the lake
The Ilves fans transported by the Inland Watership M/S Tampere would have liked to have stayed on board to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been caught by its bow at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's captain at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, which was on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught on the bottom of its bow at Vanajavesi in Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the crash.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until the morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the harbour and on a bus home, Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 win for Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's casualty was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
Navigation was also made more difficult by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered in log droppings, which is why its reflectors were not visible normally in the dark autumn bridge.
No more notable collision
Haveri took place on the western side of the narrow Jumunensalmi Strait shortly after the ferry route had crossed the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama in the incident, Syrjä says, as the ship's speed was very low at the time of the incident and hitting the bottom did not cause a more notable collision.
According to Syrjä, being caught at the bottom has not caused any leaks or indentations on the ship and, as a result, the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver went to inspect the condition of the ship before the ship began to be towed off the shallows.
To be sure, we will still visit the shipyard to check that there was no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise booked for M/S Tampere next weekend can be handled as agreed.
The cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No use for ambulances
The emergency services received an alert on the incident on Saturday night, just after 9:30 p.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Matti Willman, an on-duty firefighter, said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced after half past three on the night before Sunday that everyone on board has been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's Justice Candidate Charged With Harassment And Drunkenness May Not Hold Top Office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well miss the position he is seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola from the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during her studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up pretending to be someone else.
In the United States, it has happened on occasion before that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court Justice has caused a great deal of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would rain down on the Democrats' laurel
The U.S. Supreme Court tends to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the selection of a new judge has become a politically very delicate process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aaltola says the decision will likely rain down on the Democratic Party's laurel in the upcoming midterm elections in Congress.
It would raise voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, appointing a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity for appointment does not come with every presidential term, as in the United States Supreme Court justices are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request between the ages of 70 and 80.
Even some Republicans are hesitant about the nomination.
A background report on the U.S. Supreme Court nominees will normally be made, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for further investigation by the FBI, Aaltola says it can still bring up something relevant.
Yes, it might.
Rarely is there smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, it is certain, at least, that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility for the post will be discussed livelyly before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to a vote and for the Republicans to lose.
Woman identifies Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC she recognizes a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, the woman said that it was Anatoly Chepiga, who works for the military intelligence agency GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier that they had revealed one of the men suspected of poisoning as Tshepiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities are covert identities.
The BBC group travelled to a village in the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman in the village identified the young Tshepigan from the pictures published by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man in the British police photos of the man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with the Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga was awarded the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning told Russian TV in an interview earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Older people in throwing bags in the health and social services reform
Now we have a vivid example of what the health and social services reform change constraint defined by Sipilä's government means in practice.
The health and social services of my native municipality of Vaala are provided by the Oulunkaari Joint Municipal Authority, with the former regional director of Attendo appointed as its Director of Health Services in 2016.
Leaders of the municipal federation warn the council of a change constraint.
If health and social services expenditures rise now, municipal government subsidies will be cut in the future.
The municipal centre decision-makers were startled, and most of them are prepared for a major structural change in elderly care, which would put an end to institutional care and a small unit for people with memory disorders in the ward of the health centre.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages would be torn from their roots next to the health centre to be treated "at home".
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay its customers.
Vaala's left-wing did not ingest poor preparation, but organised a good public event, which attracted a lot of relatives, caregivers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with slides of health and social services preparation, how the municipality of Vaala treats the elderly the most at home already in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighboring councilman, Carina Läntinen.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it again put the Oulunkaari drafters on their hind legs.
The health and social services preparers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala that is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The rapporteurs only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it will provide or what kind of personnel structure Attendo will use to care for the elderly until the end of hospice care.
Without a nurse?
You see, the health centre's facility sites are being shut down because there is no doctor's night stand.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at the Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala's example shows how centrist officials run councillors with insufficient information and councillors are stuck with their backs against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party clears the residents of Vaala, because who will remain there as an unsafe resident if there is an opportunity to move out.
Was there one election slogan in the center that the whole country is kept populated?
Turkish President Erdogan Opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people demonstrated in Cologne, Germany, when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visiting the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the river Rhine as early as the morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read the signs of the protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during Erdogan's visit, which began on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had cordoned off a large area of the mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and felt that it strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep differences between the two countries, including on human rights issues.
Criticism surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia State Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he came to an anti-Erdogan protest from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take to the streets in Turkey.
They have been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the final stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant part of the population is of Turkish origin.
Slovakia charges three for murder of journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in an investigation into the murder, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders are linked to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of livestock in sparsely populated areas on Sunday
Due to printing fault, Sunday's Karjalainen will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas, where the distribution to the common boxes has to be carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra newspaper bundles in the province.
The magazines of the subscribers of the rest of Finland will not be mailed separately until Monday.
Distribution of these magazines is severely delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg interviews Vesa Heilala, among others, in his upcoming talk show today.
Vesa is in the studio telling about her upcoming space trip, which she booked for Virgin Galactic as early as 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which required a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight that took place in 2014 and even claimed the lives of the victims, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that her journey takes place about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, a Finnish astronaut says on his website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw the Star Trek series on television.
Star wars have been seen, and that's where the idea was left to smoulder...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued their undefeated course in the Premier League as they knocked Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The sixth victory of the reigning champions was guaranteed by the goal sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to steer his fourth hit of the season to an empty goal at close range when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute at the back post of the Brighton goal.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he and Sterling sawed the Brighton defense to pieces in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 finals at the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City, who started the season, leads the Premier League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who have played one game less, are only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their own seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
In their meeting, which ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Societies selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term for 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
The council elected 40 actual members and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Societies reports on Sunday.
The youth meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
In fact, the youth association meeting held in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operational goals: We will keep the doors open to everyone, and we will organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we will support volunteer activities and people on their own growth paths, says the Finnish Youth Societies in a statement.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and surprised Ferrari: "Losing a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Räikkönen would not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would transfer to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, does not believe that Räikkönen would hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining races.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian Grand Prix.
Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes will start the race from pole position at 2 p.m.
The evening paper follows the race moment by moment.
Football's A-young SM-series championship battle became a total farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top tier of football for boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the round started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy has enough points against Vasa IFK in practice.
For the situation to turn in the final round, Ilves, second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the Lahti people.
However, the Lahti championship was practically confirmed even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had only arrived in Lahti with seven players.
Had there been one fewer Vasa, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
During the break, the Bayers led 7-0.
One of the reasons why Vaasans have lost players is that the team has partly played A-juvenile SM-series with the same players, i.e. P20-series and Men's Group Two C-series.
Vasa IFK has played in 2 against the fall of practically the entire season.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in the away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away game against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno - according to the rescue services, luck was involved
The passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof in Eno, Jutjuvaarantie, around 9 a.m. on Sunday.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were lightly injured, the rescue department reports.
Good luck, the statement said.
According to the rescue services, the road was wet from the rain.
Police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new means for intelligence: Equipment purchases and recruitments already made, no snooze from planning operations abroad
According to Supo Chief Antti Pelttari, the Intelligence Act has been prepared for by making equipment purchases and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the Intelligence Act, the sumo budget would be permanently increased by about ten million euros.
In the premises of the Security Police (supo) on Ratakatu in Helsinki, preparations are already being made for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Supo's head Antti Pelttari tells Lännen Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams in a video where she sings topless - campaign for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams shrugs again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings in front of her breasts, the AFP news agency reported.
The song is an Australian The Divinyls 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voted for The Divinyls' worldwide hit to remind women to regularly do self-checks," Williams wrote in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of skin color anywhere in the world.
Early detection is the a and o of everything - it saves many lives.
The Divinyls song is co-written by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of I Touch Myself, a project in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She passed away from breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the comments in the video, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams retired from the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There was a controversy at the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired on the main referee of the match and, among other things, claimed that men were allowed much more violent behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain path is not suitable for people with height fears
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves great scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.
It is literally located on a cliff ledge.
You can look at the forest below if you wish.
The lofty scenery in the heights causes restaurant visitors to gasp in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking among the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restroom is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good ground condition, the place is told.
The end of the Korpela alley today: This is how it all ends
All good things will come to an end in time.
Today it happens to the domestic country drama Korpela alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone hot: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television for the first time.
The peak figures themselves are no longer of any practical significance, as there is no continuation of the series by Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the final episode, Jaska and Mirkku's relationship takes another big leap forward, and I think Jaska's mother is the first to guess what's to come.
The relations between Anssi and Miisa are also warm, romantic in the light of recent events, but then Laiho appears once again.
Even the police are skeptical about the sneaky man.
Yet no one can foresee the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, gets to hear some incredible news.
The last will of Kauko comes forth, which brings the woman to the brink of tears.
In a week's time, Sunday evenings will continue with new episodes of Sorjonen.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people decide whether to stay at home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth infecting others, as the disease can be contagious even if your symptoms are small.
Sometimes the flu symptoms hit suddenly, sometimes they show up creeping up.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem minor, according to the Prevention release.
Is it worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person themselves has no symptoms.
The virus is already transmitted the day before symptoms begin and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease for longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be in school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough subsides and the fever is no more, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Returning to the gym too soon will slow down recovery.
In addition, be sure to wash your hands, blow on a handkerchief, and throw snot papers in the trash.
Sore to move, though?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the wearer aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't have to put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Sneezes are also limited with the mask.
How, then, could infection be avoided?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Hockey player and miss are often linked.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown has been awarded to Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school for his father's Russianness.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because of my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa, I didn't have any friends at all," Alina tells at the semifinalists' announcement of the Miss Finland pageant.
After secondary school, Alina decided to start fresh and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, Miss Beauty found new friends and the everyday life started to roll as desired.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with Pelicans.
Since his SM-liiga career, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distant relationship for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I could get into the winning trio and with that I would have a career, I don't want to believe it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live separately, trust works well for us and the good thing about the long-distance relationship is that the initial spark stays up all the time, Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth's resilience.
Yet, almost nothing is wanted to be given up.
Sustainable alternatives are being sought for continued growth, but even the theory of a reasonable economy runs into major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought a standard of living to ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, that could only be dreamed of in the past.
However, the long-term overshoot of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are making this market economy faltering threateningly.
Two men were stabbed on the night before Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born in 1968, was less severely injured.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose possible involvement in the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
Events are being investigated as attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Inter coach lamented the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt handicap against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match at 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through the right side and luckily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
With the guest saber, the Maarianhamians reached the difference to the Turun Palloseura in the place of the series-qualifier to two points.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg noted that the team did not, however, engage in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily the goal of the Turkuers brought us more strongly into the game.
John Allen, head coach of the home team Inter, said the game was under control, but the scoring was again painful.
One defense error took us a full pot of points, Allen lamented.
We were the best again!
Finland has the highest human value in the world
Finland is ranked number one in comparison to 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the people.
Finland is the best country in the world if you measure it by human capital.
Finland was ranked number one in a study that measured the health and education of citizens as well as learning.
The study measured the change in capital from 1990 to 2016.
The study was published in The Lancet.
According to the summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation exists in Africa.
The countries of the continent took the seven worst places in the comparison.
The rear is held by Niger.
This was first reported by STT.
Lehterä showed his underpower skills, the place of play is not yet certain
Jori Lehterä's strong underpowering came to prominence when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the season began.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehterä pitched Michael Rafflin twice to score.
In recent days, Lehterä has been on display due to suspected drug use.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in drug trafficking, with some suspected of drug use and some suspected of selling, for example.
Lehterä has denied having committed the crime.
The club and the player have discussed the issue, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, who follows the Flyers closely, estimated after the game that Lehterä is part of a group of six strikers, five of whom will get a place on the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehterä was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck for himself with underpower, pulled the defender on him and pitched Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open.
For the second time, the duo's collaboration brought the goal at the very end of the match.
The Flyers begin the NHL season on October 4 with a away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide if he can join the NHL group.
I thought training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL," Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
Vaakanainen, who had learned hockey in the River Boys, played 19.31 minutes against Philadelphia.
With the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rebuffed 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored a 1-0 goal for Detroit when the team took down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary, Ilves-raised defender Juuso Välimäki got a pass point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Koskinen, among others.
Florida's Aleksander Barkov played just over 20 minutes and pitched a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara pitched his team's consolation goal midway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With a losing goal, Joonas Korpisalo turned down 23/27 pucks.
Over 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to a survey concerning the decision on Finland's future time.
The question of whether Finland should permanently apply winter or summer time has already gathered well over 180,000 responses.
The survey opened in the Otakantaa.fi service can still be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
The respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
New photo shows change: World's strongest man loses tens of pounds
Crowned as the strongest man in the world in 2017, Eddie Hall is undergoing a striking transformation.
British Eddie Hall hunted for the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 kilocalories of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed 200 kilos at its maximum.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body was not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted for victory in the world's strongest man race by all means and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want her children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a photo on Instagram posing in a much slimmer condition than his active career.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that she now trains aerobically five times a week.
The program includes boxing, cycling, and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four workouts a week in the gym.
This year, Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, also known from the TV series Game of Thrones, weighed the strongest man in the world.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Supportingly caught on rock"
The inland water vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday evening in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alert for a waterborne traffic accident on Friday night after 9:30 p.m.
The 30-metre-long vessel M/S Tampere has hit a rock, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rock," said firemaster Matti Willman, who is on duty.
The ship carried 19 passengers and five crew members.
According to the rescue services, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere, said Chief on call Jari Nieminen to STT after 1 p.m. at night.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumunensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
Firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake were difficult due to the darkness and rather strong winds.
Rescue officials say the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship does not appear to be leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers begin to check what the situation is there at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant ship operating as an inland waterway vessel with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-Managers Claim Unpaid Rewards from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' evening match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat today reported on a summons application filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LLM Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius is charged a total of well over €80,000 in unpaid management fees, including interest on late payments.
According to the summons application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a lot of work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to Iltalehti explaining the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to the response, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially awkward situation to Helenius and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius is only obliged to pay commissions in percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly asserted that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only to receive the income arranged by them.
This is also normal and the only practice in professional athletes' management activities.
Salary work has never been agreed upon and that would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in a message he prepared.
There was never a written agreement.
According to the response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal poor on his own and broke off the cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius did not fight once when dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been assigned an "unique but substantial" bill for the manager's work.
The same claims have been filed this year.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent actions cowardly, the response states.
Helenius today faces boxing federation IBF heavyweight challenger Erkan Teperin, seventh in Stuttgart.
A man of heart and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-time radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli passed away at the age of 83 from terminal liver cancer.
The host's death notice was published in Sunday's Helsingin Sanomat.
The announcement says that Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the news of his acquaintance's fate.
He had already said goodbye on Facebook, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio sees Erkki Päll as a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers Päll was a well-liked person with quick wits and funny things.
I got to know Erki already as a little boy when I first visited Finnlevy when I was 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
That's when I met Erki.
He was then Finnlevy's publicist and in various positions, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I proceeded to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular reporter at all parties doing the stories about the artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see how great a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly on the skin of his interviewees.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
He became known to many as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erik interviewed me several times as well.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärki at Fazer, in addition to journalistic work.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loiri's albums.
Päll's biggest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in the ether of Yle.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the union's financial year, which ended in May, showed a profit of around 450,000 euros.
The union describes its economic situation as experiencing a "full turnaround", although the economy is, of course, burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises the quick response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management of operations has been instilled throughout our entire organization, Kulmala says in a press release.
We have also been very successful in our partner acquisition and, in addition, the return on the World Cups was maximum during the past competitive period.
However, in the future too, cost management must be precise, and at the same time we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital's backyard on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess injuries and need for care.
Patients are also being treated outside due to aftershocks.
One of those who moved around the hospital area was Baharuddin, a 52-year-old Palu, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school," Bahariuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the army hospital in Palu lay Dwi Haris, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel when the quake began with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to a wedding party in Paluu.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told the Associated Press, according to British media.
Small shops are looted
At the evacuation center in Palu, 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many residents of Palu have slept outside or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somehow standing, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the residents under them.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the inmates in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the inmates at Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set fire to the prison after guards told them not to go looking for relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been re-opened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land was an army C-130 transport plane, which brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
The pilots are forced to land at the airport without air traffic control assistance, as the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night before Sunday, a long rainy area from the west will spread over the whole country, the Finnish Meteorological Institute reports.
Rain mostly comes as water, but sleet or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The cold frosts of the previous night are not repeating, because under the cloud cover the temperatures remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively under control.
In the west, it is possible to visit the frost side for a moment, said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area recedes to the east during the morning.
To the south and west are poutic or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way up to the height of Oulu in stages of 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in the marine areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be variable weather for a typical autumn.
The autumn is now starting to really push on, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final not to be seen on TV
From IL-TV you can follow the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland contest.
Iltalehti's entertainment journalists are streaming live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final at Billnäs Ironworks.
The broadcast will begin at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnäs Ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the final starts, you will be able to watch the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast starts around 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, the finals have been attended by a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years.
They are represented on the jury by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Ziprus.
Other jury representatives include wellness entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, CEO of Jounin Kaukki Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd make it to college before he went to the pageant.
The Russian father Dimitri and the Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the recent Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, proudly followed their daughter's first moments with a crown on their head.
They entered the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finale.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result started to get exciting, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Ingrian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived her entire childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than a career as a Miss.
Alina was often told that when she's pretty enough to be a Miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
It was only later that Alina became enthusiastic about beauty contests.
It was her parents' wish that Alina would be admitted to university before she entered the Miss Finland competition.
That was the case, and in the end, Alina still wanted to do the bachelor's degree before the pageant.
We already asked last year why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish that bachelor.
Parents believe that Alina won the contest because she is a wholesome example to young people and adults alike.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be out there, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays ice hockey for a living in Japan, and was unable to come to Finland to encourage his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the young couple's relationship will last a year.
Yes, it is meant to be!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
There has been such a long hiatus in the visits due to the Missile Rushes.
I miss you already, even though I've been sent messages.
A young man was killed in a hit-and-run in Lahti - police arrested three people
Police say three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
Häme police did not comment on the course of events or the possible intentionality of the hit-and-run on Saturday, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also did not comment on whether the arrested persons and the man killed in the hit-and-run knew each other before.
More information on the case will not be available until early next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mom in Finland - an idea came to mind from the comic: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic nonsense once left my husband's statement, in which he suggested it as a person to the story I was developing, says Sari Piippo, a comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU translator doing economic and legal affairs in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what I would do when I was growing up, when even the smallest child was starting to be big.
Then in 2014 came a cartoon.
Piippo says that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintin and Asterix from an early age.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these Organic Nonsense manuscripts began to emerge then the situation changed.
At first, I made a few dozen manuscripts in a drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled draughtsman, but I couldn't get her involved until the summer of 2016 when I bribed Viivi with the help of a record.
His enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who tells him that the record was a great incentive for him.
A PCB is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
On paper I didn't even try to draw, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
Manuscripts pop into my mind all the time, but I don't usually finish at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I might make a screen at a time and enjoy playing with colors.
It's always the hardest to start drawing, because drawing isn't my strong suit.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among others, for the contemporary comics in the newspapers.
The characters of the organic rump are a carrot-stemmed mother with a salad-haired bush.
The other characters are Male, Piss and Twins.
In a world of organic nonsense, a person is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer a forced bun even though the Organic Nonsense is pushing the issue sometimes.
Piippo says that she is reading her series with her husband and children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you've drawn and say that's what I've done today.
And there are enough challenges for a housewife!

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - didn't leave a cracked tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to transport a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely from an earthquake-stricken island.
The young man was on duty at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when an earthquake struck on Friday.
As the others fled the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to direct Batik Air's passenger plane from the runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives," the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower shook and cracked.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he passed away 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an FAA spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify as the flight reached the air, and was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitude.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
Indonesia's aviation administration has honored Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn pondered Yle Europe's ending in a trade war: "We need to watch the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
In Yle's first morning, Director General Olli Rehn said that although the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on trade flows in Europe, it weakens confidence, which in turn is reflected in companies' investment decisions.
This also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn thinks that Europe is so far very talented.
It has been able to build an interim peace with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be grinding at the feet of a trade war.
You have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world as a whole.
The market reacted violently yesterday to the clearly deficit budget presented by the Italian government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credit and more than ten per cent is unsystematic credit.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak position and the country appears to again exceed its commitments vis-à-vis its European partners.
It may not be worth painting yet more crises, Rehn replied when asked if Italy is taking Europe into a new economic crisis.
Another issue facing Europe is Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would come to terms.
A contentious breakup would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as the Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will step down in just over a year.
The debate over his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen has flashed in speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said, adding that he will not comment further on the matter.
HS's super popular Black Box performances will resume next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organized by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again this week.
Other performances will be shown at the National Theatre on October 2, 8, and 11.
October 23 The Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale to the National Theatre.
The Tampere performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not previously been published in any HS medium.
Again, there is something that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the Helsinki night, an impressive reportage from the other side of the world and a telling story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
More than 15,000 people have visited the stands already.
The Black Box was awarded at the Bonnier Awards as the journalistic act of the year.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The Black Box of the spring season 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance will also visit Tampere and Turku.
The content of the performance at that time is different from that of this autumn evenings.
Missing mushroom beetle found thanks to "prejudiced experiment"
Finnish police's drone expertise is among the best in the world: "We are being asked for trainings"
According to the headmaster of the Police University College, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and reconnaissance missions.
On Tuesday, Oulu police were able to find a missing mushroom preventer in Raahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the headmaster of the Police University College, tweeted about the incident, mentioning, among other things, that "through unbiased experimentation and effective training, we are also at the top of the world here."
The drone is quite a new thing and even newer in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has become clear, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is tremendous interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the drone action of the Finnish police.
We are being asked for training.
Increasingly generalized
Himberg points out that it is very important to find someone who has disappeared in the winter conditions in Finland as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they are to be further trained.
Already, drones are widely used in police missions, and their use will become more common and increasing in the future.
That is what I would dare to say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police can use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of reconnaissance missions.
For example, you already have to check an area a little further away, where you may be afraid that there will be violence.
Drones can then be used for advance inquiry.
Karelian Rugby entered the 1st division
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of Division 2 in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and porched the Southern guests 26-12.
At the same time, the championship of the 2nd division marked the historic rise of Karelian Rugby to the 1st division.
The club has previously played in first place, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-series and the multi-block 1-division.
The club is going to take the series spot, but that means a lot of work for next winter.
The current roster of less than twenty players must be increased to 25.
The 1st Division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer game distances, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
The head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked super-promise Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round at number three in the summer draft.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has presented strong grips in September's training matches.
Kotkaniemi immediately managed to score in his first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finns for taking big steps after arriving at the camp.
The NHL regular season begins on the night of Thursday next week, Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk this week about leadership in Finland.
Nokia Chairman of the Board Risto Siilasmaa told in an interview with HS about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila vehemently denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have also talked about the managers' inability to act as a team; fear and lack of talk, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's risk-taking and agility in the upturn disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki, which drew the Finnish business crème to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business stars also took to the stage.
The talk of good leadership was enough.
Management legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a store chain known for its wide range of organic products, said that the manager must be able to communicate the company's purpose to the entire staff.
And that purpose cannot simply be to make profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book on introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are researched to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and purposefully.
They are often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, reminded that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the stage of a company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature stage needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of information overload.
It takes a lot to be a good leader.
That's why leadership so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes in a friendly manner.
However, they hardly wonder if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge by an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived gorgeous on the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the miss finals in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland showy dress also had a lace drapery.
A little bit of jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak says.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for auditions.
Among other things, he has done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, according to him, work needs to be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for model work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors wins €30,000 live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
Winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, Lindfors works with choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish artist Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group active in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo searched for in major operation: 'We can't tell where'
An extensive search by the Danish police has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Öresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlann were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were searching for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
The car we've been looking for has been found.
We can't yet tell where the car was found," Henrik Storm of the Copenhagen Police Department told Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the black Volvo sought has no direct connection to the threat, police said.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Denmark's Ekstra Bladet reported on a police briefing on Saturday.
Investigator Jørgen Bergen Skov was silent about the course of the operation.
He didn't want to tell me under what crime heading the case is being investigated.
However, Skov said that it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched during the operation.
Police will not say if they have been caught.
According to the newspaper, restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the general public no longer has any cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people vote on the issue in a contentious election
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek governments, the name would become the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's bid to join NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the electorate supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
Voting began slowly, at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, called for support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough tension in whether the turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but winning the yes votes would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to amend the Constitution.
The Greek parliament also has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
Handsome win!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius faced Erkan Teper late Saturday night in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took on his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, near Stuttgart.
The main match of the evening was the IBF heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to fight in tasks that are tougher than those seen on Saturday, and that are of considerable economic importance.
Helenius finished the match in the eighth round, when he knocked Teper out with his hard left hand.
Teper was no longer able to get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent already in the third period, when the German nose began to bleed.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight as early as December 2015.
At that time, Teper pleaded for injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had been fried twice in a doping test.
Helenius has claimed 28 games in his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who has been a clear favourite in the match, has won 19 professional games and lost three times.
Hamilton with team order to win - difference to Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title was once again approaching its confirmation, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian GP and stretched his World Championship lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel as early as 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left pole position in the race, finished second.
Bottas, who won his career opening in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel finished third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth.
The two assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Juukalainen man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police said the men also intercepted the victim's phone.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with hay water and a 39-year-old man from Ilomantsi, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim suffered contusions that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, is leaving his position as chairman of the company's board of directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweets that he would have secured funding to pull Tesla out of the stock exchange.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a €20 million fine if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting time to reach an agreement on NAFTA with the U.S.
Time threatens to run out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada over a free trade agreement on NAFTA.
The U.S. has set a deadline for Sunday, and negotiators from the two countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's Chief Negotiator, Secretary of State Chrystia Freeland, postponed her speech at the UN General Assembly in order to fully focus on trade talks.
At the insistence of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada, and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to put the deal into effect before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans are in place to sign the deal at the end of November - whether Canada was involved or not.
Because of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the United States Congress to evaluate it.
Neighbor thought candles were lit as a fire in Kaakkuri - fire brigade was alerted to the scene
Candles burned in an apartment building in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue services units were alerted to the scene due to a possible apartment building fire.
It was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna in the apartment building had looked like a fire to the house opposite, which was why the matter had been reported to the emergency services.
There was no fire at the target.
Police arrested 11 people after Honka-HJK match - brawling on the ground and at the subway station
Eleven people were apprehended by the police after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league played in Espoo on Saturday, West Uusimaa Police Department crime commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The grounds for the arrest were protection against crime and disorder.
The captured were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The arrests were previously reported by Evening News.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed into the field from the stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to push-ups and fistfights between supporters of the teams.
Among other things, it took cavalry officers to put an end to the situation.
In addition to the field, the brawl took place in the area of a nearby metro station, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the brawl on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
Table stone rattled his butterfly swimming time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals on the closing day of the World Cup 3/7 competition in the Netherlands.
The race is held in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Tablestone set a Finnish record in the 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was second in the preliminary rounds with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Tablestone swam in Helsinki during the SE time of 22,77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was 24th in the butterfly swim with a time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the preliminary rounds of the 50 m breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the finals.
At the start of the two-hundred-meter mixed heat, Laukkanen was 15th in 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delicacy: the ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects with its visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on the Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre has last seen an ancient tragedy, Sophocles' Philoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour starting from the National Theatre the only complete trilogy of plays in antiquity, the Oresteia of Aeschylus.
In the Lavat open! projects, which began in 2015, the Theatre Academy's acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha's atoning from Oresteia sums up the story of the end of the blood feud of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law with merit to an hour and twenty minutes, especially by condensing the choir sections.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuur's fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and showcasing the sides of the theatre space emphasize simplified and bright stage thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between the performers who break away from the choir, playing title roles, and the choir.
The performance uses both double and triple interpretations of the title roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and his spoils of war, Kassandra, are also shown on the stage, in contrast to what was customary in the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created before the viewer's eyes, constantly aware of its ritual-like roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of master's-level acting students as a close group, downright one organism.
Actors, especially in the choir sections, who bend to very expressive, sculptural group formations, are able to get their rights bare, only with a white curtain adorned, on the stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The novelty is beginning to show in Europe, thanks in particular to the cooperation agreement between Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a 1,000-car batch of the new model for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai will continue on the road paved by the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project of its kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles by, for example, monitoring the development of the refuelling network," In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, said at the announcement of the agreement.
Fist fluttered several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men in and out of a restaurant in central Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one of the men inside the restaurant, resulting in him being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.
Police caught the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to act aggressively and kicked another policeman in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is being investigated as three counts of assault and violent opposition to an official.
There was also another assault incident in the centre of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old Kajaani man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him to the ground and the man who hit him earlier still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the assailants away from the victim and police were called.
However, the perpetrators had already left before the police arrived.
The police will ask witnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani Police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at tietki.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long-line radio host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of terminal liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is it.
Even the doctor has said it, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of trade aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When these rings of years surprise you, it's usually the big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähäraa, a working environment expert for the Finnish Service Industries Union (PAM).
He says that crime statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers, of course, claim otherwise.
Only cases that are clearly considered serious go to the police and many real violence situations go unreported.
"Of course, companies have a duty to record their near miss situations under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics will remain for internal use and their data will not be collected anywhere," he said.
Mental disabilities don't end up in statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, mental trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between a situation of violence and a threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threat has to be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid of their workplace, even if the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
As the opening hours of the stores were released, there was also a considerable amount of flabbergasting in the media about its impact on sellers' safety.
"At that time, quite a few employers organised guard services at least for night-time hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When, due to guarding, the disturbances remained well under control, the impression was created that guarding would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive guard services.
A minor assault is a plaintiff's crime, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make a request for investigation of a criminal who usually lives near a store.
But under the same law, enacted in 2011, mild assault becomes a matter for the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle of the store is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court put a few abusers in jail, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, the manners would be cleaned up.
A society in which a grocery store must be open almost night and day in small towns must guarantee the safety of store workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for miss before the live broadcast begins - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The coronation of Miss will not be seen on TV as usual this year, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Iiro Harjula, the host of Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
The backstage and red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives that the broadcast was going on.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a standing ovation.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this guy, Sohlberg cheered his colleagues as the audience cheered.
The front row games are followed by many Miss Finland of previous years.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat next to each other and Sohlberg made a small joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married then!
Sohlberg squinted, looking towards the Saros.
Most likely, Sohlberg was referring to Sieppi, who had just resigned, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke about his resignation for the first time in the Ilta-Sanomat weekend newspaper.
Missikaunotar told that she does not want to open the reasons for the divorce in more detail in public, as that is a matter between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said that he is not in a hurry to have a new relationship, but that he is going to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things and especially I start to live my own life alone," Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up even later when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for the screw-up.
The Ostrobothnian man tortured his tied common-law partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his common-law spouse.
Among the tools used to commit the crime were a belt, cable, and cable ties.
The court sentenced those items to state forfeiture.
Rank's charge involved a suspect in a felony rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
The offender was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two counts of damage.
The crimes took place between March 26 and May 24.
At the end of the last acts, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its judgment and ordered the 34-year-old to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed as unproven by the court.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge issued a public record of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused slashed his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed a concentrated sauce, and poured water and coffee over him.
In its sentencing, the court ordered the state to forfeit its criminal equipment: a belt and cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a vest.
The Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It can be read in the verdict that a large part of the most heinous acts took place at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The 34-year-old must pay a total of 5,800 euros in compensation for pain, aching, suffering and temporary harm.
He hardly has the money in question, for the condemned man already has debts in debt collection.
Imprisonment is not a man's first.
The evening paper does not give the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
At the time of this writing, the recent District Court judgment is not final.
Europe lead by four points to Ryder Cup settlement
On Saturday, European golf professionals jailed their lead in a traditional hole-playing match against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup around Paris with 10-6 points, while there are still twelve doubles to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the afternoon's four-ball game the wins were tied at 2-2.
Europe's leading stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four games they played as a couple during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had achieved such a feat.
On Sunday, the duo will seek more history.
No European player has ever won five points in one Ryder Cup, and even Americans have only been able to do so by three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns violent harassment of its supporters at Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
Football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters at the FC Honka match in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We regret the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the pitch and some appeared to be trying to pick a fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The policemen were not able to calm the situation, but policemen and also mounted police were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team's players and officials were shocked by what had happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We strongly disassociate ourselves from any activity that endangers the safety of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers to identify factors that threaten safety and to eliminate side effects.
Supporter culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support in every way positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stands.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies a drone car - thus avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a growing group around the world that vows to invent a flying car - or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in mass production of his equipment.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he flew his device at an altitude of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will elicit positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action to begin tomorrow will be visible in children's day care and social and health services
In the public and welfare sectors, the overtime and shift change bans that will start tomorrow will be visible especially in social and health services and children's day care, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of the JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in a way that there will not be enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their child.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services are playing and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from working overtime and changing shifts due to contract negotiations.
Through flexibility, employers have made it possible for staff not to be hired, but for workers to work overtime or change shifts.
This is not yet an industrial action.
In terms of occupational safety and health, it is the norm to take care of and only do regular working hours for each employee.
The JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of small businesses from dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, Labour Market Director for Local Government Employers, will not undertake a pre-emptive assessment of the effects of the overtime and shift change bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services can deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so impossibly large, the social and health service and the technical sector, that it is hard to say.
The impacts can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week there were already experiences of similar activities by the local and basic nursing union Super and the social and health care trade union Tehy, which lasted three days.
Their effects were quite minor.
The JHL overtime and shift change ban applies to employees of municipalities, the church, the state and the private social and health care sector, among others.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
The industrial action concerns nearly 100,000 JHL members at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Act on Layoffs continues.
The government should now admit that this is running to the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must meet.
What is special about this is that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the motion has not yet been given, Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - in the fitness circles of the performance, the gestures of the ray and the sea horse are studied
In the Other Spaces collective, the Great Coral Reef premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
This time, however, a clearer-cut presentation is also being built, which refreshes and crystallises the observations made in the exercises of the beginning.
There is also plenty of fairytale magic in theatre play for child participants.
The child's point of view has already been included in the preparation of the work.
Still, the Great Coral Reef is not a children's show, but a show that adults and children do together.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and play together also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
Indeed, the Great Coral Reef is somewhat like a fairytale ballet, a fitness circle and a nature-themed information shot, but finally it is attuned to other kinds of non-human conditions around visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the trajectories of corals, as well as of living organisms and fish on the coral reef.
Six different fitness circles teach, among other things, the gestures of the ray and the sea horse.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour will be performed, with music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes to help explore the life of the coral reef.
In the Great Coral Reef, there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef as well as corals that are being looked at.
In addition, there are organisms that look at corals.
Eyes and observations in many directions make the performance dense and teeming with life.
Whether it is the landscape of an organism, an organism that looks at a landscape, and another organism or landscape that looks at an organism - and all of this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult at all.
With their practices in other spaces, the group strives for a limit of thought and action that is challenging to reach when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
Disasters beyond one's understanding should not be allowed to harden, though it might be difficult to grasp the significance of practicing one's own compassion any longer in the face of visions of destruction.
Other spaces have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousnesses, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears the way.
Kids grow up too fast - I'm happy there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking at a younger and younger age.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, and not mess up their lives for substance abuse and sex, because others say they do too.
I was overwhelmed when a friend told me that she had to pick up her fifth grade sister over the weekend from her "boyfriend".
When he came for his drunken sister, she told him about her sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I wish that today's kids could have a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure their friends create.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram wearing makeup and revealing their clothes.
Snapchat is used in the evenings to take and send revealing photos.
It is increasingly difficult for girls to guess what age they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am happy that there were no smart phones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and didn't have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities told the state leadership that the case Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Finnish Security Intelligence Service and the Defence Forces went to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been told that the Airiston Helmi investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle reported.
The information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by the chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered a financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here," Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle, no evidence of a connection to national security has so far been found in the seized material, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way to know what may be revealed there, says one of Yle's interviewees.
Extensive house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely a matter of financial crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled a story that goes through claims both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saved Liverpool's losing series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a happier team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran for a 1-0 away win.
The combination of Pep Guardiola then sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And certainly Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started out stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in control of his own end of the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a Wednesday's great league cup away win over Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a stunning individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first bowled in a small space with a triangle game with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard swoop forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but then bombarded the back corner of the perfect left foot draft.
Pool's brass guard Alisson was a bit slow in his fight and could only get his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the defeat position was lightly unfair, because almost immediately afterwards Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's steering off the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea veteran Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the post into a corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, on his turn, reset Hazard's drive-through.
The best spot for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
However, the brass star's butt turned towards national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
Even that didn't last in the 89th minute as changeling Daniel Sturridge was able to freely shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the top corner in honor of it.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it remains at the top of the league - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also tightly involved in the championship fight with two points behind the top.
In the clock-shifting debate, the potholes are deep
I remember a few decades ago, a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's response was the only one left in mind: the Nen ending.
Some have a n-n ending in their last name and some do not.
After all, divisions can arise anywhere, and here was one offering.
Finland has made it possible for the EU to phase out the annual clock change.
Very many people agree that changing the clocks twice a year has been a fool's errand and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, at least in Finland, this achievement seems to be the easiest stage of the solution, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time of day you will end up with: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows people to express their opinions on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
The debate is heated at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people's well-being and those who defend summer time with the influence of evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and, consequently, well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even studies show that morning light sets the rhythm of a person's day and gives them vitality.
On the other hand, if you don't particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light increases people's movement outdoors and gives better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its hour.
I'd rather have both, but sadly for our location in the northern part of the globe, we can't do anything.
The winters are too dark and the summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical of a discussion on a topic is that one's own view is promoted and the other's view is strongly opposed.
There is little listening to the arguments of the opposing side, because the most important thing is how the thing itself feels.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat futile to try to turn the other person's head.
It's a waste of powder.
The subject matter is terribly easy to debate, because the subject matter does not require much effort and a mutu-feel is sufficient justification.
Similar types of issues are usually the most vehemently and equally fruitless in the debate.
It will be a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think it will adapt as well.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels down.
Josba fought a close away away victory
Josba's first away game at Floorball's Divar produced a full three points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki on his way home with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third period, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plot a 6-5 winning goal.
Both teams played crucial minutes in the draw.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepower anyway when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
Next up will be O2-Jyväskylä with guests in two weeks.
Eno Church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a partly sad atmosphere.
The burning of the church a week ago was a shock.
Even Eno's church was guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a day of celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other connections in the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church today at 10 a.m.
After that, we move to the parish house by the Karelian's banquet table.
There are all sorts of things going on in and out of the program throughout the day.
For example, the church building can be visited with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has been a parish master for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the church also marks the end of an era.
The parish house, built in 1982, is already in use and will keep its doors open today for the last time.
Now we are in evasive spaces at the former municipal hall, says chaplain Markku Koistinen.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in its healthy place for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as head of Tesla board of directors - Fraud charges settled at $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, have settled their lawsuit with the SEC, the U.S. securities regulator.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
However, Musk is allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk is forced to step down as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company will have to hire an external chairman of the board.
Musk is also subject to stricter controls.
Under the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will both pay $20 million (about €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruption and harm to Tesla's shareholders," said Steven Peikin, director of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company out of the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced it was suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from running any more listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went down sharply.
More than 800 killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency.
The death toll is expected to continue to rise, as damage is still to be determined.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on Sulawesi Island.
Immediately after the quake, a warning was issued about the tsunami, but it was quickly canceled.
Officials say almost all known dead are from Palusta, at least for now.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the center of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to have died.
Requests for help from Ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the soldiers to continue the rescue work day and night.
One of the focal points of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are still believed to be in the ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said that one person was found alive in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular hotel for business travelers.
We also heard calls for help from people, he said.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would be urgently needed for the quake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one of the authors appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to flaws in the encryption of the app.
The troublemakers had access to the ministers' telephone numbers, among other things.
It was an application used at a party convention of the British Conservative Party in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, former Secretary of State, were harassed.
Several members of parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the app's lack of encryption, the public had access to the politicians' profiles in the mobile app of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public had access to the profiles by using the politician's e-mail address, which was easily accessible online.
The person logging into the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to briefly change Boris Johnson's profile photo to a porn picture and title offensive.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to that of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
The user can then view the profile person's contact information and, for example, send messages in their name.
The meeting app made every reporter, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A spokesperson for the Conservative Party apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) is supporting the data leak.
The app was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The Labour Party, which is in opposition, criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland quiz features a large crowd of clapping Poles in the audience every week
Observant viewers drew attention to the studio audience's reactions to The Wall Suomi quiz show.
The fast-spreading US format The Wall landed in Finland version 4 last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are being made.
The possibilities for filming in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the format's large 12-metre-high game wall required space from the farm.
During the start-up period, the program's studio audience was highlighted on social media, which was guessed to be Polish.
There was a discussion on Twitter about whether Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the head of the Finnish programmes at Four, explains the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience has close friends of the players, other Finns, expatriates living in Poland and just Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who attend the filming of various programmes, Sormunen explains.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult, even if one does not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to tell apart.
For foreign-language speakers, however, there are interpreters present in the studio who will handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as simultaneous interpretation to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap is thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was dealt with recently in domestic production.
A few years ago, David Hasselhoff was part of the filming of Talent Finland with us in Finland.
He had simultaneous interpretation in his ear all the time and knew everything that was spoken in Finnish on the set, Sormunen sums up.
Typhoon hits main islands in southern Japan, warns of landslides and floods
Authorities are also warning of possible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon in Tram, but authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and there are no reports of casualties so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are at a standstill in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around half a day Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the path of the storm, but there will also be strong winds and rain.
Train services have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to weather scientists, Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces grew darker
The early days of the Aces have been bad.
The sky became almost pitch black when the team lost to Vaasan Sport on Saturday by 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, and a total of two points from six rounds.
No Aces defender or two lower-chain players have scored yet.
The pressure is also increasing all the time.
Against Sport, the audience was already out of the hall by the time there was almost half of the game left.
Six games have just been played and there is of course no reason to give up.
Of course, we have to be worried, because that's how weak we played.
Especially the second-round performance was embarrassingly bad, Jarno Kärki, who made 1+2 for Ässi, told.
It was a win for the sport, of course.
The team had a game from Friday below, so you would have thought it would show up in the making.
Maybe it did, but Aces didn't know how to take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the day of bread continued to increase
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders at the audience of the big hall.
Somehow you thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Finnish Championships in Tractor Cycling were held simultaneously with the Bread Day, so perhaps it would be expected that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, this was not the case; the aisles were already heavily clogged before 10 a.m., the sellers reported that the products had run out, more news porridge was sold for nearly 500 servings than before, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars was on the rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
Five hours in the morning and afternoon were particularly suitable for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record-breaking number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Vendors also curve to Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year nearly a hundred presenters, vendors of handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at the bread keeper.
The mother of the day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the public vote.
11 different shapes of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the martto pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here's how you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere in the interior, and read the book without tiring your eyes.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux Sales and Marketing Director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do Your Eyes a Service
The importance of lighting increases the more years there are behind.
Sufficient light can be used to help with the problems that many face with age, as visual acuity decreases and glare suffers more and more.
As we get older, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
Therefore, it is worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you.
A beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
At this moment, the decorator can afford to choose.
The popularity has a Japanese style that combines gestures, Scandinavianness and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colors has also become a boom.
Authenticity fascinates me in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more is invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing oneself.
Instead of mass production, they want a custom-made, even bold light fixture with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
Not necessarily the latest trend light, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewellery-like and elegant classics stand their ground year after year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and goodbye!
Kookoo showed the door to a Canadian striker after three games
Kookoon and attacker Brendan O'Donnell's roads diverge.
A Canadian striker played a total of three League games in orange black without any power points, Kookoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old striker played for Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and the KHL farm in the VHL at KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is yet to be announced.
Player wants to lead by example in recycling - goods leave for the world in recycling boxes, plastic switched to paper
The game specialist now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the brick-and-mortar shop's customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged, for example, in packages from importers.
All packages coming to us will be reused.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, Ville Puurula from Oulun Pelimies.
As a padding material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also going to move to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
There will also be financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for Pelimies operations, as in addition to new products, the store's key product range includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying every fashion conscious: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in a costume.
They provide a good basis for garderob with their versatility, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics even at low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
A black knitwear made of natural material with polo collars cannot be mistaken.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirt and jeans, and you can create both a discreet outfit and a sleek style around it.
The turtleneck is suitable for both the youthful modern dresser and the classically sophisticated stylist.
This is how you create style.
The trend look of autumn is born of golden-brown and wide-legged corduroy trousers, black polo knitwear and gray ankle boots.
The classic polo knit together with other classics, the blue-green Scots plaid skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Bring an edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casual trendy clothing: a denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
The sabotage activities of Russian intelligence services have a long tradition
There is no reason to believe that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and reconnaissance group.
The agents of the KGB in the West prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), an archivist who defected from the KGB to the West.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB procured uniforms and accessories for DRG teams for covert operations of the Bundeswehr, railways, gamekeepers and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot gear, set up checkpoints on roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from its mother country.
Cold War agents hid supplies with mines, explosives, detonators, and communications equipment in the terrain for sabotage groups.
As recently as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, whose booby trap exploded when authorities sprayed it with a water cannon.
Police reached four drunk drivers in the province last night
Police caught four drunk drivers in various parts of North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mil.
He drove at half past four in the early part of Kajaanintie with two passengers on board.
On Kuorevaarantie in Polvijärvi, the car went into a ditch at 4 a.m., and a 19-year-old local man in the car alone blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him in the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old man from an out-of-town town who drove a passenger car blew 1.33 per mille into the breathalyzer.
The police suspect the male drivers in question of aggravated drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi also of endangering traffic safety.

He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are asking for reports of a stabbing at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on a surveillance camera.
The dark-haired suspects, dressed in dark pants and a brown or beige coat, left immediately after the stabbing in a dark station wagon towards Ratapihankatu bus station.
One suspect took a bicycle off Humalistonkatu in the direction of downtown.
Pedestrian killed after being hit by a bus in Pori

The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in their ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's trial period ended
Hämeenlinna HPK sports director Mika Toivola says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in starting, underpowering and defending role in field four.
Filip Riska, who played on trial in the early autumn, will continue in Hämeenlinna HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Filip has been an important piece for us in starting, underpowering and the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, says Mika Toivola, Director of Sports at HPK.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska rises when playing the ice hockey league's decision games.
Riska, a centre-back from Pietarsaari, has previously played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.
Boxer Oskari Lehtinen, on the other hand, was left without a contract after the trial period.
A true story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
Beck Weathers, an American, wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
Tonight's film is based on them.
Everest will now premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 direction is about the struggle for survival, which has been treated to a great deal of grain.
There have been films - and documentaries - about the tragedy before.
Real events are also going through in this case.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who served as Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life may have been saved by an eye surgery performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, which meant that the conquest of the summit had to be skipped.
Rob Hall continued on his way and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for the man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
Miraculously, however, he still got on his feet and found the others.
Weathers was thought to be still dying and once again was left to his own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility that he was given help.
In the film, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall as Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer as Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old church of Eno has been celebrated today
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was consecrated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration for the whole family was prepared for Sunday.
The festivities began at 10 a.m. at Eno Church Hill with a family fair, after which Karelian's banquets have been served at Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the Family Mass.
Eno's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It will be a great joy for a long time to come and give strength to the work, says Rautavuori (pictured).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Excitement Danger, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after the church in Kiihtelysvaara was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the danger of aggravation, a devotional was held in the morning to quiet down and remember the church that was destroyed in the fire.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed his might in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled over from southwest to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Agency has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show a lot of flooding all over Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared instead of a street in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese, strong winds caused strong sea travel.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The embassy urges you to follow the weather reports and instructions from the local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, only once or twice a year occurs in the world, typically between September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm now blowing left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been caused by refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to proper shelter.
The areas around Athens destroyed by wildfires also remain under the storm in the summer.
There was also a medical crisis in Greece last November.
There is no need to go to the sea now, flights still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently vacationing on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Excursions to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk on top of the storm.
Guides to this kind of guidance have distributed to more than 3,500 Finns holidaying through Aurinkomatkat in Greece over the weekend.
Instructions will be needed, as even the hurricane Zorbas is predicted to batter the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise up to 45 metres per second in gusts.
Heavy rains add to the wretchedness of the weather.
All those who have travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland have reported their phone numbers, according to the tour operators, have been warned of strong winds by text message.
Still sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert in communications for aurinkomatkat, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by early evening on Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we monitor the situation all the time.
Safety comes first.
Tui's media officer Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the site.
At least it was still peaceful in Crete, he said on Saturday in the early evening.
Tui currently has over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had shone on Rhodes and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, Ikonen says.
It is estimated that Zorbas will be the next nuisance for Turkey, albeit slightly mitigated.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and checked the number of Finns who flew to Antalya on Tui, for example," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvine and Janni Huss have completely identical evening gowns in the Missifinals - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirly Garfield.
The two of them also noticed their similar outfits and reacted with laughter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat he was in a hurry to get ready, and he had to get ready on the plane.
Hussi acts as a backstage and red carpet host in the miss finals, and he talks to the front-row stars who arrive.
Huss has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, let's see what happens.
It is essential that the new apartment has its own study room, Hussi pondered.
Before moving, Hussi was vacationing alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was only in the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When the stress broke, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvinen's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnered curious glances from seniors
The host and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet that she had had enough to do with radio shows and Love Island Finland shoots.
There has been enough haste to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finals directly from Finnair flight.
I put on makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
The evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Karvinen says that he pulled out his makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people looking in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least to others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says that he enjoyed his job as host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience so far as being also arresting.
Karvinen says that he went to say hi to the singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some ways.
They are people's genuine feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles on the show.
How Do I Wear Over Knee Boots?
Three perfect example outfits
Classic clothes are pieces of clothing that work from season to season in any outfit.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can fit in.
A few years ago, the over-knee boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have not gone anywhere.
As the name suggests, boots that reach over the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
Appearing boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - boldly.
After all, over-knee boots are really suitable for any outfit.
Whether it's jeans, lace, tulle or tricot, the simple leather or imitation leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look great in festive look as well as everyday outfits.
Black over-knee boots are well suited for even the most delicate outfits.
Appropriately, they balance the femininity of the pink, flowery pliser skirt and the tender, plush knitwear.
A fresh but autumny stylish everyday outfit for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is created by a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-knee boots, spectacular earrings and a rivet purse.
Although the over-knee boots have a certain sophistication, they are also perfect for casual everyday wear together with a t-shirt, long shorts and trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so stylish!
Two robotic cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi's robotic cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as traffic in the area is scheduled to start next spring with a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robotic cars fare on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real-world environment," says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars will completely automatically travel among other traffic without any special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger on board.
The vehicles sense their surroundings all the time with several different sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether the detected obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, a snowflake, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for developing robotic traffic.
The robot cars run three days a week throughout the autumn: on Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30, on Wednesdays from 10 to 15 and on Thursdays from 10 to 15.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
The stops of robotic cars are identified by stop markings.
The most secure way to get on board is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
The bassist of the band Mokoma fell off stage in the middle of the show and was injured.
On their Facebook page, the band Mokoma announces a surprising situation at a Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
The Mokoma band's gig at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation occurred when the band was running the last song of the night.
Hämäläinen's wrist was broken.
The band announces this on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped yesterday at Pakkahuone from the stage in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour's gigs are handled by a backup crew, it says on the website.
Fans of Mokoma respond with concern to a photo update in which bassist-Santtu is lying on a bed with a plaster in hand.
This news has been awaited, it was quite a concern how bad it was.
The relief is great, fortunately the bones heal over time.
Good luck and a speedy recovery for Santu and a good tour continuation for the rest of the band plus a replacement!
And thanks for yesterday, it was a great gig, but will you promise to leave out such a strong drama from the end of the shows? writes one fan.
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's batch contact persons reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state land.
In addition, the permits for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in chicken birding were checked.
According to police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
Twelve daily fines were imposed on the hunter for unauthorized fishing.
Police also inflated 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected of drink-driving.
In addition, the patrols handled five traffic violations in fine proceedings, police times.
To sum up, hunters follow hunting permission very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone's checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting supervision in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
This year, Finland has decided to admit 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police are involved.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, people with disabilities and the sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the group of those coming to Finland than are in the quota, because in practice some people are not arriving for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and NGOs operating on the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Talked about increasing the quota
Finland has been accepting quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since been reached by the government to increase it.
The Coalition Party has supported an increase in the quota, but the project has most recently fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently proposed to gradually increase the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit will be the first during this government term that the Minister of the Interior will make on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risikko (co.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going off the rails - you don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, as a rule, prohibits the keeping of all animals that are not specifically permitted by ministerial decrees as production animals, pets or otherwise related to business activities.
Thus, everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals specifically mentioned in the decree.
If the bill ends up being a law, it probably means that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the safety or good manners of society.
In principle, a ban on all activities not specifically authorised by law or regulation is now being enacted.
The change causes that nothing new can be tried in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until a law or decree approving it has been issued.
The government's role in the drafting of the law in general has been weak.
If you start on the path that in principle everything is forbidden in Finland, which is not separately allowed, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But a law project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'anything is prohibited, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation'.
Hopefully, there will be some reasonable minister who will interrupt the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell tips: The four trendiest skirts of autumn
This autumn's trendy clothing comes in snake patterns.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Combine a snake-patterned skirt with more restrained tops, such as a polo or plain t-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
This autumn, a lot of silk can be seen and the silk skirt in particular is one of the trendiest pieces of clothing in the season.
Combine a gorgeous silk skirt with a sophisticated feminine top or casually paired with a sweater.
You can play with the silk skirt even more boldly and throw on e.g. sneakers or cowboy boots in the autumn trend shoes.
No matter if it's gray, brown, or multi-tone, all checkered skirts are now part of every woman's must-have.
Boldly combine different colors with each other and play with the plaid patterns also with the different patterns on the top.
For example, the combination of a grid pattern and a ball pattern is beautiful.
Asymmetrical hems are a breeze from the lightness of summer, which can be taken with you into autumn.
The asymmetrical hem is at the same time feminine and playful and fits nicely into both everyday life and celebration.
Baby Alexia, 3 months, sulks sweetly in Jere's arms
In the Karalaht family photo, the sweet three-month-old baby Alexia comes to the centre of attention.
Nanna Karalahti tells about the Aito day care centre established in Kerava.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, received a family addition in early July.
The couple's firstborn son Jax turned 2 years old in May, while little Alexia is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti for trainees in Marbella, Spain, which included the entire Karalahti family.
Nanna posted on Instagram a picture of the atmosphere of Spain posing for the whole Karalahti family.
The children Jax and Alexia are in their parents' arms.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly sulky baby Alexia, who is resting in the arms of Father Jere.
Grateful for this.
Grateful for goodness, forgiveness, people's generosity and joy, writes Nanna Karalahti alongside the family portrait.
Nanna Karalahti and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti, who came out of the Fitness Diaries program, recently went into kindergarten business and opened an Aito daycare centre in Kerava.
In addition to Karalahts, the company includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisananti, who is responsible for the education side.
Johanna Tervo was hired as the head of the day care centre.
Turkey urges mobile phones to be charged in case of storm
The Zorba storm, which blew in Greece on Saturday, is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists on Saturday specifically warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country of the storm in Greece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm reportedly moves along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency authorities on Saturday in the early evening urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access so that people can get current status updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi reports.
People have been told to stay at home and away from windows, as well as moving garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow 28 to 33 meters per second.
Red Weather Warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning in southern Greece for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago, when I contacted you, there was a lot of wind and rain.
People were quite calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar even on Saturday evening.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also received no messages from Finns in distress.
In several ports in Greece, the ships did not operate on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, travel agents told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea traffic were expected.
It was reported on Saturday that Finnair is actively monitoring the weather situation.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari was allowed to admit that the worst competitor, Mercedes, was too hard a hit in the Russian GP time trial.
However, there is no reason to panic in a Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, the fourth-driver and teammate Sebastian Vettel clearly missed Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had a difficult time in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are - it's as simple as that.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go at the same rate they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is just a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, a rare delicacy was seen in Räikkönen's future team Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, who will replace Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final qualifying session.
For the Swedish driver, the tenth starting position is the best in over three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers did not drive at all, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkönen with the future in mind?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were at the beginning of the season, then the step forward has been a big one.
There will be a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper in the evening of Stuttgart went smoothly.
The German was a more proactive player in the ring, but he couldn't get a decent hit.
Clearly the taller Helenius controlled the match with his tough sets, which found their way well.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked Teper out with his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the veteran who fought in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get off the mat.
After securing the victory, Helenius aired quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then, for a moment, he changed his language to Finnish.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced immediately after the match.
It was a big win for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to qualify for the World Cup, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it has crossed my mind.
This does not make you any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is calling for a clear increase in the death toll.
The country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, said the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult Circumstances
Rescuers search for the trapped as well as the dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawesi: the port city of Palu and its neighbouring municipality of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and around 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard the cries of people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of clearing equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered an army for rescue and clearance work.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are cut in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitating response and long reflection caused a laughing stock
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected at Billnäs Ruukki.
During the interview round, each Miss Finalist was asked a question.
Finalists pulled the question from a glass bowl on stage.
In particular, the hesitant response of the finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused a sweet but benevolent laugh in the audience present.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what is the latest book that the Miss Finalist has read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good while before he started hesitantly.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is...," Anttikoski said, thinking.
The pause for reflection made the audience laugh, until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I've read is...
I read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is someone from economics," Anttikoski replied.
After his answer Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Miss Tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m. when last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm is abdicated.
Sike's apple and pear cake takes the tongue with it
This recipe is for those of you who have good, acidic apples from behind, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
You can also make this cake only from apples if you don't want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if you also add the pear to the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
Melt butter in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour as well as the melted butter to the foam.
Combine the cornstarch, or maizena, with the baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add the almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the baking tray with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the tray, and spread pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half of the dough over the pear slices and the apple slices over the dough.
Spoon the rest of the dough over the apple slices.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let cool in a pan and then undo on the serving platter.
Only cut the cake properly when it is cooled.
The cake is brittle in texture and crumbles easily because the dough contains almond and corn flour, which do not contain gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January
An international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held in Kuusamon Ruka for the first time in January.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary-related programme issues as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include Jens Lapidus, the star of Swedish detective fiction, and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who are found behind Erik Axel Sund's pen name.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also feature writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event will be represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organizers of the festival, the northern location, nature, the dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a setting for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who have analyzed the issue, have outlined two species of "coolness" consisting of slightly different features: generally attractive coolness and the contrasting dissident coolness.
According to the researchers, attractively cool people had many socially desirable traits: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and edge.
They craved experience and paid little attention to outsiders' assessments.
Both types were linked by good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
In the long run, the role of tough is not cool: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, partyed, joined good-looking groups, and sought the favor of others had an increased risk of substance abuse and crime as young adults.
In their relationships, they fared less well than their once more unnoticeable peers.
High-status luk susaus, designer bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with those wearing a regular market shirt than with those wearing a branded shirt - despite the fact that most chose to wear a branded shirt at the time of the introduction.
If you are on the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a cyclone hitting it - weather warning is screaming red
During the weekend, it can rain as much in southern Greece as it does in Finland in an average of six months.
Zorbas hurricane hits Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Embassy of Finland in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning for the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on Foreca's blog.
According to it, the strongest gusts of the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
In comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland in the early part of the week, blew at its highest point at just over 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of the storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimetres of water may come from the south of Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on their Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the Love Island Finland Anku that men drool over?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that Anku, a beauty drooled by several men in the Love Island Finland series, also appears as a crafting aunt in strange Youtube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen to, among other things, prepare an octopus from an old roll of paper towels.
Anku also shows in his sympathetic style how you can craft a hedgehog from tights that grows the right spikes.
Now let's make the Easter weeds grow, but let's do it in a little surprising way, Anku hints and shows sawdust, tights and the seeds of the weeds, which he makes into a hedgehog.

Valtteri Bottas shook and burst adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking a little tens of minutes after his pole position run by the Russian GP when he was in front of the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes' first-star Lewis Hamilton and was certainly mentally important to the Finnish driver who collected criticism this season.
It's a nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the settlement round.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on the pole once this year, in Austria (mid summer), so there's been quite a bit of time.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good laps again.
It is not easy to pass on the Sochi track, so the departure plays a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas had to answer the question of whether he will drive for victory tomorrow or whether there is going to be a Jesus of Hamilton approaching the World Cup title.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the pole, Bottas piled.
But as a team, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' lead to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas after the race, and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff had a taste too.
Lewis had the intention of defeating Valtteri, but he failed in turn seven.
Valtteri knows he has to tear everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears," Wolff exclaimed.
To the question whether the team will let Bottas and Hamilton drive straight, Wolff answered dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM-series of rally racing rarely ended.
Almost never before have the brothers ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula in the final rally around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik won the SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee secured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed the Finnish championship for him from the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen, who competes at Honda Civic, and co-driver Ville Mäkelä started the Turku round with a temper, because the starting points were clear: ranking in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give a handicap when some of the extra lights failed on the second special test.
It was a pretty blind spot for a third time.
In a situation like that, there's no room for snoops.
On Saturday, the pace of Jussi Tepo, who was only the second in the series, was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria's foreign minister called on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over," he said.
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, the seven-year war does not seem to end.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that a meeting with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is planned for October.
Not exactly a Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, received an extraordinary number of people on the screens.
In the United States, the full-blown Supreme Court judge-nomination drama got at least 20 million people in front of their television sets on Thursday.
At the time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor accusing him of harassment, were before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
According to preliminary results, the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online consultation was followed by several million more.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the live stream and CNN reported that it set its record for the year with 8.2 million live stream launches.
CNN's figure rises to more than 10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made 8.0 million launches.
Digital startups are the channels' own, TV viewership figures are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they are skyrocketing anyway.
Few reach 20 million
More than 20 million viewers in the United States usually only access sports matches, as well as the major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
The most watched program in the U.S. annual, the American Football League's NFL final game to the Super Bowl is certainly a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl attracted about 103 million people to the screens on NBC.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by well over 30 million people, according to Nielsen.
Top priority
The Supreme Court's appointment as a judge is an extremely significant case in the United States, as the posts are lifetime.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second seat opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on a number of issues he was a so-called balance language whose voice could determine the position of a nine-person court.
She was a supporter of the right to abortion and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, she decided with her vote that same-sex couples were entitled to marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the court in conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to be informed to parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Originally, the situation of the Kanta service was of course even more worrying: parents could not even see the health information or recipes of the infants.
A temporary correction to the situation was obtained in autumn 2016 for those under the age of 10.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be repaired, but the repair has taken an amazing amount of time.
The correction is now in place - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a case-by-case.
After that, with the layman's understanding, it's all about the push of a button: now that the wire is closed, let's open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her information to his or her parents - if he or she has bank IDs or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is paid, and the 10-year-old doesn't even get the bank codes.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the data of a fourth grader in primary school except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much a question of parental rights as it is a question of children's rights.
It is extremely important for the child's care that the parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations in which not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they are related to sexual health, of which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began cracking down on harassment allegations against Kavanaugh.
According to U.S. media reports, the FBI is investigating the allegations of harassment made by at least two women.
One of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must not last more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and may not be made public.
Man threatened to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to pull at the chamber as well.
Police say they have put the man in a police prison to "calm down".
Police were threatened with assault by a suspected assailant in Kajaani on the night of Saturday.
Officials are reporting an incident that began when a man in his 30s violently sued in a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer inside a food store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, he still hit her.
The triple assault led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to act aggressively at the police station.
The man kicked another policeman in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault police officers.
Police say they have sent the man to a police prison to "calm down".
The man is suspected of three counts of assault and violent opposition to an official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, and other international aid agencies are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi," says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF Finland's Information Manager.
Rescue efforts are being led by local authorities, but the need for further assistance is already apparent at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capability, says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue efforts are underway in the town of Palu, Sulawesi, but in the Donggala area a little further north, the situation is less clear.
There are still places where connections don't work.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
Buildings on Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors are found, they need shelter - tents at first, for example - and clean water.
In crisis situations, clean water is the most urgent.
First, people are most often able to offer water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Efforts are made to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported first, for example, by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and reuniting families is one part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid, on the other hand, is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, funds previously raised will be used for emergency assistance.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already begun a fundraising effort to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk to end Tesla chairmanship - $20 million fine for tweets
Elon Musk, the founder of the space rocket and electric car companies, avoids fraud charges in a deal with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk quits his position as chairman of Tesla's board of directors and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk stepped down as part of an agreement he entered into with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud for tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla, an electric car company, from the stock market, which caused the company's share price to rise rapidly.
Under the agreement, Musk will not serve as Tesla's chairman for three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and take two "independent leaders" into its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fine, Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine to the financial regulator.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange at a stock price of $420.
Tesla's stock price rose more than ten percent in 24 hours after the tweets, but declined later.
According to the SEC, Musk's allegations had no basis whatsoever.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed withdrawing from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board of directors.
Friday this week, the rate fell by 14 percent when the SEC announced a fraud charge.
It is expected that the agreement on the news will strengthen the company's course again.
The Last Judgment Is Not the Cause
Of course, the cathedral bells don't ring when the hands don't move.
It's a technical glitch.
The clock at the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The hands point to 12 o'clock.
It's like a mediocre horror movie: even when there was an exorcism in the church crypt and the organ was playing by itself.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some part has broken down and a new part is expected, says suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account states that the last judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of a fault.
