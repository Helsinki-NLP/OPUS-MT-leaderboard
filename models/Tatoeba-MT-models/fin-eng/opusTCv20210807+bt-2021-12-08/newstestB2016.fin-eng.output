9-year-old boy on the run from Tampere found
Police have been on a search mission for a nine-year-old boy's escape from Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The disappearance of a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the police situation centre, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life or health.
The boy's father told the Evening News around midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the debriefing.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again furiously tore goal difference in Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league over the weekend and continued to make his way into the Champions League as well.
The fight between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal kingship turned at least for a moment in favor of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid moved to the top of the all-time goal scorer record alone when he shot two hits in visitor Shahtar Donetsk's net for penalty kicks and one for the playing situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80, while Barcelona's Messi, who was tied with him before Tuesday, has a total of 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have been stumbling in the Italian Football League in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in Group D of the Champions League they started off strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus' Alvaro Morata just over ten minutes before the end.
City's attack was blunted by the absence of a knee-wrenching Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend's Premier League game, did not enter the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club United were also hard hit in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old linebacker Luke Shaw's away game lasted only 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the goal-attacking ManU kit so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to the hospital for treatment.
Memphis Depay took the guests to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's pleasure lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before the break in extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The goal scoring season in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria, an Argentinian who had changed his Manchester United shirt to a PSG nut.
Di Maria broke through to the right and picked up the ball in the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG has been ranked among the winners of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the league's minor clubs, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his professional starter Malmö FF for the first time.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in the Moscow CSKA lost Group B match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party calls for immediate resignation - President delivers wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech in the country's parliament again, which he gave at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe is fully alive.
The main opposition party, the MDC, called for Mugabe to resign because he is too old to govern.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had occurred solely at Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with China's impact on the country's economy before and now.
Germany and Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extra summit of EU leaders for next week due to the refugee crisis.
European Council President Donald Tusk, who heads the summits, assessed the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively those coming to Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the Home Affairs Ministers' table.
Professor admits in emergency call that he shot his girlfriend
Shannon Lamb, a university professor, asked in an emergency call for a voice shaking the police officer in his home and said he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive, and probably scared, and the professor said that the contact information for the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on a white document: "I am very sorry and wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the letter signed by Lamb read, according to authorities.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 miles to the school campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history kept dead at the door of his office on campus, who is believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford stated that the university officials were notified of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
Lamb took his own life when the police caught up with him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff remained behind locked doors, and officials were still trying to determine Lamb's motive.
Researchers worked out the details in both locations, and teachers who knew Lamb told them about the man, creating an image of a gifted but perhaps problematic teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to the Gautier police in Prentiss's place of death, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in a book he had written, in which he had given recognition to "the wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to lead an academic life.
Both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History, with a teaching staff of 17, many of whom attended courses for both men.
However, indications of problems emerged.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 school year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave due to some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policy meant that the dissertation Lamb had worked hard for would not automatically guarantee him an assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, police determined which route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before reaching Lamb, police had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear to the police why Lamb had gone to this particular house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the occupants of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started working as a geography and education teacher at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston how to play guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were sick of him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but no document says they have been married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and lived in a brick house on the river delta in the small town of Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Shawn O'Steen, the former husband of Prentiss, said he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was absolutely devastated," O'Steen said of his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at a modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb had played guitar and harmonica to a sparse crowd.
There was no denying that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who was killed, directed first-year seminars and was a specialist in Indian and colonial history," English professor Don Allan Mitchell said.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student union.
On the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered for a memorial service by candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students, and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nighttime event where the University Choir performed "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students to come back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been rectified, as police are now reporting that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was specified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not plan to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, a retailer of toys and baby products says it will offer its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work extra hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months to go until the holiday season, the trading season is fast approaching, and companies are preparing by hiring temporary labour for stores, as well as for the shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was an important moment in Michael J. Fox's career.
The opening night also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed there was an empty seat next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox said in the trailer for the upcoming Back in Time documentary.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time documentary is related to the Back to the Future films, and the documentary interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg, in addition to Fox.
Back to the Future was released 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely the time travel film of all time for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in select cinemas starting in October.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military efforts, stating that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his plans to meet with the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would coincide with the United Nations General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month.
Ban deplored the fact that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has created a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, which brought about Iran's nuclear deal.
8 Chapters on Support Polls: Is Donald Trump Serious?
Attempts have been made to label Trump as an idler.
He has also been considered a joke.
Some predict a collapse for Trump.
There has been (so far) no effort in Republican circles to pull Trump down from the polls.
Ten of the eleven national polls show Donald Trump with double-digit support figures. Some are already seriously considering what it says in practice about the real estate mogul's candidacy opportunities.
However, the elections are only in the early stages.
No one has yet announced that Trump will be elected as the Republican nominee.
Experts recall that Rick Perry, who was at the polls at this time in 2011, was allowed to give way to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom ultimately won the nomination in any state.
Trump would be difficult in the general election for many reasons.
Outside factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and are beginning to dig their way to bring him down.
The following recent poll data shows that a real estate mogul cannot be ignored with a shrug:
There has been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, according to a Monmouth University poll, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive image of a real estate mogul.
By mid-July, as many as 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now, six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten have a negative image.
These numbers also hold in states where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinnipiac poll, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would welcome Trump's candidacy.
In a poll by CNN and ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were highly satisfied or satisfied with Trump's potential election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is getting almost as enthusiastic reception as Trump (43 percent would be very pleased with Carson's candidacy and 40 percent with Trump's candidacy).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, who has a corresponding support share of 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as the party's candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomp and offensive comments. 52 percent of Republicans nationwide consider the properties of a real estate mogul to be appropriate for the president. The views are evidenced by a poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the convention is held first: According to Quinnipiac-gallup, 52 percent of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities appropriate for the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
However, according to the ABC and Post polls, 44 percent believe Trump is not able to do the job effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament inappropriate for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They are starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is the most likely candidate for the party, according to a poll by CNN and ORC, four out of ten believe Trump has a chance.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall: Republicans have not had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal in the past.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans support the other candidate, Trump will outdo almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents are divided into supporters of the various candidates.
A Monmouth University poll in early September revealed that in a fictitious duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win a larger following.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would win Trump by 19 points in a fictitious duel.
A small majority of Trump supporters say they have already made the decision to vote.
According to a poll released Tuesday by CBS and the NYT, more than half of Trump supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a confident voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's fiercest rival at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already elected their candidate are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
Since Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico rapists in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will expel important Hispanic voters from Republican ranks and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to poll results released Monday by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently garner about half of the Republican vote in total. The popularity is significantly increased by the fact that both have been nominated as outsiders.
Republicans want a fresh face instead of a political one, according to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans thought so.
These two candidates are also angry at Washington.
According to a poll conducted by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican action in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are on the brink of rage.
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance in Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
Labour's new frontman, Jeremy Corbyn, is set to stand up for the first time in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn asks the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with the media and Labour following the man with a hard eye.
Corbyn has called for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corbyn's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection with the meeting. Corbyn will be put to a parliamentary test now after the gathering of the shadow government and his speech at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Confederation of Trade Unions TUC on Tuesday.
The Labour frontman's decision to remain silent at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the British Air War, held during the national anthem on Tuesday, has received criticism from several Tory party representatives.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn's representative stated that Corbyn stood during the national anthem, in silence respecting the Royal Air Force's heroism in the Battle for Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC's Two's Newsnight that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite his opposition to the monarchy.
Ten or so shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party initially supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political disagreements over Britain's membership of the EU and the government's tightening of the conditions for granting benefits have piled up in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn said Labour would propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, the shadow government's Minister of Labor and Pensions, Smith, stated that the party's position is very clear: it opposes only the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron faces in the past decade as leader of the Tory Party.
The Labour leader who promised a new approach to politics says he has selected questions for Cameron from 30,000 proposals he received from the public.
Corbyn, elected from the constituency of Islington North, said there were too many clashes during Question Time, promising to avoid clever words and mudslinging, saying he would instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that shadow minister Angela Eagle will fill in for him during Question Time, for example, when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Corbyn has also thrown in the air the idea that others could also occasionally make their voices heard, saying that he had discussed the matter with John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons.
Following Corbyn's rise to party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppeteer-like politics, often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted failure in his effort.
Since being televised for the first time in 1990, Question Time has been seen as a key measure of a leader's judgment, control of the House of Commons, and position. However, critics say Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reform.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless youth to photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A group of former street children have found a meaningful way to learn and earn money.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit photography studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home region and earn money at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who was among the first to graduate through the project.

Pound strengthens as UK wages rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller pulled the FTSE 100 index up.
Between May and July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
Faster-than-expected growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1% and its exchange rate was quoted at $1,5505.The pound also strengthened against the euro, and was quoted at €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose 1.49 percent and ended up at 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate was up 20 percent when the company received a preliminary bid from rival company AB InBev.
If implemented, the deal would unite the world's two largest brewing companies and bring brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under one roof.
Burberry's share rose 0.9 percent in the wake of positive results from the rival Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury goods.
Richemont's most recent sales figures are better than forecast, with sales also showing upward trends in Burberry's key markets in China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in a share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The Mondi shares of the packaging and paper group were the biggest fallers with a 4.3% drop when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
JD Sports' rate rose 3.1 percent after the sports company announced that its pre-tax profit would increase by 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, chairman of the management team at JD Sports, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, the increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
According to Cowgill, rising labor costs could jeopardize JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labor.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi's avalanche
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from Aldi's invasion of southern and western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain IGA retail market share in southern and western Australia against Aldi's $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centers and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through marketing on mainstream media and social media, as well as organizing events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers samples in IGA stores, and retailers sell tickets to South Australian Football League games to regular customers at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to release more detailed information about its defense strategy on September 29, when the Food, Alcohol and Hardware Wholesale will hold its annual Investment Strategy Day.
This is a significant market, with South and West Australia accounting for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the margin is higher than the IGA retail network in the eastern states.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their parochialism, and IGA traders have a much higher market share in the region than NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with South Australia having 30% and Western Australia having 24%, while the eastern states only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will capture 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores. The chain eats sales from all players, but especially from those who are independent of the chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that sales of IGA merchants could reach $360 million and Metcash sales could reach $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year, reaching sales of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so a loss of food sales and volume could mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes," Kierath says.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan shows that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, chief portfolio manager at Magellan Financial Group, told a conference in Melbourne that it was highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has declined to publicly comment on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's food business, serving 1200 IGA dealers, has seen a 43% drop from 2012 levels, showing a decrease in debt financing as pressures on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of more than $150 million to meet Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products on a weekly basis. The chain wants to support retailers in renovating their stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh produce and improve the food selection of the store's own brands.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, price revision and store renewal plans are well underway, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves special mention for his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a bystander victim in the recent Nick Kyrgios-related event. Kokkinakis deserves special mention instead of criticism.
Kokkinakis, a younger side of the duo named "Special K", was put in an unfavorable spotlight when evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in a qualifying match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the referee had to twice separate the two rivals. "Wawrinka should have given Kyrgiosis and me a beating," Harrison stated.
At the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis frustratedly struck the bat field when powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinakis.
Currently, the teen star is in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe Thanasi has been drawn into the controversy," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the game at the U.S. Open. He is by no means the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of what he has done.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative behaviour at the US Open, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for 19 years old, he works hard and completes the team well. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He trains hard, is in good shape and a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged by his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team for an important round starting on Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all sides. However, he supports the return of Canberra's breeder as a long-term reinforcement of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus entirely on the matches instead of the controversy surrounding Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray, among others, have pointed out, the youngster has to grow up in the public spotlight. He deserves the criticism he receives for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange his own peace. I believe it's best for both the team and Nick."
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared a state of emergency, closed its southern borders from the direction of Serbia on Tuesday and apprehended illegal migrants, with the aim of preventing the influx of migrants.
Chaos erupted along the border as hundreds of migrants flocked to no-man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain on the road between checkpoints in their tents indefinitely
Frustration began to surface.
While a police helicopter was flying in the air above the migrants, they chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some went on a hunger and drink strike in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it would not accept migrants being sent back to Hungary at the same time as more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not add to the damage.
The situation will have to be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and also in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day later when a 28-nation bloc failed in its attempts to develop a common migration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for the 40,000 influxes of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and the meeting raised the hope that an agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which EU member states would accept 120,000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
However, Hungary did not put its hope in the immediate actions of Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency developed so that authorities in two southern regions were allowed to take more effective measures, i.e. to close roads and speed up the legal processes related to asylum.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that the fence on the Serbian border is already complete.
Charlie D'Agata, a correspondent for CBS News, reported that even the prisoners took part in a tender for finishing the barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, argued that most of the people arriving are living standards refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek refuge. The view contrasts sharply with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to a new law that came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre-high barbed wire fence that the government has built on the southern border in the direction of Serbia.
"Because of the situation caused by the mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis in the country," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to approve military action, which is expected next week, and for several days now, journalists from the Associated Press news agency at the border have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Orban's internal security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had arrested 45 border crossings immediately at the border and 15 further away.
People who cross the border by damaging the fence are now in police custody, charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossings on the Serbian border on Tuesday, one border crossing being closed by a railcar covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took over the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungarians opened a shop in a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 fit in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street connecting Serbia and Hungary, and people announced they were on a hunger and drink strike until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders contracted by half, according to a national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support rate is still double-digit in the race for the Democratic National presidential nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has narrowed the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47 percent of the Democratic vote (a drop from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (an increase from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden has yet to announce his possible departure for the presidential race, with a 15 percent vote in favor among Democrats.
More than five months before the primary, it's too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they're rooting for.
However, Clinton supporters are more certain of their choice than those of other candidates.
Since a poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support from several Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders' camp.
Clinton still has a solid lead among women and moderates, but the lead has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly, and she has only a 5% bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost her lead among Democrats under 50, and she is now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage over older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in the polls against Sanders among the Liberals was double-digit, but now Sanders has taken a five-pointer neck into Clinton in this group.
About half of Democrats say they will be happy to support Clinton if she is elected as the party's candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with minor reservations, and 15% would only support her because she is a candidate.
6% would not support Clinton.
It should come as no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters, too, if she was selected as a candidate.
There is more dispersal of views among those who do not currently support Clinton, with only about a quarter enthusiastically supporting her.
48% of Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35% of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton voters are asked freely to describe why they support her candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's correct experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton supporters also mention his affiliation with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, common views and chances of winning the actual election are mentioned.
The vice president is still weighing his potential candidacy, and 57% of Democratic voters would like him to enter the race, but a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When Democratic voters are asked about the second most popular candidate for the party, Biden is chosen by the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic nomination race, Hillary Clinton will increase her head start over Sanders, and with Sanders on board, the head start will be 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton to be the candidate with the best chance of winning the actual election, but that percentage has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, number two, is a long way from Clinton, but more and more believe Biden has a chance of winning the actual election.
Democratic voters, however, prefer views on factual issues to candidates' chances of winning.
Voters do not find any of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates unacceptable.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable in their characteristics.
Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are considered by most to be honest, trustworthy, and a type of leader.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered the leader type.
As many as 30 percent of Democratic voters do not consider Clinton honest and reliable, while Sanders 15 percent do, and 27 percent do not know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden's views as close to the voters' own ideology.
For all the features, about a quarter have no opinion about Sanders.
When voters are asked about their views on Hillary Clinton's use of private email and her own server as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation, and that hasn't changed their perception of Clinton.
Americans more broadly disagree.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with the Clinton report, and only a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come to light.
A majority of Americans feel that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While own party voters consider Clinton honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when the views of all voters are asked: Clinton considers only 32 percent honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy either.
Both Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates polled, Biden, Carson, and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, a lot of people don't have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters, and the margin of error of the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson Reaches Out to Donald Trump in National Support Poll
According to a recent poll by CBS News and the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
The two candidates garnered more than half the votes in the new poll, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters across the country, Trump still has strong support. The voter turnout has risen from 23% in a CBS poll conducted before Fox News' debate last month. According to a poll released on Tuesday, the voter turnout is 27%.
However, Carson's support was set to skyrocket in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support in all segments of the population, and in the higher education group, he narrowly outstrips Trump.
Other candidates, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, remain far behind, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support being among the weakest and having dropped from 10 percent last month to now 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6% of the vote.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6% one way or the other. The survey was conducted in September.
According to the latest CNN and ORC poll released last week, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19% of Republicans supporting him, compared to 32% for Trump.
Also in the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was clearly ahead of Carson.
In the men's meeting last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in a community ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are being charged with murder.
Chun "Michael" Deng was brutally beaten by members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity of Baruch College (City University of New York) at a baptism in September 2013. Police said the fraternity failed to deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was deemed to have contributed to his death.
Officials said the victim's eyes were blindfolded, a backpack filled with nearly 30 pounds of sand had been placed on his back, and he had been repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target placed on the other side of an icy field.
Deng is reported to have first complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to police, members of Pi Delta Psi's fraternity did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waiting an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Police Commissioner Chris Wabner told a press conference that members still had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact fraternity chairman Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the tools, putting the benefit of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng was unable to be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the hazing of a fraternity, as at least one student a year has died as a result of hazing since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Societies and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
A grand jury in Monroe County presented five members of the fraternity to be charged with third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the fraternity face charges of hazing and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to hold not only individuals accountable, but also the organisation that officially or unofficially approved the hazing," Wagner told a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College put a ban on the student union, and the national student union resigned from the local department.
This is how the Federal Reserve's (Fed) interest rate hike will affect
The rise in interest rates and the upswing in the stock market will falter, the return on securities will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
That's what we know.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will all take and how long the effects will last.
In economics, in particular, we find an indication of timing in history.
The recession has arrived in up to 11 months since the first interest rate hike and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, though not always. The deciding factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, central bank officials have already been under a great deal of stress that investors should pay attention not to when interest rates start to rise, but to how long it will take for the situation to normalise.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
Ultimately, however, market participants may find that any fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The Central Bank's first withdrawal after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics told his clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect interest rates to gradually normalise to a fairly low level.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Based on historical trends, here are examples of how impacts can be seen in different areas of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the foreshadowing of interest rate hikes can add to the instability for a while.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be a stagnation of interest income on capital after the first drawdown for 12 to 24 months, perhaps again reflecting a lag in monetary policy," a Deutsche Bank analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of interest rate increases.
In a more detailed 35-year period, the market usually sees a sharp rise, around 14 percent, fairly steady for the next 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), after 500 days, the situation normalizes, and the average interest rate return after six stock cycles is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management at Barron's.
According to Deutsche, the impact on equities usually strengthens slightly later in the cycle and interest income begins to decline.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works for it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank's key interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, with 118 policy rate hikes since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been below 4.5 percent.
While the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 percent, many didn't think it would last, and the third quarter is at 1.5 percent, according to Atlanta's regional central bank.
Raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation can be risky and one might ask whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the key interest rate throughout the year, and the focus is on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the drawdown at this meeting, futures trading shows only a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles to this day have been in a supercycle in which pre-inflationary GDP is also rising very rapidly as the boom begins," the report states.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the control period.
The cycle is by far the longest the central bank has waited since the last recession, with a record of 35 months, now in its 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been volatile as the market foreshadows interest rate hikes, and the pattern is repeated on the capital side as well.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on stocks when the central bank changes rates.
For bonds, the return appears to change direction as soon as the first up/down cycle is triggered.
At the end of the recovery cycle, returns will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will bring long-term and short-term bonds closer together and smooth the curve.
"High-yield bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-yield securities analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly enough, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future reversal of the central bank.
"In addition to the dollar strengthening and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjusting to the tightening of financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is straight, credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased, all typical of markets in a situation where the central bank is tightening policies.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mainly in the US market will benefit as interest rates fall and local products begin to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as the stronger dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market and the debt more expensive.
"History shows that quality stocks will be more profitable over the next three months of compounding," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their clients.
Firms with a strong balance sheet outperformed firms with a weak balance sheet after interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares also fared better than the lower quality ones, by an average of 4 and 3 percentage points respectively.
"The debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable-rate debt lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects will appear.
Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for being too popularized.
According to Bingham, it is now difficult to separate the channel from its commercial rival.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards as a copy of the Brits only.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel. The accusations add to the pressure on the station to prove that it also offers other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC management that the broadcaster's radio channel is becoming too populist and the channel is not much different from its commercial rival anymore.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be shifting in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, held last December, also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, held for the first time last year, appear to be a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of how instead of new and different, we are simply imitating what is already on the market," Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations and stated that there is significantly more live music and educational content available on BBC Radio 3 than the commercial competitor.
"From Radio 3 I learned things about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and making music is in a class of its own.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director General.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey stated that the station needed to work even harder to keep the public interested, as the British are more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only heavily criticized BBC channel for entering the territory of commercial channels, in a hearing with the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice talent show, which was bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
"The program is not much discussed, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the programme presented by the BBC1, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as the star judges, was produced in a manner typical of the BBC.
In addition, Collins demanded that the company find a hit show in its own garage the next time it launches a new entertainment series.
Collins, however, refused to rule out that The Voice would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be used for other entertainment formats.
E-commerce growth slowest ever in August, perhaps due to Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
Online sales have been recorded since 2000, and last month was the slowest ever.
E-commerce strengthened three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November can curb shopping.
Over a decade of e-commerce conquest has depopulated many of Britain's shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilizing, with new sales figures showing only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest during the entire time that e-commerce sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilizing, with new sales figures showing only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to 2000's, it's clear that growth will level out over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor-in-chief of the IMRG, told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers embraced mobile shopping.
"As a result, more and more people were able to buy online, and for many it was possible to buy in a different environment, for example from a home sofa.
With mobile shopping now more moderate, growth could level off."
Black Friday, originating in America, is considered one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the day celebrated on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, five times as many online shoppers as normal made many merchants' websites crash.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which causes consumers to crowd around for offers, can curb buying desires at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion stores.
Mecca Buries Crane Accident Victims, Bin Laden Family Accountable
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral takes place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Binladin Group, a major construction company, is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
Bodies were carried high in the air as Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane that fell on the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Enormous crowds of people dressed in white had gathered in the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A convoy of mourners passed through a pilgrimage site where a fallen construction crane had penetrated through the roof of the mosque a day earlier on top of the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia is demanding that Bin Laden's construction family company be held responsible for the accident, which injured an additional 394 people.
The bodies of the 29 victims killed in the Mecca Grand Mosque crane accident were carried on the streets.
After the crane fell among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents, who were embarking on their annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have promised that a hajj pilgrimage will take place as thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the pilgrimage.
King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to an Arabic press release, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report on the matter in detail, but according to the English-language press release, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to crash in the Grand Mosque yard. Thousands of Muslims will head to the Grand Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a press release on the crane accident, and representatives of the group have not been reached for a statement.
The king also accused the group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and cooperating with meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca as part of Binladin Group's gigantic construction project.
For decades, the Bin Laden family has had close contact with the ruling family in Saudi Arabia, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the late leader of Al Qaeda, was an apostate boy who had been abandoned by his family in the 1990s.
The crane disaster, which occurred in heavy rain and strong winds, occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still hospitalized.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (about €250,000) to the families of the victims and the permanently disabled.
The rest of those injured in the accident receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says cheap Eastern European workforce is behind the phenomenon
British people hire home handymen more often than before, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled, self-employed workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workmen will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, Principal Correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer the hammering and painting work of the home to authors from Eastern Europe.
Hammering and painting skills seem to be scarce these days.
More and more British people are hiring home handymen to handle the home's work, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home refurbishment supply chain. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at low prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders, while 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury is in need of more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, demographic trends should be taken into account, as more and more women living alone are also renovating their homes.
"The staff at our stores are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of product purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women at the helm of companies in the UK's FTSE 100 index, and has also reorganized the company's management team so that there are equal numbers of male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with exactly 50% of its staff being women, including CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women for the leadership team."
There is a decline in Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures, even though the company worked hard after the closures of stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three aces government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other employee central organisations began to be forced right away and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the extensive demonstration of workers.
A lot of people think that's when reason stands.
Ask them if they should go on strike when things are not going well.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to participate in the protest, but are going to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring oneself a criminal would have been the political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people by the million-member trade unions does not take much time, but it does give something to think about.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the point of view of the attractiveness of the trade union movement's activities, the violent solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling on their own weight, it is now time for the unions to finally get to the point of defending the rights of the worker, visibly and properly.
The government may thus wish to perhaps strengthen the role of the trade union movement, as membership in the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever you think of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
Industrial production, for example, has been declining for 31 consecutive months.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline, and unemployment will rise.
These things should be forcing everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta on a hard austerity course: Aiming for savings of 8.5 million, staff to be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will begin a savings program with the goal of cutting costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will begin co-operation negotiations concerning the entire personnel, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
An additional two million will be saved from other activities.
The negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates an actual deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by budget cuts made by the government.
During this fiscal year, the university will make about 2.6 million in deficit.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million euros and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university's total budget is about 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten percent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research as well as a decrease in corporate funding on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli from the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the decrease in supplementary funding is reflected in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will begin on Tuesday next week and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland for railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the UK's largest rail companies," Souter says.
Rail transport is to open up to competition gradually.
The first will be commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, there is long-distance traffic.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the plans of Onnibus are welcomed by the Ministry of Transport.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe.
U.S. Central Bank Time of Interest Decision
The entire world is watching the Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible interest rate hike for the first time in nearly a decade.
More than half of economists who believed that the central bank would raise interest rates last week now expect the central bank to maintain interest rates at the current rate of 0-0.25 percent, according to a survey conducted by 80 economists at Reuters.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has kept interest rates close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus trigger the normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been in a relatively good state, and recovery has brought trillions of additional dollars to the balance sheet and has contributed little to inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not so rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications to the contrary.
The decision is set to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 Central European Time.
Delta State University shooter leaves apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before a colleague was shot later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message apologizing for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, officials said on Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called 911 around 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot a man.
In an emergency call, Lamb called the police at his home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that's no harm to anyone but is probably scared.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but the man did not tell them.
Lamb also did not give a motive for the shooting.
Police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, as well as a handwritten note from Lamb that read: "I am very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 miles to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his own life late Monday when police caught up with him.
University principal William LaForge said he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lamb was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of a love triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for seven years, described his ex-wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Lindsay Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss, said Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles noted that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and also told of a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he was not going to jail.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, escaped on foot, ran into the woods, and took his own life.
According to a resume on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Dim stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 was arrested for drug possession.
Everything that has happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw sidelined for months after two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is unfortunately forced to stay on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the field again this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno in the PSV defensive area while fifteen minutes were in play.
Shaw received first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg and is hospitalized," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after for surgery.
The young man who joined Manchester United at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now injured after some great gameplay.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when his leg breaks in two places, he'll be on the sidelines for half a month and he won't be playing in the block stage anymore.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten away with it when the situation did not result in a red card penalty kick.
The match's referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can decide for yourself, but I think it was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged reckless tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't put into words how overwhelmed I am. My recovery starts here and I'll come back stronger than ever."

The English defender has a special reason to recover to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very serious injury," said the PSV coach.
"In situations like this, all parties are always very sorry.
It is never the intention of the players to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing for Mexico in the Van Gaal-led Netherlands only at the 2014 World Cup.
"He is very sorry, as he did not intend to harm the opponent. It is sad to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I myself did not see the situation.
All I saw was a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this can be," Moreno told SBS6.
"I feel really bad. I'm very sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Before long, every parent will notice that the child learns his or her favorite book almost by heart.
Except you see David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the prime minister chose Lorax, a teaching environmental story by Dr. Seuss published in 1971.
In a text posted on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching, and creative, and has a powerful message. I like to read it to my kids because there's always some picture or message that we haven't noticed before."
Sounds good, except that the next point Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, with new characters and details added to complete the short original text.
"In the town of Tarville, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by realizing her biggest dream: to see the real tree," the text states. In the version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, Ted had no object of infatuation.
If this isn't suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partially consistent with the plot summary for the Internet Movie Database film Lorax, which begins: "In the town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so alien to him. Greedy Kerskanen disposes of trees and manufactures Tarviks from them despite the objections of the title character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, moustacheed creature who protects the forests.
Likely, a PR task of this kind, of minor importance, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to one who as a child has not read Lorax 20 times in a row,.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said that the text probably came from the Cameron constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further, but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being absent from the England team, but it's still tough
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the 3-0 Test series defeat of the team selected by England for the tour, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of an away win, either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but there are good players on the batting team and the team's attitude is strong - they don't have a bad experience from 2012, just youthful positivity.
As a spherical player, Moeen Ali evolves as a spiral pitcher, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is clearly hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and brutal truth is that cricketers are judged by the results.
Joe Root, for example, is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best selectors.
A few 50-point matches would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits more runs for Yorkshire.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he didn't do as well as he could have, which doesn't surprise me, because he's a team player first and foremost.
The question of how long a Test-beater gets a chance to make an impact is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven national games — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton was given the opportunity in both home and away games.
The only thing to complain about is perhaps that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming to the team and he's a hitter that I highly appreciate.
He is an unknown player in cricket, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start batting with Cook to get an extra twist pitcher into the game while holding four quick pitchers, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see any obstacle to the top pitcher being able to hit here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricketer.
Moe may not have accomplished much on his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test matches as the first substitute player before being able to start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup pitcher, and from what I have seen of him, he has proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his stats — an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher — and this can be a long shot, but not many twist pitchers have shown they are ready, and the selectors decided to take the young player.
He learns a lot during this game.
Outside of the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker, Mahela Jayawardene, as a Test match advisor can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men in the sport, bringing a lot of experience because he has played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball section of the game trip and brings with it both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he's always seemed to fit international cricket, whether he's a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he's got some useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a stimulant.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day games, Root got a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, neither the coaches nor the selectors determine the schedule of the match.
And it must be borne in mind that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp may win if economy is in bad shape 2017
David Cameron's half-hearted renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is in deeper and deeper waters every day, even without the pleasurable Jeremy "yes or no" Corbynik's election to head the Labour Party or the TUC making a violent mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained how, in many crises, the EU is crumbling — even if not all of them are an act of their own; some Member States are fed up with Britain's self-righteous agenda, which includes divisive concessions and damaging Treaty changes that they really do not even want.
At the TUC annual congress in Brighton, it was decided that they too would not be comfortable in the EU if it eroded social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda, for example.
The prime minister and chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral talks in the capitals of various countries, snap a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking figures, return home, and say they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
"Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and suggests that an increasing number of short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point of no longer caring whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's prudent chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain will have a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help the selfie Britons, who could better use their energy to try and stop Scotland from leaving the UK, and they do not want that either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may plan to deliberately throw useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK's 2017 popular election campaign to hasten the Brexit process.
"Renegotiations were an arranged affair, and there was nothing left for Britain to do with the renegotiations."
Europeans know how the British press preys and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, much like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, whose result advocated 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone will distantly remember Boris Johnson, the quirky Euro-opportunist who became known as our 'EU Direct Banana Correspondent' in Brussels in the early 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemy.
They include tax evaders, phone hacks, and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought roughly the same about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you for both lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more blairless in his opposition to the referendum. After all, Blair agreed to the EU constitution, which was then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in a referendum in 2005, Blair conveniently got away with it.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corbyn who patted me on the back with a friendly hand at Westminster on Monday. I told him he didn't have any more time to waste on me. There may be a risk he'll adopt Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s. It was a mistake and still is.
Time may pass, but Corbyn must develop a coherent strategy for socializing with the media. Not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, on whose BBC couch he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of Ukip and Tory can probably answer yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told on radio and television this week when her inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move for Corbyn to appoint the rugged John McDonnell as Shadow Treasury Secretary.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father had trouble being disloyal on television to his Labour party colleagues without going too far and losing his seat in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to remaining in the EU "under all circumstances". McDonnel did not say that, nor did Corby's colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whether or not Corbyn wanted to convey any cheesy image, it must be remembered that he even touched me. Message discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the social media slump where paranoia and deception simmer.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as McDonnell has said.
At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equivocation of EU membership fits in with the Bennite blockade economy and anti-capitalist past. Discussions no longer belong to a narrow circle of leftist dissidents, for whom the idea that similarity unites is a central tenet in doctrinal strife.
There has also been an escalation in NATO. Tom Watson is unwavering in the fact that Corbyn is not campaigning for the departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have skeptical voters. Why should they make concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States has already been rather disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts under the Tory government, which I was reminded of on Monday when the British Influence Security Forum was launched.
Experts criticise UK authorities' statements on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government-funded institution that e-cigarette smoking is 95 percent less harmful than traditional smoking came about at a meeting of 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized the evidence presented in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) e-cigarette report.
PHE described its report, published last month, as "a groundbreaking and comprehensive review of the results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet Medical Journal last month took on a "substantially weak foundation" on which PHE's main conclusion is based.
In addition, two researchers at the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were based on "rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated the following: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modeling of research results.
The claim comes from one meeting of 12 people, which was convened to develop a model based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The model was intended to unify participants' views on the harms of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled into a study.
According to McKee and Capewell, supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose former independent research by the CEO has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, in the sustainability report, the CEO demonstrated his support for BAT's public health activities.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer. However, the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
There is no report on the criteria for selecting the panel's composition, but there are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom acknowledge their involvement as an industrial financier.
However, some of the participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco manager.
According to McKee and Capewell, the team's research report shows that there is no conclusive evidence that the products are harmful to a broad range of products and meet their criteria.
However, neither links nor shortcomings are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to a PHE report, so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, the claims have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke throughout life die from tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be studied further.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative dangers compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths per year in the UK, and smoking costs public health services £2 billion per year.
Responsible behaviour requires that we clearly present the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the harm they cause is a fraction of the harm of conventional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, who was in charge of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial rivals would give their right hand for hit shows such as the soap opera Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should only be used to make programs that other television stations do not.
He criticized the performance of programmes likely to reach smaller audiences on the BBC at the same time as programmes with large audiences from competitors, as well as on BBC4, for example.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said he had been trying for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC, unsuccessfully.
"I don't agree with the idea of the BBC buying formats and broadcasting programmes that clearly belong to the programming of some competing channel," Johnson told the House of Lords' Communications Committee, which was investigating the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its supply, at least for programmes that are not produced and bought by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice on prime time because it wants to have as broad a support as possible in the future.
If no other channel cares about the show, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should be used to fund programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, although it is a production of its own.
A lot of channels would give their right hand for that.
I don't see how this serves the public service of the broadcaster.
I don't think that would be a loss for the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in the lead of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2008. He thinks the BBC has good ratings because ambitious people work for the company and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are in line with those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programmes for the BBC's niche audience are shown on BBC4, where ratings can't be measured most of the time, but the programmes fulfill their purpose. "The BBC can say with its hypocritical missions of broadcasting fees of £4 billion that it did make special programmes that nobody was watching."
"The BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
Regarding broadcasting fees, Johnson stated, "I challenge you to find another system that is as old-fashioned in the sense of who gets the most out of it.
Of course, everyone thinks £150 a year is cheap, but people for whom it's a big amount, especially if you don't look at the BBC very much."
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also gave his own views on the committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new ones "to inform, teach and entertain".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any educational programmes on the BBC's current offering — on television 1% and on radio 0.1%. He adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and adjust its mission to a new faith: "information, light and entertain".
On the question of collaboration, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts from events such as the Proms festival, whose concerts were broadcast only a fraction last year. "The BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offering available online as well," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the nematode changes direction when subjected to ultrasound.
Scientists have been breeding worms with a genetically altered nervous system, which allows the worms to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when subjected to ultrasound, the frequency of which is above the auditory range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion neurons that have been genetically modified to have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More on this subject: Scientists monitor brain activity with light
According to the researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). The method utilizes ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with a stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS therapy is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
The shuttle pods do not normally respond to ultrasound. Chalasani noticed, however, that the worms begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that propagate inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels found in some of the worm cell membranes.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the nematodes by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms in such a way that TRP4 ion channels appeared on some of the nerves that control their movement.
When ultrasound was directed to the modified worms, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and moved on to the worms, leaving a signal in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat reminiscent of optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate neurons with the help of light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain under study by means of optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, penetrate the cell easily, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and viral therapy, human neurons can be momentarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal Torture Equipment —At Your Door!
The ads are a disgrace to Britain's arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International anti-arms trade show video.
Terrifying killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leg braces!
Cluster bombs!
Remote tasers that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The happy sound and cartoons clearly reveal that this advert for the world's largest arms fair is a parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government's efforts to sell weapons to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which is held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in Docklands, London.
More on this subject: DSEI gun fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
There are also posters popping up at bus stops and subway cars that require a second look.
"Important announcement: do you take the subway from 15th to 18th of September?" The announcement is similar in appearance to the announcements of the London Underground.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked for help to close the arms fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy's Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London with a £6 "advertisement hacking kit" with hex keys that allegedly access about a third of the world's bus stop ad poster stands.
Transport for London is no laughing matter for poster vandalism.
One of the prank ads for the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political works outside the galleries for the public to see.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art is brought to the real world, and many people move on to work with activists from protest movements.
One of the anti-arms posters greets users of public transport on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed over 100,000 times over the course of 24 hours via Facebook, designed without compensation by advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the narrator have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, VCCP's Artistic Director, wondered about the absence and the empty spot of trade show advertising in the ExCeL's calendar of events. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, shady corporate video, but the bright colors and animation attract attention better."
"They've done a great job and helped us bring out the fairs where illegal trafficking in torture equipment is taking place," says Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not trafficked illegally right at our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative contribution of the arms fair is on display in the exhibition spaces themselves at ExCeL, where exhibitors make use of the huge euphemisms for their merchandise.
In a press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. military for a "portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "special-shaped warhead that effectively penetrates directly to the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dormitories
I moved into a student dorm 11 years ago, I was an innocent 19-year-old, and I still believed in berets and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I provoked and the countless, long complaints about others.
The most important lessons can be summarized in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory is a stressful experience at its mildest and, at its worst, shocking.
It's easy to get rambunctious: you tell everyone where you are from, whether you liked the gap year and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because that's just yeast extract, hahaha, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe: show interest and ask questions of others.
Asking questions guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your lashes were on fire and these people were sharing fire extinguishers.
Give others space.
Private rooms often serve as drinking stalls, cinemas, and common lounges, but a private room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More on this topic: Don't even think about combining dating and college studies
For introverts, college is a tough place.
A room of its own should be a place of tranquillity. However, many dormitories form a social culture of wandering from room to room and forming lifelong friendships.
This kind of culture can be a nightmare for someone who needs a place to recover.
It's not possible to say in this environment, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to go away so I can recharge the energy I used to socialize with you."
Try to observe if one of your fellow students is tired of social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my dorm who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies conveniently when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a '50s, slightly odd case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small.
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and a tasteful surprise can leave them with a positive image of you.
This, of course, requires you to have reasonable baker skills.
If you serve unhappy lumps of flour, sugar, and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offence in student dormitories.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but is it okay to pour a drop of someone else's milk can into their tea?
Always check with the milk carton owner.
Most likely you will get permission, even if the milk quotes the owner of the can.
I understand that it's annoying when someone steals something from you, but try to handle the situation as adultly as possible — unlike my own college buddy, who poured detergent into his milk as a punishment for milk thieves.
The woman is now in prison.
Do not make noise when others are trying to sleep or study.
Not only because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that you dig a hole for every other person...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the resident in the next room to adjust the beat of the music down, for it was three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally got quiet in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, took a three-hour exam, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought that your college buddy was your future spouse, started dating, divorced, and had to see him every day, and lost the visitation rights of your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if a college friend is definitely not the only one, try to control what you want.

Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation in Kitee - House planned as reception centre stained in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was carried out on a student accommodation in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations for underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping quarters of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the Evangelical Folk High School of Kitee.
The windows and walls of the dormitories of the Kansanopisto were stained with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the dormitories' windows, according to the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luukkainen, who is responsible for youth social guarantee education at Kansanopisto, an estimated ten people were in the vandalized building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move around, so some could have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
The Folk High School houses people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in the cluttered building has a-status.
Some are studying in the comprehensive school for adults, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," says Luukkainen.
A status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a press conference was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We have had more than a decade of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
According to Luukkainen, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men and had been travelling in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of the youth weekend night, as this topic has now been afloat.
Nothing more serious than that," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported by MTV on Tuesday evening.
A swastika was drawn on the wall of the hospital and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Focus 15.9. at 16:02 Corrected incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the target building.
State shuts down Y train to Karjaa - passengers annoyed, "quite idiotic"
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raseborg Karjaa will stop running in March.
The news infuriated passengers who boarded the train in the early evening at Helsinki Central Station.
Especially the shutdown will hit the people of Siuntio, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a fast and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but a matter of political will - or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in an interview video with HSTV that he will come to the capital by tractor, for example.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main line will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula will not be used.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR announced information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services from during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be discontinued throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will be approved later by the Monetary Committee.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that a state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by people other than the Raseborgians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the city area by train.
"It's especially miserable for those who have to re-plan their journey," he said as he climbed on the Y train.
A little relief is provided.
There will probably be a new train connection to the shoreline, which will replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This leads to increased costs for HSL, i.e. in practice the municipalities in the area and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said HSL's CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the cost.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y-train, of course, the ministry much more than this.
The R line on the main line misses two stations.
Instead, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes cease from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services will decrease on the Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu routes.
More than half a million trips are made per year on the routes to be discontinued, while the total number of trips in traffic purchased by the Ministry is approximately nine million.
The new deal is expected to bring $12.3 million in annual savings to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Capital topicality book: "Marx is worth getting acquainted with"
The crises of the world economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, who is known as the former chairman of the Communist Party, in the book The topicality of Marx's Capital published today.
"He is taken more seriously now than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalization, and encroachment of capitalist economy on an increasing scale on all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
Based on the Capital seminars organized by Hakanen, the author list also includes Aalto University professor, respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
However, the former Managing Director of the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy and the Delegation of the Finnish Economy is not a Marxist, is he?
Oh, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a current economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The usual perception is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that were too far-reaching from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Again, Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth, are being discussed.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technological revolution," Korkman analyses.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx is of no help.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just be stopped.
Yet, in Korkman's view, it is worth studying Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx couldn't be read," Korkman says.
"The Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more hated each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past.
"Every social scientist should become familiar with Marx's mindset - as with other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be sentenced in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the creation of a special tribunal to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the AFP news agency reports.
The United Nations report on the civil war in 1983-2009 came out on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers for the war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
The exact number of victims is not known.
In particular, the major offensive by the armed forces in the final months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan Armed Forces of torture, abduction and systematic sexual violence, with victims as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters.
Both sides, according to the report, have committed murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it plans to organize the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow a UN tribunal to be set up because of foreign judges.
English yo-exam allowed to weigh in on social media
On Wednesday, the autumn matriculation exams were conducted in a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 trainees tested their English skills.
In the experiment, you could write a subject from social media, for example.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a 150-250-word article in English could be addressed to the online magazine's advice column keeper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is the equivalent of the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He was to be asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the subject, of which one had to be chosen.
"It was the most difficult of them," assessed Mia Lybeck, the English lecturer at Porvoo Swedish-speaking upper secondary school.
The third item was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth one, according to Lybeck, was quite nice.
It had to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing speech writing," Lybeck says and evaluates the entire experiment as "quite normal."
In Finnish - or Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that covered, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large masses of data.
Some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn writings continue on Friday, when it is time for another Finnish test, i.e. the Swedish or Finnish test.
In high schools, the test is organised normally, meaning that the employees' demonstration does not affect it.
The Matriculation Examination Board urges the candidates to find suitable transport connections in time to make it to the test.
You can also get extra time if you can prove that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
A shop in Oulu was robbed at gunpoint
A shop in the Clock district was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothing and a commando hat covering his face.
The man is of normal body and about 30 years old.
According to police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and caught a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police prepare for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support patrols from elsewhere in Finland
A protest against the government's cuts will block Helsinki city centre on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary information, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
Members of SAK, Akava and STTK unions meet at Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be taking part in the demonstration.
On the other hand, the task of the police officers at work is not only to carry out the alarm duties and other police activities, but also to secure the smooth running of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the Railway Square will be closed to motor vehicles between approximately 9.30 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, starting from Mannerheimintie in the direction of the west.
Are there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
For now, at least, it seems like enough is enough.
I don't take sides on police industrial action.
According to Kujala, support patrols from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The exact patrol numbers are not given by the police.
"Some things are coming, but as a rule, we can manage on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging people to avoid using private cars in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from morning until early evening.
With the arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of charter buses coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed in the Railway Square.
In principle, the buses are quite far away.
The rest of the way must then be walked to the protest site," Kujala says.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The question of the fluidity of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now partly handled by itself.
The organizers of the protest have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to proceed peacefully.
After all, the people are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held across Finland on Friday.
The demonstration on Friday is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is not a very good reference point for it in Finnish political history, says Emeritus Martti Siiriäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, says Soiäinen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core points of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tough stance is lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the trade union movement is really trying to bring to its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the trade union movement certainly does not have the support of all wage earners for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration brings about in the crowd that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a point of reference for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostorstai, organized in 1993, says Soiäinen.
Organised in the midst of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Aho's (center) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earner organisations had never been as bad as during Aho's bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than it was at the time of the Burglary Thursday.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, says Soiäinen.
The current coalition government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time of the boom, there were still certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The protest will also stop public transport and potentially close day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive undivided support from employees, it may become the largest in years.
Around 300 demonstrations have taken place in Helsinki each year in recent years.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, are law-abiding.
Protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, Soiäinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also striking strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s Metal and Electric Strikes
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electric strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men took part in the strike.
The strike was suspended by a motion of the settlement board after the strike lasted seven weeks.
The metal men got a 16% pay rise.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Breakthrough Thursday in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many made unemployed by the recession, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The strike by firefighters was one of the longest, if not the longest, nationwide strike of the 1990s.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police officers were caught in egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU quits," was one of the slogans.
The farmers at Espa dumped tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also caused farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike was in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and mass dismissals of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass secession eventually accelerated the negotiations.
Doctors on strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike - forced," was the slogan of the striking doctors in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and sparked a lively debate about how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation investigates background of Finnish truck full of refugees for Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in determining the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police in Aisterheim, near the German border, stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those who were in the refrigerated truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Superintendent Tero Haapala of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees in Austria who had travelled by truck were more fatal.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by asphyxiation.
According to Yleisradio, who first told about the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria for human trafficking.
A refugee-beating captain, a former drug mule, and a wealthy businessman - the story of five smugglers
A loaded king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
Such people, for example, are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and Giampaolo Musumeci, a journalist, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book, Death's Travel Agency, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, come up with solutions, and introduce smugglers from different levels of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat the hell out of them right now.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer holidays.
Due to their location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
By comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-smoking captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more lucrative for a fisherman to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
For one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for clients for him all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until it flared up again with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is provided in such a way that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if a customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
At midnight, we go out in the water with extinguished lanterns.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo is unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for the return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his customers and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
He relates in the book that when the police once spotted him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one by the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful travelers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he has his compatriots to beat this one up for this.
I'll beat the hell out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it's seen its best days anyway.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where mainly families are allowed to enter.
In the forests around the city centre, men who travel without their families are housed in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which now anyone has managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but that's a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walks in rough terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
Arriving in the Bogovaða area, a major hub for human smuggling, people are exhausted to death.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to haggle.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly goofy goofy all the way.
First you agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he will work cheaper than others and will charge only 50 euros per person for the ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about three hundred kilometers, most comfortably on the highway.
Colleagues are reportedly asking for a triple or quadruple price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis are not allowed to transport migrants closer than 12 kilometres to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his rides a mile from the border.
He then points his customers in the right direction and dashes away.
In the Work of Mercy
The 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, which is frequented by many believers who have fled the Congo, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business in which people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear looks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and onwards to Europe.
The client will initially call one of the Missionary's five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide your money wisely and soar among the peddlers who cross the border.
In order to gain asylum seeker or refugee status, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones in North Kivu, for example, and that they have been forced to flee their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary organizes a new identity for the client.
The old ID will be destroyed and a replacement will be acquired.
It is aided by missionary contacts with the Ugandan police.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows the bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and the migration process, for example, to a European country costs 4 500-7,000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a fledgling smuggler, a former drug mule.
The 40-year-old Irishman is on call off the coast of France in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks en route to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan living in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truckers who may not even know they are in the human-smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 freeway, trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
A taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the freeway to a rest stop, where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - he has to make sure that it's on its way to England and not Holland, for example - and cuts across the safety wire of the tarpaulin.
It has to be done quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but that's when it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, similar to the one they wrap around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should keep the police thermal scanner from spotting the hider.
Some people use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the scene in the hope that the driver will not snag stowaways, at least until Britain does.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
Upporika Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, who dominates sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and is constantly developing new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money when he arrives.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: from Turkish ports, yachts are rented to supposedly take American or European families on nice tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are loaded with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported for a fee of EUR 5 000 to EUR 7 000, first from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are crammed into minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it is necessary to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way below deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of the crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately 53,000 euros for one luxury vessel trip after the costs.
He doesn't do the practical things himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred homes through shell companies that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a member of parliament of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Correction 16 September 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute
Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book, which competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published snippets of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He entered the games in top condition and ran in the qualifiers for the second best time.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right at the start and defended his lead with a manic run.
However, 150 metres before the finish, his strength ran out.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other contestants passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line," Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of making money from having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her action.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he longed for adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life was revealed in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world's number one in the 1500 metres with a time of 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
The World Champion rejoiced when the union put the Norwegian ski rooster in check: "straight-backed"
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the line of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Like last year, Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wresting all summer and autumn from the athlete agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion either.
As a result of the agreement dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northugi from the World Cup for the coming season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster in check.
"Thank you for showing the backbone," Jacobsen wrote on her Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season's national team so that he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also look after future generations, and not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and non-financial privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been a part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug released his own statement, in which he asserted that he would like to play sports in Norwegian colours in the World Cup next season as well as in the World Cup and the Olympic Games thereafter.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two gold ones.
He was part of the team that won relay gold in Falun last winter.
Roast translators' shield day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D. Day 25 September, various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the S.H.I.E.L.E.L.D. badge will host the events.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the sign as part of high quality.
At the same time, we want to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but top restaurants that have been inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of raising awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis in Vaasa.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organisation's most significant international events, taking place on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will remain the host country for the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre has been appealed to the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the Kauhava ex-army currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, critical infrastructure for the crisis period is still permanently located in the area, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
According to Kauhajoki magazine, the placement of a reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been investigated in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that for the past two years, there have been negotiations on the organisation of flight training for Kauhava Airport and the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Ministry of Defence Permanent Secretary Arto Rädy, among others.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing the reception centre in principle, but about the planned location in the former garrison area being wrong.
The City Council of Kauhava discussed the reception centre matter last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö commented to reporters in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the president, concern over the management of the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the ultimate issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we have great challenges ahead of us
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
It is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further on the tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the issue of NATO was also touched on in discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closes for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 on Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia is told that the aim is to manage the operations of the airports with the help of superiors during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected at security checkpoints and other service points.
Demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars from around 9:30am to 2pm.
No cars are allowed from the direction of Mannerheimintie to Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu towards the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers in full Friday demonstration
Metro and tram drivers take part in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Tram and Metro staff association told STT about it last night.
Most starters close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday's protest will also cause disruption to Posti's services.
There are significant delays in the delivery of e.g. day mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross blood transports are handled despite the strike.
Efforts are also being made to treat meal deliveries, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Situational information on the services is available on Posti's website.
Most of Finland's Alkos will close its doors for two hours on Friday.
The service trade union Pam has instructed its employees to stop work between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged grocery trade workers to take part in a protest by trade unions.
Representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open with a supervisor if necessary.
According to Kesko, it is not yet known whether individual stores could be closed.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
Day care centres in Helsinki will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to protests by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in day care centres and playgrounds will not be organised.
24-hour day care centers and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to announce further changes tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, there is a need for diverse channels for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become a recurring habit.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let's see.
We're going to use this channel tonight," Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio talk to citizens.
This set of issues that we are talking about is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at Yle Arena.
SIPILÄ takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's televised speech will not tell of a more general introspection of the government.
Is the aim to take the right to define the public debate more strictly into one's own hands and to refuse the question formulations of the public debate? ponders Professor Anu Koivunen of Stockholm University.
Reminds me of Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow himself to be defined by it.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are unrelated.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not announcements in a democracy.
By definition, it is the job of the media representatives to try to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken as given.
According to Koivunen, television talk is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more available today than we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way, or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a special situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a danger that Yle will be branded as a communicator of politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or the general policy.
Sneaky bet from Sipilä
In Sipilä's forthcoming speech, it is also important what the Prime Minister does not say, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should look carefully at what Sipilä is missing and what he is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
Kuutti says that the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, because this way he can bring out his own point of view without any gravel sounds.
This will get the message across to the general public without a journalistic filter, as opposed to a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipila bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret something about the speech because no more specific questions can be asked.
Kuutt says it's very important how Sipilä performs on TV - whether he's sweating, whether his hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila can present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than it would be if the government were to inform on something, because here the person is talking directly to the other person.
This is what (US President Barack) Obama and his associates do regularly.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
It has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means, Railo says.
The researcher thinks that the Prime Minister thus wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails that lie ahead.
Workers' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes on Friday against the government's actions.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chairperson of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he is challenging Sipilä to dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
THE BOY IS FOUND AND FINE, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Inner Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play around four in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was not contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disillusioned by violent fad among young people: You create hate
Kurdish-based fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted the video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a heavy speech against street fighting by young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and came to Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series of mixed martial arts.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
Videos of young people fighting with extreme violence have been uploaded to the account.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed by the fad of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick the ones on the ground, sit on the top of the other one, and punch blindly without thinking about any of these consequences of what happens when you make videos like this.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people shown in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and native Finnish youth.
Especially the fact that you fight in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Amirkhani from Turku reminds.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are websites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have come in quite outrageous numbers.
A little difficult, boys, just to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be quite a long time guests here.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the victim of someone's racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you get involved in something like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You make me hate you, which I don't like either.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you're not going to improve them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its position on austerity package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Chairman of SAK Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the staff central organisation STTK said it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five per cent productivity leap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
SAK chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter sparingly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that agreements made by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not good enough for SAK.
Sipilä previously broke off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the goal of a five-percent productivity leap.
Comment: Major protest threatens to slump - "It feels a little funny to be thrashing your fist"
After all, it feels a little funny to thrash your fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospheres vary from one employee camp to the next.
Is the intention to shout the government down, or is it to agree with it after all?
On Monday, SAK's union leaders burst into holy anger at the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with closure.
The threat spread to the Akavas as well.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened the closure of schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or kindergarten will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), chairman of the STTK staff centre organisation, appeared conciliatory.
He said that he kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) as a five-percent productivity leap.
Akava's chairman, Sture Fjäder (kok), hastened to announce that his paperwork is already ready.
At first there was no sound from the SAK office.
Chairman Lauri Lylyn (sd) finds it difficult to reconcile when the union leaders just on Monday ordered the country to stand up on Friday.
Eventually, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to deal with the situation and that SAK was looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a common proposal among wage earners, SAK should be inclined to accept a five per cent productivity leap as a goal.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has good relations with Sipilä's government.
Palola's right-hand man, Jukka Ihanus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the centrist prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
In fact, Palola characterized the government's trade union expertise as improving all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit of momentum away from the Finnish halters, whose frontman is Marko Piirainen of the ACP (sd).
It feels a little funny to have a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, the spokesman of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, the spokesman of the Russian Duma, thinks Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July solemn meeting in Helsinki.
At the time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union sanctions list to come to the meeting - an issue that the President could remind journalists of.
In our estimation, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without a hitch, so Naryshkin continued to pin Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (kok), the leader of the meeting, in Ulan Bator, who, according to Russian media, has already spoken with the Russian delegation.
The Clave Meets a Real Playoff Troll: "Paints Tight"
Tappara and Clave continue the bull days in Hakametsä today, when both are on fire for the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no actual goal celebrations in Hakametsä today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to pick up a 3-2-continuing time win over KalPa.
The rise was masculine, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
Tuesday of the lock was more minor win.
The guest of the Blues, who started their game tangled, was round zero points, and the defeat figures were also 2-3.
Tough game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lukko attacker Janne Lahti anticipates the setups on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Rauma people.
In the previous two seasons, Tappara has dropped from the final series of the Clave in the semifinals.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been claimed for the settlement.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three chests and passed.
With the exception of the goalkeepers, there are no major changes in the composition of the groups.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday get flute duty today.
With Tappara's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the lock posts Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of View: A Miserable Play in Progress
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The underdog sensationally put up a fight for heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky received great sympathy, although he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story for Pori.
The nameless and wooden-handed casserole progressed to the SM finals to everyone's astonishment in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut off the Iroquois.
Toivola became a blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
The Aces took the silver won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
Writer Toivola believes that this season's novel works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager for Aces has built a pot pile on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been beating up guys in the trough like Rocky pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are credited with something other than disc gameplay.
Toivola has forgotten that the lead role in Rocky VI is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has called Iron Rock Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is in Rocky, written by Toivola, as clumsy a lead actor as Connery would have been in the 1976 original.
There's no Rocky in Iron Rock other than the nickname.
The game philosophy of Rautakallio does not include rushing and petty pigging.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's one thing to play hard, it's another to play pig.
Last season, Aces' Garret Stafford tackled Tapparan Jere Karjalainen on the head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I don't accept that kind of game and it doesn't belong in the ace hockey," Rautakallio snarled after the game to the People of Satakunta.
The team of the Aces this season is strangely built.
There are juniors, there are veterans, there are cops, there are bullies.
There are practically no key players in the best age of play.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about the skills gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the past season have an impact on purchases and unfortunately the situation in the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smoldering beneath the surface.
The 1953 Rautakallio is reportedly interested in joining Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season is equal to the number of losses in a goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I play the mother of a friend of my husband's in the movie.
In a way it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanta's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot in the past, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, about the early years of Apulanta, is that of drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Cricket cheers and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to play.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have grown much closer.
They have met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different corners of their history.
Fortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanta would become the biggest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession, and it was really dreary.
There was a pretty small chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuuka from her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do parents really know what you were up to?
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuukka, known as Heinola's infamous skateboarder.
Olga was an everyday and good girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka in the film.
At best, he could have been secretly enamored.
According to Olga, she has worked so much with Tuukka over the past 10 years that a big joint project doesn't scare her.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot for a month in Heinola.
True, a couple who live in Iiti often also plan to drive home for the night for their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, only asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will start filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive play film ever made in Finland with a budget of €17 million.
Previously, Finland's most expensive film title has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation, which is in the making, will also go past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming of the film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, will begin in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
A huge budget doesn't scare me.
I have been sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone on the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Although time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he told Iltalehti.
Originally, the budget for the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script evolved, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story too.
However, the film could be crammed into 100 million, because every angle of view and effects is so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's no slack.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond at an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent on Wednesday.
The final rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green, and Vladimir Burlakov.
Jerk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' fronts have recently been adorned with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or T-shirt sign was seen as somewhat of a jerk.
But times change.
Sports has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to get ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. the everyday fashion, where trendsetters surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothes as if as a way to separate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic collegium, a sweatpants shirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet is put on, in front of which the manufacturer's logo is displayed.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas' recognizable track sweatpants, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback in street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos on the underpants that are starting to twinkle at the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be shifting from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace's fall blouses makes it clear what brand of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your dress?
Russian politician released proof: I didn't get stuck for hours in a tank hatch!
Allegedly, a special incident had taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held presenting products from the Russian military industry.
In recent days, Russian media have been spreading colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations was forced to remove the large Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a photo on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking through the hatch of an armored vehicle in a pretty good mood, and at least from those photos it's not about getting stuck or getting angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov, a former professional soldier himself, explained that he admired Russia's new technology at the exhibition.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next show I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside, and I came out.
I am tall and robust, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank happened," he told the radio station Russkaya sluzhba novostei.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photos of the alleged jam have been published, despite a total of 50,000 people attending the gun show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a Bloknot.ru story in which Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank hatch while trying and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the organisers of the exhibition shared their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers quickly jumping out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said the exhibition's coordinator, Aleksandr Pisarevsky, to Bloknot.
Here's a favorite of bloggers.
The 1962 candelabra by the architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) looks like it was designed today.
The cube-like steel frame is like a work of art, and it was.
The architect brothers are known to have honed the shape of the candelabra for a long time and with mathematical precision.
It was initially presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the lords.
Kubus candles are manufactured by the family business By Lassen, which upholds the design heritage of the renowned brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one candle versions, in four different colours.
Kubu is available in black, white, nickel and copper.
The candelabra is topical right now and is suitable for a wide range of homes.
It has been a favorite of interior bloggers in particular lately.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called tailings pond into the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to repair the leak.
The pool contains foaming process neutralized tailings and purified process water.
In general, water is either pumped for reuse as process water or discharged through a surface drainage field into the environment as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during an inspection round on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to cause structural damage to the dam structures in the pool.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
Finland's country report, published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed for structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed throughout the treaty system as well as unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppamäki, Chief Economist at Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
The IMF's assessment has a lot to say about the government's actions, but on the other hand, there are also words of caution about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki to Taloussanomat.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF is forecasting economic growth of 0.4% for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske expects this year's growth to be zero in its new business cycle forecast.
The IMF is a bit more optimistic about this year.
They may have been the basis for the latest findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported a small increase in total production in the summer, Kuoppamäki notes.
Less attention may have been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few percent of the decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that was brought up as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda to Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is seen as taking Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it doesn't eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country are disappearing each year.
This has been reported by SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants are disappearing in the country every year.
Juha Kannelmaa, Superintendent of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many of the applicants disappear "under country" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications for unaccompanied minors were made in Finland.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it becomes clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more tempting for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were subject to a decision of lapse due to the fact that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared during the past year, he says.
Is the number increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications from minors who came alone.
Overall statistics on missing minor asylum seekers are not yet available this year, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has clearly increased, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well.
What about those who have received a decision to convert?
Are they also disappearing into the "dark labour market", for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the decisions on proselytism, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants to the country.
He has taken action on the matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the meeting of EU interior ministers, announced practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see photos of the equipment
The equipment used for TV and radio productions by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells devices at Huuto.net, which were once among the most advanced professional tools in their field.
The online advertisement was first reported by the online magazine Iltamakasini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological advances.
In the digital media world, no more television programs are filmed on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be people interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these are also needed as long as there is such old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders for IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move out of his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what items are being discarded.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
After recent strokes, it is clear that a man who has had a long career will not return to working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are now being sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to break down worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to extend the force action in connection with Friday's protest.
The original plan was to halt metro and tram traffic only for a demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it is decided whether traffic will stop for the whole day.
Chief shop steward Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is big on the field.
The cuts in night and shift supplements are hurting drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the extras are met with opposition.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area is virtually at a standstill.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no commuter or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the designated stations.
According to HSL data, most of the buses remain in the depot.
ACP members are absent from work from 3 a.m. on Friday to 3 a.m. on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by a supervisor, HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo reckons.
Repo says HSL will not be able to say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
Employers' organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Square on Friday at 11-13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move on to Europe, the AP news agency reports.
According to Sky News, the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at Texas school after teacher thought self-made watch was bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought the self-made clock he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to showcase the output of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the watch looked just like a bomb.
Police were called to the scene, and the situation finally ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, police had stated that the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is outraged by the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether the incident is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain roars - Labour leader refuses to sing national anthem
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
Criticism from the right-wing press has also been echoed by MPs from Corbyn's own Labour party.
This has offended the public," Labour MP Kate Green said in a BBC radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's commemoration commemorated the battle of British Air Force pilots against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he paid tribute to the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the Labour ranks.
Especially among MPs are those who fear he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn advocates unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is scheduled to appear in Parliament for the first time today as party leader during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted last week about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families," the prime minister tweeted in his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder remains unclear - the father of the family was awaiting a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concerns at the school about the children's absence.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for an inspection and found Short's family dead in various parts of the huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and a Successful Company
The case of South Lake Minnetonka police chief Michael Siitari is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune on a social media site for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short reported that the site has four million different visitors each week.
I have received 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, in the fact that the Short family bought a lofty house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised on the real estate site Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
He had been sued by Achieve Test Prep, a provider of various prep courses, for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short's site, and thus they had lost customers to their competitors.
According to StarTribune, however, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri served cake coffee
In addition, the owner trio were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great, Loiri commented cheerfully on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the major competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loiri, Korpi, the trainer of the success horse, gets full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri ruffled.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The greatest athlete's donation of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million euros) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
Subban, 26, is also committed to helping the hospital with other fundraisers for the next seven years.
Subban signed an eight-year, $72 million contract with the Canadiens a year ago.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadian players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among other things, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another major hospital in the city to provide the hospital with the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order a wife at the Japanese cafe for the evening - serve the food with just a bikini and an apron on
Theme cafes are a big deal in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hali café and now a wife café.
It strikes the lonely, the company sick, and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
At the Ore no Yome cafe in Tokyo, you can order yourself a wife or husband for the evening.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "spouse" is chosen from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves the food.
The wife is faced with nothing but apron and bikinis, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the wife candidates regarding their height and weight, always to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon, 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: Attacks against car security began to be equipped
In addition, the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a press release published by Intel.
The Board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections with the aim of standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will update the report in the future based on ASRB's research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and sharing web-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars," said Chris Young, president of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish safety best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS model has been expected for years like the moon rising.
At last, the car is also beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford announced the RS data now that the eyes of the automotive world are on the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-wheel-drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from 0 to 100 with a top speed of 266 km/h thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine.
Also interesting for Finns is the price, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, although when the first cars will arrive in Finland, Ford says in a statement.
Favorite brand Kia introduced two novelties at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
Of the two novelties in Finland, the new fourth-generation Sportage is certainly more important, with which Kia intends to capture a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created in the form of a new European design director, Gregory Guillaume, Sportage is rounder than before.
A centimeter has come to the wheelbase and outside dimensions here and there, and the car splits the air more efficiently than before.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo, which develops 177 horsepower.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are told closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat reached our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels, and higher-end equipment.
To begin with, Optimos with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine will be available.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as the Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
Around the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima station wagon begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - banged in a bold jumpsuit
Singer Chisu is part of the Life for a Child concert with other Finnish stars.
The electric blue pantsuit has a showy, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully presents the graceful waist of the singer star.
The ensemble is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
The singer, who became a mother during the three-year hiatus, has been able to shed the pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and in front of the general public after a long break doesn't really excite me.
I miss all the music related stuff, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will release their new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's Maternity Style Astonishes Again, Now Shows Chest
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after the other.
She shows off her pregnancy belly and chest braces generously in sexy clothes, the last time last night at one o'clock American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left a gig with husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the breast.
As the flash lights flash, it reveals the skin-colored bras under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity outfit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-knee boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week's Friday, when there was a pregnancy belly on the show.
The hard laws of the modeling world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the notion that the modeling world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Talking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their minds about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled the six hard truths of Leloup from behind the scenes.
Each season starts from scratch.
Even if you had posed in top designer outfits in the previous season, the new season starts with castings again.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry competing for jobs with veterans.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuous travel and can take up to a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can't travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York might ask you to drop some pounds, but in Paris, they'll say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks end, the difference is sore.
Models want this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but what gnaws at them is that everyone thinks the job is just showing off clothes.
Models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But in the work of the model can also express itself.
Models at the Tory Burch show yesterday.
New York is currently celebrating Fashion Week, where designers will unveil their collection for next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
In the film based on the early years of Apulanta, Roope Salminen plays the band's founding member Antti Lautala.
Lautala founded Apulanta in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I am soon to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I play a 16-year-old guitarist.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unfamiliar to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to impersonate a human being.
The man who runs the band Scrooge Salminen and Dogs will not leave the role.
Punk mannerisms come naturally to a man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, I'm sure many saw a foretaste, as well if you've ever been to one of our shows.
Our performance has never been anything small-minded, but we always go full-on.
The main cast of the 1993-2004 film Teit us beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta, was announced today.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is played by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a hint of his upcoming job as early as last night, when he told Snapchat he was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture on Instagram of his new look, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, previously seen on his mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face smooth, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force it, says Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Smaller children should be protected, not, for example, allowed to watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can linger in the mind and be distressed, she says.
However, if a child has come across television news images of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing up.
It is a good idea to discuss the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
It is not a good idea to frighten a child unnecessarily, even if you are distressing and frightening yourself.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to bring up the issue with them if the child is wondering about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can think about how this will be handled in our family.
After all, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety when possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child will have a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Your own strength at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Ball lightning hitting Vermo hard to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to hone Apila's Pallolasama into a fierce blow in midsummer.
It only ran for wins and second place until at the end of July, the Tampere races experienced a collapse.
Since the stallion was thoroughly frozen, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered an appointment with his protégé from the vet.
An explanation for the blackout was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two courses of medicine to defeat it.
As Clover's ball lightning had to be light exercise, Pohjola says that he was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku in its record time after Taruntuuli.
The clover ball flash was very under pressure from the break, as it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, a slight deflection at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
The coach assumes that a good race made the stallions sharp.
The horse's tone certainly went from there, and hopefully it would have leveled off as well.
Clover's ball lightning has been so-called humor horses.
When it's not amused, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has had such a lightning strike that the opponents have been amazed.
At short speed, the competitors are no match for the ball lightning, which even gives off warm-blooded rides.
In the North's wishes there is a nest run in Vermo.
However, the different thing is how Clover's Ball Lightning agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure and you might even go under the boom of the starting car and stuff like that.
Hopefully, the stallion will be calmer than it was when we left.
While in shape, Clover's ball lightning can also come from the bow, and we will start driving it for the win, the coach promises.
This Is Why You Can't Get Rid of Unnecessary iPhone Programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple iPhones may be able to be uninstalled sometime in the future - but not quite all of them.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own programs from iPhones in the future, CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone has a number of apps that relatively few people use: For example, FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other apps.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation eased to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, or 0.1 per cent year-on-year, Eurostat, the EU's statistical authority, reported today.
The price increase was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its estimate of 0.2% a couple of weeks ago slightly downwards.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's forecast for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Last month, energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper than a year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, the average inflation rate was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Among the euro area countries, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent as prices fell.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus sign according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Euro area inflation is still persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of a price increase of around 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed next to try to tighten monetary policy
The U.S.'s next recession will start at its fastest in less than a year, but more surely within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, starts raising interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline in turn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession could hit at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market price shock before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they used to - and if they react to the Fed's extortion of the money taps the way they used to.
Such conclusions have been reached by German bank Deutsche Bank's London Market Research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a more than 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its major international customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or a different model than at the time of previous interest rate hikes - and what the consequences might be.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not even be a year
The leaders, who decide on the Fed's monetary policy and its respective tuning, have been hinting all through the summer and early autumn that the time is ripe for interest rates to be raised.
The first interest rate hike in more than nine years may occur as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds policy rate was in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rate increases of 0.25 percentage points, from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended exactly two years ago.
The symptoms of financial markets began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis tore into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, severe adversity in the financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically occurred since previous Fed rate hikes.
Similarly, the trials were then tougher and more severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have been sifting through the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and financial market reversals since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
They report on the Fed's interest rate increases and their economic and financial impact since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the first rate hike has been less than a year, most often less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of the Fed's rate hikes.
The Fed has successively raised and lowered its key interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen cycles of varying lengths.
Each time has deviated in some respects from the others, and the multiplier is relatively sparse in the review, so it is unlikely to make any definite conclusions about the effects of the next rate hikes.
As the strategy points out, this time a lot is different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be undisputedly discovered even by decades of research.
But three things about the causes that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are somewhat undisputedly clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long.
They patched up the traces of the techno bubble, while growing the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated over the decades in different parts of the financial and real economy, and already too high, became even larger as a result of the excessive monetary policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt bubble in economic history to date.
3) In most areas of financial markets, the crazily cheap debt financing, which was almost contained in the financial economy in particular, inflated the largest price bubbles in economic history to date, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Even so, there is hardly much dispute that the financial markets, which had risen to ever more complex levels of leverage, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile state when the Fed and other central banks last pushed up interest rates.
Financial structures based on debt levers, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted no longer than their time after interest rate hikes had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned up.
The risks materialized as a financial crisis followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give an idea by mentioning things such as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time, debt has not been as cheap as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt load of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now, in different parts of the economy, there is a heavier debt load than before the financial crisis or half of it ever before.
3) Liquidity from central banks, which has become more frequent and cheaper, has mostly remained in the financial markets and has pushed key asset and security classes to their most expensive levels since the peak before the financial crisis or ever.
Not only do strategists lax the mood with warning signs from the financial markets, but they also point out that not even the U.S. economy has yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the pattern it has seen in the past.
The Eurozone economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but correspondingly, the pressures and risks in the financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next begins to tighten its money taps more tightly.
Perhaps the future image of Albert Edwards, a strategist at the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
He has for some time coached the bank's international investor clients in the following turnarounds of the Fed:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush out the financial fires with even bigger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are targeted at HP's corporate services, the company says.
HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will focus on corporate sales, and HP Inc., which will focus on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, the staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company recognises non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) on the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
Consumer-side reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers are responsible for more than 10% of its operating profit.
Just the other year, its three most significant customers accounted for 65% of operating profit.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the Board of Directors of a tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is about the Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice for membership in May this year.
I checked and it's enough that I've filed a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company is used to manage the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, following the merger, on the Board of Directors of Kährs and a Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings go through a multi-tiered ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted board membership in a Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second-largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to see to it that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the income from the capital of our Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg-based holding company ready for the holdings.
A reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers opens in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 residents starting at 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase to a maximum of 300-400 people within a week.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre at the former Rescue College property.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK prepares alternative working life blackmail package
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package to the government's tightening of working life.
The organisation also hopes to involve other employee centre organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of lowering the price of labour will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola remarked during a break in the organization's administration meeting to reporters.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK), on the other hand, is not prepared for discussions.
Economists at STTK have calculated that the change security included in the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package will cost the employer EUR 2,700 million.
I don't know if there's a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if you're on the side of one to a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing the reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable is realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, cutting Sunday supplements is a painful place for the staff central organisation STTK.
The organization requires the government to back down from the coercive legislation with which it would be implementing some of the extortion.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the fact that an alternative package would be prepared with the SDP, which had the issue on the table.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75%, and holidays will be reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have invited wage earners to the demonstration, and the intention has not been to organise a strike.
Akava's Fjäder thanks
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder commends STTK's announcement of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK will now align with Akava, as Akava has long been outlining an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava's chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join him in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier on Wednesday that they were preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a five percent competitive jump by the country's government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Sture Fjäder, chairman.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that works for the government and employers in the country," Fjäder says.
Akava's Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, volunteers" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
University of Tampere Green Left Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar previous speech by the Prime Minister, one must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave the famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operators' strike with a televised speech.
Monologue, monarchist vibes
All day long, Sipilä's speech has attracted criticism and speculation about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, the chair of the Left Alliance, stated on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as an announcement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed".
According to the Greens, "there has already been a monologue.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist sentiment: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, challenged Sipilä to a dialogue: "Soon six months after the elections.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for presenting the Sipilä speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, says Ismo Silvo, Director of Yle Publications at Yle News.
Like us in the time of the oaks
The speech has also sparked ridicule.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
Mom puts on a prettier kolt and Dad puts a tie around his neck.
At nine o'clock, we'll be quiet in front of the TV like we used to be in the days of the Oaks," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Will Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who are drafting amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time telling the people that they must cut back when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It has published the accompanying bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, living on debt, and team spirit in the evening?
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western nations rejected Russia's proposal to oust Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to persuade Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abdicate, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan by which al-Assad would have stepped down from power in style after some time.
However, Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Assad would fall anyway in a few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points of the plan for him in the bilateral discussion: no weapons were allowed to be used against the opposition, there had to be an immediate voice contact between the opposition and Assad, and Assad's abdication had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all issues, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell you what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
The diplomats did not comment.
Ahtisaari says he relayed Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are not two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused any deal that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, the former head of the Middle East section of the British Foreign Office, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's remarks because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke under the authority of Moscow.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have responded that I want to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power with some supporter of Assad.
The flow of refugees is our own doing
During the negotiations Ahtisaari had killed about 7,500 people in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The influx of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no other choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
Centre for Asylum Seekers in Tornio
The Asylum Seekers' Settlement Centre, planned by the Government in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty building of the Tornio shared lyceum in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-chairman of Tornio City Council, this is not true.
When the whole council was not in session and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to call a council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specifies to STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the debate.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on that, you could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and reacted quickly.
The joint lyceum would accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple of hundred meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipila still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre), the halving of holiday money in public would only take care of part of the reduction in the price of labour sought by the government.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations manage to agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for substitutes for the work-related extortion announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will of course gladly accept it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's opinion, halving the holiday pay would be a way of working, because it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday bonuses.
Labour market organisations could mutually agree on a cut in holiday bonuses, as these are recorded in collective agreements instead of legislation.
With this in mind, the Government will report to Parliament on working life blackmails on Wednesday next week in the form of a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
The legislative work then starts, meaning that the train is moving and it is getting more and more difficult.
There's plenty of time now.
It won't be long, if there is a will to do so.
The list released by the government last week includes the conversion of Epiphany and Ascension Day into unpaid holidays without reducing the annual working hours.
In addition, pay for the first days of illness will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be reduced to 75%, and holidays will be reduced.
The reforms are implemented as coercive legislation past the trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Due to the actions, the trade union organisations are holding a large-scale demonstration on Friday, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi council approved the expansion of the mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but somewhat murmuringly approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, i.e. the storage facility of the sap hall.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than was originally discussed.
Busy schedule as well.
It was also a bit of a surprise that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment program, but the money will be decided later on in the interim report.
There was still talk of an investment of between €150,000 and €200,000 on the agenda, but at the meeting, Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at €300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Board eased its previous sharp stance on bringing street name signs in Karelian to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of fostering Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street name signs in Karelian language in the city centre.
However, on a case-by-case basis, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language in, for example, information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same approach to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, the use of the Karelian language is also worth being open-minded about now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia as well.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of these can be used for a variety of marketing purposes in the province.
Termination of train connections cuts the province's vitality
Cuts in train connections hit the province's vitality hard.
Transport connections have a direct impact on the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether people can live and work here at all, Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been discussed several times.
It is important for the province as a whole that our chances of survival are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the effects of these shutdowns on employment, for example, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Rector Jukka Mönkkönen of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor accessibility also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult, because the connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel voices for Siu's war
The Joensuu City Board's view of the provincial Siun sote project is seemingly unanimous, but there is also one gravel sound among them.
City Board member Pentti Keskisalo (sd., in the photo) proposed to abandon the whole project at the board meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed as unprofitable.
The Government approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although one train pair will be fewer.
There will be changes to passenger train services between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train inning is missed, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money for rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four-year period will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely closed.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys snuck off.
The rescue services released a 12-year-old who had climbed up the roof and was unable to get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Torniomäki on Ketotie at half past six on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof at all.
That did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others snuck out of the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to the scene to help with a draft ladder to safely return the last one left on the roof to the ground.
Fluctuations in FedEx net sales, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak performance for the latest quarter, with the transportation industry leaving its full-year profit forecast weakened due to reduced demand for freight services and increased costs for ground transportation.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's share fell by about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the actual trading opened on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is between $10.40 and $1.90 for the fiscal year ending in May, a decline of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a factset study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened despite price increases of an average of 4.9%. The increases will take effect on January 4. Additional charges for land transport of heavy or large shipments will take effect in November.
The company still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenue and e-commerce growth.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith noted that the company has performed well in a weaker-than-expected economic climate, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans for hiring seasonal workers were announced a day after rival UPS announced plans to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90,000 and 95,000 people.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx had an operating profit of $692 million, a six percent increase.
Earnings per share were $2.42, leaving the $2.44 forecast for the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Revenues rose five percent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, revenue was expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class shipments in recent years, causing the company's Express unit to stagnate.
The strong growth of e-commerce has confirmed the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit reflected the increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit generated better returns due to higher base charges, while the freight business's returns declined due to higher labor costs.
About an hour before the actual opening of trading, the stock price of FedEx had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock ended up falling 11 percent from the year-end average and 17 percent below the highest quotation recorded on June 11.
This week, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve Fed are meeting at the most anticipated meeting in years. The crowd sits down at a eight-foot-diameter Honduran wooden table to decide if it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's ornate, two-story meeting room is a mural depicting the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, president of the Central Bank, and her colleagues must put the financial interest of the state above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank's leadership has noted a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be the missing piece in terms of a thorny decision. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to begin weaning from an unforeseen stimulus provided by short-term interest rates that stayed close to zero until late 2008.
While most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in the financial markets can cause officials at an already cautious central bank to flinch at the increase in volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate — even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labor market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical follow-up," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market will give enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who have considered the matter do not agree on what the central bank is going to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of economists in a study conducted by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, it is expected that the central bank will wait, and according to the main indicator, there is only a 30% chance of withdrawal.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices may fall unless policymakers soften the blow by promising a second raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
"The surge was driven by expectations that the central bank will keep the key interest rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this point," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets without shaking."
In turn, the experts of the second said that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank appeared to be leaning towards raising interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, a first small step in tightening the financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has stated throughout the spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to be raised this year — despite the Liberals saying that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wages appear to be picking up
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2% targets, central bank decision-makers stated that a key reason for this was the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can do well with higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as they take into account the tight labour market situation," said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson.
However, financial markets around the world did not startle last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by as much as 16 percentage points from the record high in May and investors feared China's economic decline would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now dropped nearly 10 percent from its May peak.
The turmoil in the market means that the decision-makers of the central bank will become even more complicated to consider raising the key interest rate.
"The work of the Central Bank is becoming more complicated, despite what has happened in the financial markets and despite the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official, said.
Now he believes the central bank will wait at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the U.S. economy. There is little reliable data on the situation since the recent development of the Chinese economy," said Oliner.
Restoring the world economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential player in the world's monetary economy.
The Central Bank has had a huge impact in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanken that the Central Bank could narrow the scope of its operations sparked upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined; in addition to monitoring trends in the world, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overview of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of a central bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, director of global strategy at asset management company Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond Regional Central Bank said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee with the right to vote, has called for an increase in the policy rate, citing as an example the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"As a result of the Asian economic crisis, the central bank decided in three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, even though there were only limited identifiable sanctions available for economic growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank reversed the decision.
"The central bank should only put monetary stability first in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic crash," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's Interest Committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't even come close to the situation at the time," he said.
"There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates due to market shocks," added Posen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Until this changes, I do not think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazilian Rio Grande Pediatric Association Promotes a Proper Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian Association of Pediatrics (SPRS) in Rio Grande has developed a blinding way of teaching nursing women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-fed with pictures of unhealthy food painted on them.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates. This gives the baby all the nutrition it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to excess energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
According to a new study, in addition to increasing calorie intake, other changes in diet should be made.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a healthy diet for a pregnant woman can affect the baby's genes and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise has the most viewers, though Nine is trying to catch the lead on her Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to do a morning show on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership election, which, however, did little to improve Today's ratings.
Nine Channel's morning show was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The morning programme of the competing channel, piloted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London, with weekly special broadcasts also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance seemed to be of no importance to Australian television viewers, with Sunrise viewing an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, and Today viewing 339,000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly from last Monday's (317,000) and Tuesday's (283,000), but missed last Thursday's reading (343,000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 viewers, while Sunrise had an average of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The changes in winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

A notable novelty for Seven was the 800 Words series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached a whopping 1,219,000 viewers.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson would be enough to star in the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly yes.
Seven's The X Factor held a strong position with 1,136 000 viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families series (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
The first half hour of the new series of quizzes hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00-17.30) was followed by an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half-hour (17.30 to 18.00), the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 viewers in the first half, with the second half garnering a whopping 720,000 viewers.
Hot Seat had 620,000 viewers.
The Chase Australia's second-night ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will pass at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio thinks Sam Wood really is the Bachelor of Dreams — but who does he choose?
Was a secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of the dream bachelor, Sam Wood, has been a closely guarded secret.
The three remaining women do not breathe a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows about their moods before dropping one out of the trio.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finale.
All three women boasted that Wood was a perfect man, praised his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity, and considered him to be a suitable partner for himself.
When women were asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood if the last rose did not hit their own spot, their answers can give an indication of who will take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Things have been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"As soon as I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam are well-fitting together. This feeling has persisted throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground, and she's a really fun companion," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay said he realized on last week's hometown date that Wood might be the one.
"When I saw him in the company of my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he did not choose her, she mysteriously replied:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls just as much, Snezana and Lana are evenly matched."

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after he moved to the United States, and several other clubs also became interested in him after last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the spot.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as was the case with the Australian rugby team. Hayne fumbled the kickback situation after the team took the win Tuesday from Minnesota, 20 to 30.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the plane kick. The coach kept Hayne at the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the locker room after the game.
He didn't bludgeon the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers special editor Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles the catch, a game played against the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
Hayne and his Australian fan base had been expecting something else from his NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field profaning and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the mistake to her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when her pitching in her own area opened a place for Queensland.
Overall, the experience was incredible for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram posing together with fans and the Australian flag.

Four killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, an official source said on Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a crowd during a protest against the country's alleged new constitution. Among the victims was a four-year-old boy.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital, Kathmandu.
District chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal reported that police used tear gas and fired into the air before rubber bullets were fired.
He said 20 policemen and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which yes can kill but are generally considered to be a less destructive option, suddenly were so lethal.
This was the most recent clash in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where the Madhesi tribe said the new provinces based on the new constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protesters have also been seen in western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe calls for their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have died in violent skirmishes since August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, this is a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after thousands of people were killed in the devastating earthquake in April.
Lawmakers have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new charter could be approved by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% probability of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
There is a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone developing in the next 48 hours from a large area of low pressure about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands, the National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Department of Meteorology, there is also a clear center of low pressure located halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles, which can also develop into a tropical cyclone in the next two days with a 60% probability.
Google to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations to help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced the donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leading, the campaign was launched by Rita Masoud, a Google employee, telling of her own experiences. She was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe escalates, many families in a similar situation are in dire need of help.
Donations are made to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children ry and the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Once donations have been collected through google.com/refugeerelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate a similar amount, bringing the total to $11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst since World War II, especially exacerbated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving unresected treatment.
"It takes time to get mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who discussed the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes. However, most studies have involved morbidly overweight individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The body mass index indicates the ratio of weight and height, where the normal value is 18.5 to 14.9.
When the body mass index is above 25, the person is overweight, and the body mass index above 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own BMI at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the average body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The BMI of those who received surgery-free treatment remained close to 29.
Those undergoing surgery had a complete improvement in their diabetes by 36% and in part by 28%.
In the treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partially by only about 2%.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgically treated group.
The researchers also monitored the patients' hemoglobin-A1c levels, which describes the development of blood sugar levels.
According to the researchers, the recommended level of hemoglobin-A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, the hemoglobin-A1c level dropped from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the group receiving drug treatment, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
Hemoglobin-A1c indicates control of blood sugar levels. However, a research team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over a five-year period.
The research team also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year, the gastric bypass surgery group had higher weight loss compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the BMI reduction was greater (7.4 and 5.1), as were the hemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent respectively).
The new study failed to show a lower mortality rate after five years. However, according to a Swedish study by Blackstone at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, surgery brings life years to obese individuals.
In a Swedish study of obese people who underwent gastric bypass surgery, the probability of mortality over 15 years was reduced by 29% compared to the group receiving traditional treatment.
Although the new study did not find a lower mortality rate, Blackstone said it did confirm that individuals with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it shows that surgery is safe in the lower BMI group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the BMI is between 27 and 30.
"We're waiting too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When a person's body has accumulated genetic changes that predispose them to obesity and diabetes, it's really difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said. According to him, the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A leading figure in Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to the violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis in a speech during his visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama gave his speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must take precedence over individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible to think that everyone could come to Europe," the Dalai Lama said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama said.
"After all, we need to think about how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
Force has never solved problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks and claimed that when he resorted to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After the September 11 attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Hand sanitizer ingestion cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Georgia Poison Center, poison centers across the United States report that cases of heavy hand sanitizer ingestion in children under the age of 12 have nearly quadrupled since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitization reported to poison centers in children under the age of 12 increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are becoming more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hand sanitizer on purpose, some to impress their friends and some to be stimulated by social media.
YouTube videos feature teenagers drinking disinfectant because of cheap hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcoholic mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink even stronger.
Younger children can be attracted by the smell of hand sanitizers.
"A child doesn't think that matter is bad," Lopez said.
"A lot of the appealing hand sanitizers are freshly scented.
Strawberry, grape and orange-flavored hand sanitizers are available to appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is 45-95%.
For young children, even a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"Hand sanitizer has a very high alcohol content," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a shot of whiskey within the reach of children, but if hand sanitizers are often left within the reach of children, you can quickly get a large amount of alcohol out of them."
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four stretches of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl had a blood alcohol level of 179, which is twice the adult drinking limit," said Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated the girl at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah sobbed and could not walk when she was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as the girl had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol wipes in addition to moving your hands out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a hand sanitizer containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health officials thought the product contained deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is listed as an active ingredient in the label.
According to a police report, three fourth-grade students in northern New York State in January were planning to kill an "evil" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and forbade bringing it into the classroom.
The police felt that the plan that had gone to waste was meaningless and called for disciplinary action on the school.

Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they are no longer allowed to watch Celtic and Rangers duels.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team management, stated: "The Netherlands no longer presents the highlights of Celtic's games.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
The Dutch miss the duels between the teams.
There is a huge tension in Old Firm's games, and they are also of interest outside Scotland's borders."
I turn the situation around, Deila assures
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures that the situation will change.
The club that lost to Malmö fell out of the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now have a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult periods before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it arouses anger or sadness in many.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We desperately need the support of Celtic supporters, as it will strengthen the players considerably.
Solidarity is really important now."
Warburton cautious on January player transfers
Although only a few weeks ago Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at the January player transfer targets, he is cautious about the transfer ruljanss and says he wants to jeopardize the team's unity.
"January player transfers differ significantly from summer transfers," Brentford's ex-coach said.
"The players joining the team in the summer will be able to get used to the team before the season starts, which has been a success in our line-up this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can do more harm to a team than good."
Michu, who thinks about retirement in Celtic's sights
Swansea striker Michu has been linked to Celtic in player transfer speeches, while Michu has hinted at retirement after the Swans contract ended.
29-year-old Michu has been bullied by an angry ankle for years and failed to get a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA fight over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-1. The defender's red card was later revoked. It is already the third Collum red card in eight months to be revoked.
Neilson, however, stands by his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on performance.
Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded when he admitted to luring abusive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before Edinburgh's local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming up, and the atmosphere was intense," the striker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice's management team believes in Dundee United's coaching leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures that the Dundee United management team can turn the situation around for the better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes welcomes Hamilton win with dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to hold out desperately against Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league win. With the win, Aberdeen grabbed a five-point neck in Celtic at the top of the league table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
"There's no cup or league winning team that hasn't won games like this," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Isles
THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED PERSONS remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164,000 unemployed, while the number of unemployed persons in the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 over the same period.
According to the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12,000 fewer people in work in Scotland than three months earlier, and the number is now 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with an average employment rate of 73.5% for the UK as a whole.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mundell commented on the recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly one year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for the revocation, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Correctional Facility while Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
I received the invitation in January through a man's best friend and, despite my shock, I answered yes to the invitation.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell the true story of the death penalty in this way.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists get to watch executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than locations, participants are selected by a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to five.
The chosen are following the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've talked on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to prison staff, I can't be there as both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to memorize the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him."
I disagreed with the reporter.
The journalist woman admitted that she could have phrased her words more carefully, but still thought my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tried to tell me what to do, I wouldn't.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist to be present, who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will promote the anti-death penalty movement.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want to learn more about this, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of aiding and abetting after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I cannot claim to be completely impartial.
An unbiased description can be read in the stories of other journalists.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die for nothing.
Man lured from Canning River after watery police chase
The Canning Vale area constable remained dry as he lured the man up the Canning River.
The Perth man's escape attempt came to a halt in shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few feet away was able to land the man back on dry land.
Canning Vale police received a call Tuesday about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arriving, police spotted a suspect who was trying to shake off the police by heading for the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not tempted to water his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic — negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt causes a person to resort to amusing means," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid being blown up by police and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the Rapture inspired locals to design the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody says officials tried to spy on him, and he threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria officials of trying to spy on his stables last year, threatening to stop racing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by officials and Racing Victoria's integrity department, and Lady Tatai's rejection due to the care given recently on race day was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to work for competitive sports. Moody has found himself in a difficult situation when cobalt was found in Lidar's sample and the man was unable to explain the finding.
Moody has held his tongue for 18 months on accusations of espionage, and did not want the accusations to seem like the actions of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration erupts once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes you have to react and accept the consequences, and now I have to accept the space after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want the owners of the horses to believe I'm doing the best I can.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't think it's a good idea for me to continue as a horse coach.
I would have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told of the integrity department's espionage efforts at his garage.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my garage with the intention of spying on my actions. I'll tell you the man's name when I ask," Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they would do well to present the evidence, as I have not been caught with anything unauthorized.
Former RVL Chairman Robert Roulston, current RVL Chairman David Moodie and current RVL CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the action then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the field on non-coachs?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Perhaps many people think so.
Maybe one day I'll get a coaching license and push me out of my job, and there's no doubt that with what I'm saying, I'm going to make a lot of people think that.
But I'm at a point where I don't care anymore, which is sad.
It's really sad.
I'm putting pressure on them to make their decision.
My family will support me, and I can withdraw."
A long-running investigation into the cobalt values of Lidar and a recent rejection situation eventually frustrated the coach so that he threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar. The man described the race day care rule as ridiculous after a clay wrapper was improperly placed on the horse's legs.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"A person in my staff mistakenly put clay on a horse's leg.
Clay therapy could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday during the day, and it did.
But it happened on race day."
Moody can be expected to face a three-month ban on illegal clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to work out.
"This is a joke.
The rules are set by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram crash victim arrested
Police have arrested a man who crashed into a cyclist over the weekend and fled the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, where he sustained serious injuries after a car collided with him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the man who drove the car fled the scene and did not stay behind to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathlalia reported to Shepparton police.
The man is likely to face charges of failing to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hints at opponents' wrestling speeches
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy regards his team's criticism of the tackle game as a purpose-seeking action of the two league favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to wrestle in a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night, to the annoyance of Melbourne's hosts.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up the reference to Storm after the Broncos won the qualifying final at the Queensland Cowboys Saturday night. He called the game a model match and stated that there was no particular concern about wrestling in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they only focused on contact when tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was enhanced by two top team coaches criticizing his team. Bellamy sees this as an indication that the coaches are worried about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I don't think Trent Robinson said anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-1," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything in our defense system or techniques all year, and for the past six weeks, we've only been investing in contact play and tackles, which has turned us on the rise.
Trent has been on his mission for three years, and losing may have been a shock to him because he has a great team that's not used to losing.
It is funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St George received a lot of criticism for his boring game. Wayne stated that the criticism doesn't bother him at all.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast central players.
That's the kind of football you want to play when you have an arsenal of players like this.
He highlighted this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have centers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence out of this when other coaches are so worried about facing my team that they resort to this kind of thing.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd face us in the big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored in the game between Storm and Roosters than in the Broncos' and Cowboys' encounters.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20-18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breaks and low goals an interesting game of football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably face them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will receive either the North Queensland Cowboys' Cronulla Sharks' upcoming Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man freed on $200,000 bail in drug case
In possession of a 40-pound shipment of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, a man awaiting a possible life sentence has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found 100 kilos of cocaine on board a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomera in August.
Police monitored a meeting between Maksimovic and an accomplice at the marina for the morning, and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse café.
Although Maximovic is possibly facing a life sentence for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, his lawyer says that there is no evidence that his client attempted to take possession of the entire batch, but that the man may have been in a cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan said there was a risk that Maximovic would try to flee the country.
"Maximovic clearly has ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather jointly paid the 200,000 bail he was released on.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"However, that alone is not enough to prevent a man from escaping," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and stay home from six in the evening until six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get possession of photos of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged in to an online messaging service, where he got another user to send him inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While browsing through the contents of her phone, the girl found some shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
After examining the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to the police that he was trying to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and that he was posing as a police officer with the intention of scaring pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson stated at a local court in Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation of people.
He admitted to doing the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so in order to impersonate the police and thus be able to intimidate pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead pedophiles.
He said he had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl screamed at her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw the inappropriate photos on the phone, after which Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the accused used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
23-year-old Hogg from Dundee's Ward Road pleaded guilty to possession of inappropriate child photos on June 14 last year. Hogg violated his bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders' register, as it can be considered that the crime did not include significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentencing until October due to social work background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this matter, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the Sex Offenders Register even before the day of the sentencing.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe makes wrong speech in parliament
Africa's oldest head of state, Mugabe, fell down the stairs to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but a video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by allegations by opposition party lawmakers that they have received anonymous death threats warning them against booing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and interrupted with interjections the President's State of the Union address in Parliament. The President made the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) whip, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that outside Parliament, representatives are no longer immune.
According to the party's whipper, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the business services business.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer businesses from the faster-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
According to HP, the company will record $2.7 billion in non-recurring expenses from the fourth quarter.
"The restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP CEO, who will head the company after the demerger.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we will have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help businesses transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
"As a company of our own, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of more than $50 billion and is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies, according to its mission.
Founded in the 1930s by Stanford University educators Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the company now splits into two. The two founded an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has undergone massive reorganizations as traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
The changes in HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in a field where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: Team must support injured Jack Wilshere before facing Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September, and if all goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four England national team games. Knowing the man's history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest annoyance of the latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strongly after an ankle injury and appeared to have returned to its former blade in the run-up to the new season.
"This type of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger noted.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
This is not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can occur when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different ailments since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in just 65 of 157 league games over the past five seasons.
The broader picture of Arsenal is that since the 2007-2009 season, six of the eight seasons, the team has been the second team to lose the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believe, last season's improved injury statistics will continue to evolve for the better.
"Sometimes there may be a vulnerable period of post-injury return when you need to strengthen your body and seek competitive advantage," Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body in balance, and I believe in that, and with it, his career will continue to be what he deserves."
Arsenal will start their Champions League contract on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the following Wednesday. Wenger is preparing minor changes to the line-up.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are the likely starters.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting line-up to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
While Arsenal are a clear favourite to continue the F-Group, Maximir Zagreb has some of the scariest stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been undefeated for 41 games by the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night as the ground shook at a magnitude of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned last season's lesson after having to give in to Monaco, and he is also motivated by the still distant hope of piloting the team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"This title has not yet been hit on Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also a realist by experience.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and young men's suicide rates are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 35 in the UK, with suicide being three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 the Year of Men. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study of 2,000 high school students found that people with depressive symptoms have a better chance of getting better if they are surrounded by enough healthy people.
The likelihood of asymptomatic persons also halved if there were persons close to them who do not have mental health problems.
However, friendships are the basis of everything.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalization of life, the need to appear strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Superficial success is associated with external values, money, image and social status. These all distract from internal values and our innate desire for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently stated that money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that the series turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by their profession, but by their personality. This was reflected in friendships.
The show humorously featured Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also often saw Ross missing Rachel. It was clear that the men could relate to this even though they do not refrain from feeling full.
One volunteer explained it to me this way: "Listening to people who are depressed and contemplating suicide, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong. A man is easily seen as weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendit is one of those series that sets out long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were emphasized.
Through the telephone I can offer help from the outside in a moment of despair, but long-term support is provided by people close to friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set has been brought to life. So if you're attending this weekend, you might want to take your friends out for coffee at Central Perk.
Or do something even better: smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can become.
Comedy Central broadcasts the entire Friends series — all 236 episodes — in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in shock when Paris Saint-Germain began work in the Champions League beating Malmö at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of playing the debut game. He strengthened the position of the French champions right out of the box. However, PSG botched several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted after 60 minutes of play.
Group A also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG not only aims for a further place in the playoffs, but also wants to improve their position for the quarter-final in the three remaining games.
Although SPG took the points, the match was not a perfect performance for a team led by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal-representation position and the man was forced to switch when facing his former home club, where he started his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win and good grip gives us a good base, even though we still have a lot to beat for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty for a win and we could do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after an injury. The team had to settle for a 2-1 draw in Ligue 1 against Bordeaux this weekend. However, Di Maria overshadows Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, which moved from Manchester United to PSG, was named PSG's solver, which raises the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the name as he rushed the ball from Marco Verratt's pass past Malmö's defence and then fired an accurate hit at the back corner of the goal past Johan Willand.
However, those who were waiting for PSG's crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international level players to the field from the start. A team playing with five men's defense and two strikers' tactics was hard to beat.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot barely missed Kevin Trapp's goal from the back post in the 34th minute of the game. The team wasn't very active.
Instead, PSG succumbed to unnecessary passing and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Immediately at the start of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick pitched to the back of the goal Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his claws in the pitching game. On Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria fired a round kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal came in the count's time thanks to Cavan, a Uruguayan who played his sixth season shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic pitched him a left winger for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's sprint ended in the second goal, and only Wiland's top scorer, David Luiz, shot at close range, kept the score under control, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was abandoned in the very end.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
Qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to the Parisians.
This was their top game."
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share issue
Swiss mining giant Glencore, which was hit by falling commodity prices, raised US$2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company's market value fell by 57% this year, wrestling with a collapse in raw material prices as the Chinese economic recession is hampering demand and putting a strain on the market.
With the offering, Glencore's share price climbed to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday for the start of the morning.
The stock rose 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a 0.69 percent increase.
Glencore last week announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in a share issue as part of its strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 pence, which is 2.4 percent down on Tuesday's closing price.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 percent of the Group.
Concerns over the continued recession in the Chinese economy have caused the price of iron ore to plummet by half, while the decline in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 and 40%.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
A White House statement on Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States on a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on September 25, a counter-visit after President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
After bilateral talks between the heads of state, the President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama arrange a dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to celebrate the state visit.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while allowing President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping to engage in constructive discussions on issues on which there is disagreement," the White House statement states.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February, and he is expected to visit Seattle to meet with several U.S. tech leaders. From Seattle, the president's trip would first continue to Washington and then to New York for the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern over China's alleged cyber espionage and increased actions by the country in disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and stated that diversity was not needed behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, the seasoned actor interrupted Brown when he explained the importance of noting the different views on the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is taken into account in film casting, not in program casting," Damon claimed.
Brown gasped, stunned and hurt by the claim. "Wow, that's clear," the woman stated after Damon's comment, who starred in the film Alone on Mars.
Damon and Brown, along with the other producers, the Ben Affleck and Farrelly brothers, had gathered to discuss the finalists for the race.
"Whoever the director is, I'd like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character is portrayed," Brown said at first.
"The only dark-skinned character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon bluntly replied that the choice of the two could lead to an undesired outcome.
When the debate aired on television, social media exploded with Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon is speaking on top of the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white-emphasizing that it hurts."
The tweet was shared over 5,000 times and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments come at a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is number one.
After a teenage Michael Brown died from a white police bullet in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained support across the country. The movement seeks to end discriminatory treatment of blacks by lawmakers and authorities.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the album nominees of the year at the Grammys.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and black people's lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Elisabeth Hasselbeck of Fow News's question about whether that group should be described as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," the movement's leadership said.
Damon is one of those entertainers, producers, and media moguls who have been invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known if Damon has accepted the invitation.
American Ninja Warrior Series First Winner
Professional climber and tableware collector Isaac Caldiero took his first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed for $1 million for his win.
For the first time in the seventh season of the TV series, all the given tasks were clarified.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
In the final task, the men had to climb up the 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the mission in the allotted time. She was the first contestant to successfully complete the fourth stage of the American Ninja Warrior race. However, Caldiero completed the mission three seconds faster and became the winner.
Caldiero told E!News after a tough fight that he was still in shock after taking the million-dollar pot.
"The payout is incredible, as I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his winning pot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what's going to come of this, the future is wide open."
Executive producer Kent Weed spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten is not being rewarded, although she was the first contestant to complete all the missions.
"Rules say the fastest person wins the prize money.
If more competitors figure out all the tasks, the fastest one will win," Weed explained.
"Of course, the money prize is stunning and will revolutionize life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from her performance.
I don't think he's going to stay around any longer.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from his fans.
Britten is a great guy for whom family is important.
His children and wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win, he preferred to play the victory for Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have felt the same way about him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for season eight, with filming starting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers win over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Detroit Tigers don't have a particularly nice experience in the second half of the season.
One of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in American League Central.
However, the team was successful on Tuesday by beating the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to get close to the Houston Astros to fight for another wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even if only for one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind the rock in the second half of the season.
"Every win is a nice one, however it is achieved," Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held out when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and once again in the ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched a 6 1/3 turn good game and let off three runs.
He's only had three good starts in nine outings.
"I just want to finish the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for an exchange player to throw in every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth shift."
Tigers pitcher substitute Victor Martinez scored three hits and hit two runs, his first since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit night since he got four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept the momentum in the game."
In the latter inning of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Center cop Byron Buxton started the shift with a two-bay shot near the left flank line.
The right winger Aaron Hicks hit a self-sacrifice punch, and Simon took the turn of second to Brian Dozier, who took three straight passes before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free pass for Mauer, and rookie pitcher substitute Miguel Sano hit a two-bay shot, followed by right-handed Drew VerHage.
When there were two runners on the field, VerHagen got Trevor Plouffen on third to burn two players.
The Major League team led for the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit beat a qualifying run in the first shift of the ninth, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon hit a two-run shot, and the score was 5-1.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight passes and was able to hold his team position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran who had just made it back to the field from the injured list. The man was on the sidelines for a month due to a back infection.
"Of course, the start wasn't what I'd hoped for, but as the game progressed I started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to do a decent performance and a few good passes in the third inning," Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave a one-nest hit to second Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real catcher J.D. Martinez's freestyle brought Victor Martinez the first imported run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 streak was broken when the team had players in the bases.
Three's Nick Castellanos next got one hive hit, one run, but Victor Martinez burned while trying to advance to three.
The Tigers increased their lead in the second innings, with catcher James McCann surviving a hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first, making the score 3-0.
"Quite a hit," comments Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but the shot hit the right spot."
The pitcher was Hughes, who pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was traded for a right-handed substitute striker, A.J. Achter.
Hughes's balance came in three runs, six hits, a free pass and four straight assists.
Notable: Tigers right-handed batter Anibal Sanchez was not in the lineup due to a shoulder-to-shoulder rupture.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list due to a shoulder rupture since mid-August, and was scheduled to join on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, left-handed striker Daniel Norris leaves the injured list and is part of the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris has scored 1-1 in four games since being traded to left-handed batter David Price on July 30.
He has been out of the line-up since August 20 due to an oblique ab muscle rupture.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) takes on Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the rest of the world
"The economic system must open up to the rest of the world to promote growth," President Xi Jinping said Tuesday at a meeting of the economic reform steering group on Tuesday.
"China should commit itself to attracting foreign investment and expertise and to developing an economic opening policy," the president said at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Board established to deepen comprehensive reform.
"By advancing the policy of opening up and deepening reforms, a new impetus and vitality for economic growth will be launched," Xi said.
The management team adopted guidelines that included a negative list to regulate market access, a relaxation of border control policy, the promotion of private capital inclusion in state-owned enterprises, and a review of the citizen registration system.
According to the communication, a negative list of sectors and companies in which investment is prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system is being tested gradually and is being developed through test programs.
According to the communication, this is a significant change, as it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, a legal business environment and market opening.
The government also mitigates corporate control and wants to ensure that companies have decision-making power over their own business.
According to the communication, China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border regions, as well as the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
With the opening of state-controlled sectors, many industries are opening up to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment; it will support the legitimate interests of companies that have received foreign funding and provide them with better services," the communication states.
In addition, applying for a permanent residence permit by optimizing the requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also dealt with the right of lawyers to practise their profession and support for judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and party leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
