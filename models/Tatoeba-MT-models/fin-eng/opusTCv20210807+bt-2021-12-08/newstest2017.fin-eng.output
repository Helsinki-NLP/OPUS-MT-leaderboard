28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him, and states, "His affairs finally went well."
The body, which was found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was ruled a homicide and that an investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line chef in Boston, had received his dream job as line chef at Sons & Daughters in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "horrified and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be greatly missed," the representative said.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank initially stayed in hostels, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well".
"He found an apartment and was seeing a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was good-natured and had a big heart.
His way of feeling connected with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drifted with the flow.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with information on the matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Demands for new industrial action
Representatives of medical trainees have asked their trade union to approve new industrial action measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is asking the entire Council to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns over the deal.
Medical interns and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement that had been agreed with the BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members via Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "self-absorbedly silent" on issues that she said led to the deal being rejected.
He said, "In this light, the JDC government has voted to completely reject the proposed new deal and demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain a mandate for a progressive and expanding industrial action program beginning early in September.
As a result of the dispute, medical interns have participated in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health care system.
The head of the BMA's medical trainees, Dr. Johann Malawina, resigned after the vote rejected the terms negotiated in the agreement, recommended by the BMA.
He had told members of the BMA at meetings before the 54,000 doctor trainees and students vote that the deal was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: a coalition of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month-long battle of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I had the clear impression that there is more desire for this reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, there was a handshake at the event.
But Putin's smile looked forced, and he didn't exude much warmth, even according to his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, kept talking about his "beloved friend" Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also vowed that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but even better.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal reflected the opposite.
But the coolness radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led an astounding, thorough assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade from ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
He has emphatically denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to move on.
In the end, this meeting happened only because Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of agreeing to an armistice are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was nearly deposed in last month's failed coup.
The ongoing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also a financial motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
As for Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush into the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruits and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey were once again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
Add to that the long-standing resentment over the snail-paced EU membership talks, and Putin emerges eager to exploit the coolness and erode Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, where he called after a revolutionary attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the flamboyant seaside palace made it possible for the "association of outsiders" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that feel they have been abandoned and mistreated by the West, to join forces.
However, the two have major differences despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be telling that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even addressed the issue.
The Turkish President knowingly avoided answering the question regarding their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full-scale disaster as NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better for the two leaders to be on speaking terms again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international ambitions.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these goals.
The bank's strategists have been using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance brands during this time.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been deemed right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with customers in Scotland, but it will not be restarted from scratch.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for the head office and stock exchange listings are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a round-up of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our brand of investors and the employer of our employees, because we will now become much more of a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in their respective communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, and has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move in the direction of a brand bank, because basically (we've been asking) it's about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after having a total of 3,000 wins after a double win
Racing rider Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached a milestone with his second win of the evening on his home track while competing with Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The Dettori absorbs cheers as he leads Predilection out after the victory.
The two racers have reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best race riders of the current era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical wit sets him apart in the weighing room.
He is a great ambassador for the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-game jockey!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but on top of that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flimsy landing from the saddle.
From flying-nosed finishes to flying-nosed landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
Stacks of victories in the big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and suffered a ban from competition due to drugs.
Three years ago he had a difficult start when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed remarkable strength of character when challenging the doubters and returning in his best shape.
And he may go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years of age.
Russia's Putin sacks Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin has "ordered Ivanov to step down as head of the Russian presidential administration", but this was not given a reason.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later, he led the presidential protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state when it comes to drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended that the Persecution be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has perplexed Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin shown on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, few people here are convinced - especially not now, right before the general election.
So is this just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with real skepticism.
In comments quoted on the Kremlin website to Putin, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in a debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if only one could say laborious, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the assignment in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB, as is Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
When Putin came to power, he cited Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
'Criminal Minds' star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month on the set of the show in Los Angeles.
The series producers, ABC Studios as well as CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and strife on the set.
I regret that it happened," he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how to remove Gibson's character from the series about a team of FBI agents are expected later.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the Dharma & Greg sitcom, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it my all for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, most importantly, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the series' twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery fish end up in a garden in Banff
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be the windfish left behind by the vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted film footage of the apparition on Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing Crossing: Bridge now extends to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry overpass with the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "deck fans", which are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ridge ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of the Economy Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry overpass.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this bridge section alone."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, finishing the barrier between the ground bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation where extreme precise dimensions must match.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the concrete deck for the last section of the deck is cast today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first lock on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this bracket represents the cutting edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck had been installed and connected to the expanding road deck of the north pillar, we then had to close the remaining section on the north, or inland, side.
This was done by pulling the northern fairway land bridge 700 millimeters in the direction of the south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
Huge, because the land bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at an angle of gradient of about 3%.
Demanding because the allowed dimensional deviations the team was working on were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, all went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'lucky to be alive'
The three men are "lucky to be alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alert at 1:20 p.m. (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helmsman of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, a strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted hanging from a buoy without a lifejacket.
The men were taken into a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
There was a kill-cut rope in the boat's engine, but it was somehow disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the boat capsized.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a venerable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but preferring to spend their free time watching screens.
Pokémon Go causes people to get off the couch and participate in some activities.
Screen time was originally limited to television, then to video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to a craze called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later they became a cartoon series, playing cards and other follow-on products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was postponed, as huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
Explained in a nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS, and can be "photographed" (via a screenshot of the phone) or "catched" after being found.
A generation who played the game when they were younger has joined the craze and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent in the users Cardiogram tracked.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the training level data.
The calls by many public health campaigns to "find 30", "get up on the couch" and "be active every day" have yielded no results because most public health warnings are boring and are delivered by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be underestimated.
People who move regularly have a lower risk of developing cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, disapproving pranksters look for things to complain about here.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
And then?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there used to be apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn't give a reason to move in the same way that this game did.
The novelty disappears and use subsides in time.
However, due to Pokémon's success, there will be other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles captures gold in women's gymnastics multi-tasking
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energetic in jumps.
Smooth boom.
Incredible on the floor.
Brilliant everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-tasking championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall score, 62,198, was clearly better than that of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States with a balance boom in the finals of the women's gymnastics multi-match individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Partyes became the fourth American woman to consecutively win a multi-match championship, and the fifth American champion overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement puts him in the same category as the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated his sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 golds, with programs whose mixture of ambition and accuracy has been so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
The final test was waiting in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
Going back to the family home in Spring, Texas without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the women's rack gymnastics multi-match individuals final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday when he served as the culmination of the departure party of the retiring national team coordinator, Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought about the future while going his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes the flip-over of his trademark - is adapted to Latin American music that would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic Arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother when she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a powerhouse.
He has not lost in a multi-match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak is likely to continue for as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the permanto, where Biles is the reigning world champion, waited.
He climbed to the top with 15,433 boom points and surpassed them by 15,933 perms.
Raisman hugged him benevolently as they waited for the final points - a mere formality - and tears rose into Biles's glitter red, white, and blue capped eyes as the dream he once wrote in his scrapbook became a reality.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago, when he was in shared third place, but lost a bronze to Mustafina in the replay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who Americans call "Grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent kisses to the audience after his perm performance in an emotional uproar over the return, which at times seemed questionable.
As for the party, this 19-year-old's widespread tweet from earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial murder shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack of Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead in a car parked in the driveway on June 12.
The gunman, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, fired the handgun up to eight times and then escaped in another vehicle.
Police said the triple homicide did not appear to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the purses or $2,900 from another adult victim.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks over a four-month period in two predominantly Latin American neighborhoods.
"These are happening in a residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS affiliate KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also issued a police bulletin about the shooting, which took place only half an hour before the triple murder, and targeted an empty pickup truck, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings, a bullet in the seat, and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is a little-headed, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, didn't know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers as well as sing.
Elizabeth shows how Edmund's invented signs sign "Sing for me".
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is no ordinary sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different causes: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
Things are getting easier.
You can believe it's going to get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected for the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi overflowed their banks and posed a widespread flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities, and that help is already coming to the counties that need it.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said they were receiving requests for high tide vehicles, boats, and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipohoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five centimetres of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and were predicted to set a flood peak record over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that there is a threat of flooding in Ascension County, lower down the river, as the flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
South of the Mississippi state border, the Tickfaw River in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its all-time high at 9:00 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still picking people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the water at Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen the water in the creek so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have injuries, and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station, where the rescued stayed overnight on Friday.
Krautmann says the floods "spread quickly" as heavy rains continue, and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of Tangipahoa County residents from their homes, as well as the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, officials said.
CBS subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
County chairman, Robby Miller, said authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets trapped by high tide.
Covers have been opened in the towns of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipoha County, about twenty streets were closed due to high tide, and residents were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County emergency director Rupert Lacy said that steady rain continued along the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but so far no flood incidents have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still raining."
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown 'full of bullets' survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, meaning another shooting of a six-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, hand, and stomach, among others, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother, tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the station that he is expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first grade at a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether either of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was crossfire between several shooters.
Assault-type shells, originating from a variety of attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a constant battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it looks like there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active combat," Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, police are investigating the tapes on the surveillance camera.
Another six-year-old, a girl, was hit in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also established the presence of black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised as an Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they present unexpected but masterful gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to consecutively win individual gold in a women's multi-match.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the sport, but the situation doesn't look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" (the last five) because at the next Olympics there will only be four gymnasts on the gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karolyi's final year as coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts, as a rule, practice in private gymnastics clubs, which are run by parents who pay for coaching, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts, as well as families), and the list goes on.
Much of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
In these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they began gymnastics.
We need to bring affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have offered free and inexpensive gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Latino) and have coached national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, as well as school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We live in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young womanhood.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff members, but 58% of the 37,000 medical interns who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was on "unknown ground," and that even minor further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first doctor trainees will be transferred to a new contract, which will include changes to the nocturnal and weekend working methods to improve care during the difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainee Committee, said last night in a statement: "Dr. Trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, especially that it will accelerate the existing labor crisis, and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and at times with deep silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt should act now, lift the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical interns.
If he does not, the medical trainees are prepared to continue the industrial action.
The latest strike at the end of April meant nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments were postponed when nurses and consulting doctors were recruited to serve as replacements for doctors on strike.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 medical interns under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, "Labour struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services that are already in a demanding situation, and cause worry, anxiety, and disruption to patients, caregivers, and their families."
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of surveillance (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that continued positive discussion on other important topics - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from sabbaticals, costs of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave, and gender pay differentials in medicine - will be a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England education organization, and the Ministry of Health are about respecting the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February, and May.
A drug costing £2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are taking advantage of a £2 a day drug after authorities recommended it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant drug, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another seizure.
NICE, the NHS's supervisor, has advised that it should be administered to people for four years to further lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to still lower the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack in England each year, and a quarter of these suffer a second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a build-up of fat in the artery wall, which forms stenosis.
If the stenosis ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks loose, it can travel with the blood and cut off the blood supply to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, lowers this risk by making clotting less likely.
A draft NICE guideline published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective progression-preventing treatments, up to a quarter of people who suffer a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in lowering the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we tentatively recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to add the available treatment options to the many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Due to the limited data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially with regard to the risk of bleeding - over periods of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was removed from office last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the government's report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, revealed today in a shocking government report.
The former government minister, Sir Eric Pickles, rails against police, election officials and city councils for ignoring evidence of election fraud because of "racial and religious hypersensitivity".
The former community secretary, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to place guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present identification when voting to prove who they are.
Today, voters only have to state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for wider press access to council documents and decisions made by informal committees or a working group.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would protect local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned the report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal actions.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was a religious duty for faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting performing as someone else.
Sir Eric said that evidence of fraud can be found throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about voting for election fraud by mail, where high-ranking members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for the candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including proving identity with ID
He said: "Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that...state institutions had ignored such behavior due to 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists handling ballots received by mail in order to stop 'vote-gathering'.
The report, which Theresa May is reviewing, also calls for tougher checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Look at the options for proving the identity of voters before voting.
Use indelible ink on the finger of the voting person so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to make sure they are eligible to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic voting via mail.
Prevent political activists from dealing with ready-made ballots and envelopes through the mail where the ballots are sent.
Let the police set up guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal in polling stations.
Require that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adheres to the rule that the voter should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric kills the Greater London Police Force, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court stayed Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality," he said.
He was found guilty on numerous grounds without a doubt, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticized ineffective "tick-in-the-box checks" in city council vote registration offices.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the birther of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good name."
Crazy about Kate's cyclist doppelganger and other celebrity expression images at the Rio Olympics
This week fans at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have gone crazy over French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be the impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and Wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team Member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike track, many people online have been quick to point out how one particular archer could be a star Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his photos surfaced in which he looks frighteningly similar to the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, becoming aware of the fervor of social media, the archer admitted that since childhood he has heard that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance myself, except maybe with the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will surely emerge again this year: the startling resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with her big, expressive eyes, is said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has for years been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sporty version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist swimmer Yulia Efimova has more of the same with actress Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blonde hair, while US team Nathan Adrian recalls, according to fans, "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version."
Tough Women: Football Star Hope Solo, Left, and Dexter Actor Jennifer Carpenter, Right, Share a Similar Face Shape and Eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity between the pair
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness that "others on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress do indeed have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautifully wide smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic Commentator Apologizes After Saying Chinese Swimmer 'Dead Like a Pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200 metre freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the relay final of the women's 4x200 metres freestyle.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC commentator team to bring "color," was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China messed up, baby.
Too eager, disappeared like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in the women's freestyle 4 x 200 metres relay final as "That little 14-year-old from China messed up, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was robust and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users did not hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusting."
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized on live television for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment about the swimming performance was put on the air.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commentator fellow Scott Russell had to apologize on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and attached the apology to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The television company also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made, and that they were broadcast live.
We took swift action last night and apologized live to our viewers and followers on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize in the moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said on the CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance, not to him as a person."
Needless to say, I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and I'm really sorry."
Primark's client stunned by a woman who brazenly fitted underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman undressed in the middle of Primark's shop to try on her underwear.
Things were not improved by the fact that after assessing what he looked like in the pants, the woman peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He went on touring and eventually matched four pairs of underpants in a shop located at Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman fitted her underpants and then put them back on the shelf
Meanwhile, Jenny Davidson, a mother of two in the store, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed up again and walked out of the store without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of exposed underwear, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on her adaptables.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for the atonement, he just stood there shameless."
"Everybody was staring as he again took off his underwear and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again, and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried, but that hasn't been cleaned."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven't been washed."
Primark's spokesman said, "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at the Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
This is how you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Krav Maga Federation grandmaster Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "clear the line of fire."
You then grab the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue hitting the groin with the knee, and when the attacker goes out of pain, twist the gun from his hands, hit him in the face with the back of the gun, and retreat, keeping the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun, and turn it around so that the criminal is unable to fire.
At the same time, put weight on the gun and strike the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grasp, back away and point a gun at him.
Does that sound awkward?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does this.
But remember that if you are not the Grand Master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks some of Europe's dirtiest places for a travel guide
The British traveler has set a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, licked a euro banknote, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on the train's toilet, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment, which was made into a movie called On the Track of Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the train flush button used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his journey across Europe, Wright constantly spoke to doctors and medical professionals about gut bacteria strengthening and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a tester of his gut endurance as he traveled around the world and ate strange and miraculous things.
This task, extending from the public railings of railway stations to the flush button on the toilet seat, did indeed test his immune system.
In the film, he said, "Since I was a child, I've been pretty carefree about my health, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth, starting with dirt, worms, and muddy water."
He certainly cemented his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the reading for newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer's result was more than 4,000 units, and the result of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, On the Track of Inner Power, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is pretty much the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting here.
On the trail of inner power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to boost people's gut bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, director of snacks, juice and new categories at Valio, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch, while at the same time explaining the probiotic benefits.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'let's call Ian.'"
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in gut health is a worldwide phenomenon, and this documentary film allows us to tell more about it in an interesting way to consumers.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, the director of the documentary, added, "Let's just say this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him, like the disgusting Russian toilet that was shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things to lick were easier for Ian, while some were quite tricky.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty licks recorded."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to abdominal and intestinal well-being, and 58% said that they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of bullies destroyed a tenement house in Saltash, Cornwall, before being evicted.
A family of bullies caused £50,000 in damage to their rented house after they were evicted due to terrorizing neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being complained about numerous times.
After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing company officials stated that the property was in poor condition.
The walls had gaping openings, floorboards had been torn, debris had been spread on the floor, and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she fears the property cannot be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the residents, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is disreputable, and their name is disreputable."
The couple had three sons who sometimes lived in the property, and police said the family's reign of terror included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug sales, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease, received a decision on antisocial behavior.
Many rooms in the house under the threat of demolition were found with old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs have previously been delivered, had been uprooted.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting in the street, and that police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted the woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of time, 11 weeks, to voluntarily move in.
The relieved neighbors thanked the eviction, saying that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here an incredible number of times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down the feral wall of the tenement house.
He added, "It's a shame that the resident didn't take any responsibility for his or her own and his or her family's behavior, as eviction is always the last policy considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave community members who informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that the three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their twenties.
Dirty mattress left on one bedroom floor after eviction
Housing company employees now have to clean up the waste piles around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis, along with a scale, supplies, and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in an attempt to distribute it.
He claimed that the money was intended for the tombstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner now live homeless in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say they are trying to evict residents who are flouting the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message for those who think their behavior is without consequences, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew near the shore
Sun-worshipping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane sweeps past really low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
It was at this moment that terrified tourists began to panic as a low-flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows a military aircraft coming close to contact with sun worshippers on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise from the jet, although they did not initially see what was coming at them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice at really low altitude, and at one point it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and it really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a plane emerged from the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said the jet had flown significantly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby wildfires, but the Air Force assured him that no one's safety was in danger.
Parts of mainland Portugal have been destroyed by fires this summer, and four people have died from them on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of conditions that hindered visibility, smoke caused by wildfires, and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Eksote's first half-year result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health Care District (Eksote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote's profit showed a surplus of EUR 4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where it has been possible to dismantle institutional care by developing preventive services.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, Eksote aims to shorten the queues for measures.
The exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The remaining portion of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Frontier Rangers sworn in at Immola
The Border and Coast Guard School's 70 conscripts took the military oath on Friday.
A military swear-in ceremony for the Border and Coast Guard school conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Jaeger Course ceremony was held on the garrison's sports field.
Seventy conscripts took the military oath.
Special Rangers are trained for demanding border security, reconnaissance and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become special border guards.
250 of them were invited to take the selection exams.
Special Rangers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime frontier forces were present at the Veterans' Meeting held in connection with the oath ceremony.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
A circle ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police departments has operated an RTA, or Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Chief of Staff is the Chief Inspector in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in plainclothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers in Häme.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would rarely leave until they received an alarm.
With the help of the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where they are most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a single criminal intelligence centre, its three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were established in each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in connection with the National Bureau of Investigation in Vantaa, manages operations nationally.
As the name suggests, PTR units employ people from the Police, Customs and the Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Enquiry extends beyond your area
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the entire police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, an alert task database and observations to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, prolific criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint can also be seen in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, a certain image is formed of the perpetrator.
Serialization can be done based on either the method of the act or the person, depending on which one the police have more information about.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of their own methods as well as those used by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent attempts by the police to prevent crime.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they anticipate that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the way in which vacant dwellings were marked in early summer, used in house burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, pin, or piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-trial investigation material is public at least to the parties involved.
The Analysis Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The smartest people order the district court's minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
For the case, Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen from the Häme Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the National Bureau of Investigation have been interviewed.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
Against the background of a decrease in the volume of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new course of action were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation is used to collect information from outside one's own institution and Finland's borders.
ISIS-affiliated schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to his family, he died just as he was planning to escape the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can serve as a tombstone and testament to others, that there are real risks involved in going into a war zone - that it could deter people from making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that the girl had married an ISIS fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton will keep Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will elect a person to replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday in a teleconference that he predicts "with some degree of certainty" that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's spokesman later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "armies" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
Treats says the naked calendar is for "women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they plan to find the next top model generation for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with lots of nude photos is different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them too.
"We need to start showing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be a part of this project because it is beautiful art.
Models can leave photos online or in person at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before rushing to fill the comment section with irritable insults written by the pseudonym NoAll Lonely Middle-AgedMen, note that this claim is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much talked about re-emergence of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited by the novelty of physical objects, but by the longing for middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a vinyl record are most likely between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, those in the age group of 18 to 24 are the least likely to buy records.
It's also not just about collecting for hobbyists, it's about emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be waving livelyly before I stopped, forming a cup out of my hands, and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's take a closer look."
Let's take a closer look.
While the charm and dirt of Soho is slowly being removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, as well as office supply stores now fill the buildings where there used to be independent stores - a handful of fabulous specialized record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while as I stand very close to a variety of men in some of these stores trying to judge by observing their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart of Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and strolls around the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent the sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge amount of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: now he can buy records he couldn't afford when they were originally released, and he can re-buy those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records released when I was 11 or 12, records I was probably a little too young to acquire," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding, "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad."
25-year-old Wez, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients she encounters fit YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the enthusiasm of the media, people who have heard that the records have come back into fashion and for whom it has become necessary to buy back their old records.
Based on the conversations I have had, people have usually gotten rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakenings at a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of the records?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar record covers; items that evoke memories of teenage happy days.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a gap or some kind of comfort that owning things creates," Wez says.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It is an easy way to fill your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker suddenly said from the disk pile.
An opinion poll conducted by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned as I browse the stack of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the revival is something that Jonny, 42, also working in Sounds of the Universe (counter: three middle-aged men) has noticed.
"Someone came in a while ago and said, 'I don't have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
This is not a big part, but it definitely is.
More product, less music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a record player."
Not the older ones, but the younger ones, the late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Foppi, which now has almost an entire floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their seventies, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned stores - the speakers are the latest synth and sex-filled pop from Wild Beast, and not the improv jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the gnawing psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes, looking at the various records on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so collecting records isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on the computer or some other way, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at jeans shorts, I'm observing a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before the father and daughter contemplate buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase with a wall covered with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high up that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art vinyl".
But given that even the slightest attention these items receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho to get more, there is not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items, such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street record stores, flipping through records and avoiding the creepy, 30-year-old fake TV host's gaze as he peers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is for a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, who is five meters tall.
French court rejects application to tear down shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an application by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect's office argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a non-taxable parallel economy and are a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
A court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting people running 72 temporary shops, but said that the concern of the Calais Prefect "was perfectly understandable."
Justice Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes, and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people in "extremely precarious conditions".
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened with demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which operates a non-profit and provides 200 meals daily, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 - a peak - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food prices are falling sharply in Finland to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while its price fell by 0.9 per cent on average in EU countries.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
In the past three years, the price of food in Finland has fallen second most in those EU countries with wages similar to those in Finland.
Of the comparison countries, only in the UK has food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The information comes from an article by Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose sharply.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is being weighed down by the food import bans imposed by Russia, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Tighter price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been seen as spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a haven for cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland among EU countries with wages similar to those of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by value added tax.
He found that if the control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven per cent in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level in the EU countries and the price competition must continue," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations at the VAT rate are indicative.
The school is no longer the same.
A person returning to the school bench may find that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been prepared for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline according to which all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan states the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
For example, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education starts in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are already starting in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is how schooling is made more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Even known as the ice shark, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It could live another 250 years after that, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known specimen is dated to 507.
The Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than males, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to monitoring only about a centimeter per year, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the ages of adult ice sharks from the 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied turned out to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimetre Amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are over four metres tall, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 - sellers will not be reduced
Nearly 300 employees are laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
The co-operation companies in the troubled company ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in the reduction of approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be carried out as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of vendors of department stores will not be reduced, so that customer service will not suffer.
In addition, about 80 support function employees are offered a new job as a salesperson.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations affected approximately 3,000 employees.
When they started, the reduction need was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are expected to materialise next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store trade is still making a loss.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann's acting CEO, sales in department stores have not met the targets set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen says in a press release.
The result improvement in the second quarter was particularly due to the good success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best ever second-quarter revenue and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group had an operating profit of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees all over the country
The low-pressure centre on top of the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There will also be rain showers in the central parts of the country, but further south there will be poutine.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, it remains between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenya's Athletics Team Is Shaken by Doping Scandal - Strange Explanation for Coach's Rapture
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that Anzrah appeared as a national team athlete on a doping test.
The Associated Press reported that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform was 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials came to report Anzrah to the authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "committed his crimes against the Kenyan national team."
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot tolerate such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, thundered news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics begins on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner will be aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year on the way and is one of Rio's winning favourites in advance.
According to Reuters, a source inside Kenya's athletic team claimed that Anzrah was traveling on an athlete's accreditation card only to receive free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials confronted him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken for a test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletic Stadium empties its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
A battle for athletics medals was started in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to the bafflingly empty stands.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day's morning games and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening games have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium bulged with cheering crowds.
Tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The lack of spectators at the Rio Olympics has attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazil's medal hopefuls Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, with 12,000 spectators only filling about 30 percent.
The poor performance is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with financial difficulties, is far away for European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange for Brazilians accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team was not able to fill the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, said that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, a figure clearly lower than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over one thousand euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this has not yet been allowed in Rio because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to school children in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at the Rio Stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sands of Copacaba has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
People in the gallery were enough.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
After that, private individuals, businesses, and corporations can use the money to claim rights to the land.
The foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into parcels, which can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right of ownership for a fee.
The holder gets the right to veto his 187-square-foot block, which basically means that approval is not required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Acquiring a right of possession is something tangible that can be left as a legacy or gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself up somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
A person who has acquired the right of possession will receive accurate location information from their block, which will allow, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation's website, the names of those who have acquired the rights are displayed on the same map where the parcel information for the land can be found.
Leviäkangas sees the risk of its nature conservation acquisition only as the foundation's operations change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a non-profit foundation to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow operate unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The foundation acquires land either by purchase or as a donation.
It mainly finances its operations through the sale of rights to bearers, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected lands.
It also aims beyond Finland's borders and plans to acquire land in Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its operations in a pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market Square from 13 to 19 August.
Bicycle thieves are the worst hitters of major cities in Turku - see the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves are the ones who torment Turku the most from Finland's big cities.
This year, more bikes have been stolen relative to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Based on the reported thefts of bicycles by police, Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and their parts per 1,000 inhabitants stolen in the ten largest cities between January and August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police reports, there were between four and five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In some cities, there are double the number of thefts per capita compared to others," says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the National Police Board.
The police in Turku wonder why the city is at the top of the ranking.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much people move around the city on bikes and how many bikes there are at all," ponders Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will take the top spot in the comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to what are the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a compact centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transportation," Reen says.
In Finland as a whole, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have been reported by the police in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
Still, there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police become aware of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts each year.
That means 50-60 fillers every day and about 4,000 bikes a year in Helsinki alone.
"Those are big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, as only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report theft of a bicycle, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police survive.
A typical solved bike theft is one in which the police are informed immediately of the theft and the thief is caught in the act.
"Cases are also found in connection with other investigations when, for example, stolen bikes may be found in an apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in the act or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from the bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses and bicycle cellars of shopping centres, i.e. practically everywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual bike models, Jopoja is the most stolen, as in previous years.
A U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but much of the stolen bikes end up being sold, for example, online.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police's attention that there's a lot of stolen bikes going abroad," Reen says.
According to police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them will probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful, as he or she may commit a concealment crime or offence.
"The alarm bells should ring if a bike in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colourful Nopsa always to the shelters of Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He's had five bikes, but none have been stolen, says Moose. "Never been taken, so far has been a good monk."
"Perhaps this doesn't so much attract thieves, this doesn't necessarily have a hipster value either," Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who was quick to visit a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike slumped against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks his bike in something solid, such as a bike rack.
"It's going to be a lot of thought, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a student in Helsinki about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from the guys that the bikes have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such snotty Jopos."
A bicycle was stolen from Valve from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
However, the bike had remained unlocked, so Valve was expecting it to be usurped.
Children under 15 to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to try out peer-to-peer jurors from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from falling into a vicious circle of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to children under the age of 15, who will now be left without criminal responsibility.
A peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is for the peer jury to discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join a peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Executive Director Tommi Laitio says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that are used side by side.
"Everybody steers the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer jury has been modeled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after their first crime, does not get in front of an adult panel, but reflects on what happened with someone about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Service designer Iikka Lovio from Palmu, the service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, the first crimes committed by persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The peer-to-peer jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio emphasises that new ways of working are offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republican Influencers Want Party to Stop Funding Trump Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, which had received a draft of it.
According to the paper, the open letter is aimed at Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be diverted to Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, along with his disregard, incompetence and record unpopularity, threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is prominently anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy is doing well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so the economy will do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a handshake for American laborers who suffer as factories move to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in well-paying jobs since World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway when he emphasized that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
"As president, I am opposed to any trade deal that works against workers or wages," Clinton said.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton intended to criticize the Republican Donald Trump's economic program on Monday for "favouring only millionaires like this one."
Trump's proposed cut in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called "Trump a loophole."
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner herself.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton said.
Here are the Rio ratings: The Games have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports competitions appear as sharp mountain peaks in television viewing statistics.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached huge numbers of spectators.
At one time, the competitions have glued 12 per cent of the population to the screens: Tuesday evening swimming was followed by 615,000 spectators from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships a month ago drew almost 800,000 viewers to TV2 at a time, and the European Football Championships well over a million.
So far, the most interested Olympic sports have been Sunday night cycling and the rack gymnastics that opened the fifth day of the Games, both of which reached almost half a million spectators at a time.
Yle sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that spectators will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics is the first sports event for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes in 24 hours a day, and there are from 20,000 to 500,000 viewers all that time, that's a good base.
The number of spectators is smaller than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts come in Finland at night.
Another reason for the mellow interest - if you consider it a mellow one - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the opening games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial ratings have been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics starts, ratings go up.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the Games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the Games in Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're already about 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get online ratings until later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not worked as expected for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and faults have been corrected.
The use of the Rio Arena has been accompanied by delay and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics can be seen on Yle's channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed on the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Puhe relays races every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious Yle has ever seen, but also the last that can only be followed from Yle's channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports can be seen on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, with a depth of 95.3 metres on Ristinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technical dive instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square metres on Ristiselkä, the depth of which the dive computer looked like 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonar extraction.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 metres) and Suvasvesi (90 metres).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi reach more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been accurately mapped.
"There could well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is Great Lake Juka, 23 meters.
When viewed this way, Päijänne does not get to the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected the last paragraph, where the deepest lakes in average depth were wrong.
Ihalainen on tax cuts: Pensioners' taxation still more strained
Pensioners' taxation is still more strained than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievances came up before the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
This is not included in the government's proposal.
In our opinion, that should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income deductions that eased taxation.
The matter heated up opposition representatives in the parliament, who grilled the then Finance Minister Alexander Stubb (college) about the election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (College) on tax cuts is mainly about securing purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year wages will not be increased.
He says that tax cuts will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (centre) and Orpo's messages about the desire to honour the hard-won Competitiveness Pact.
He says sticking to the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be undermined by questioning.
It comes in need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Dealing with long-term unemployment in the throes
Ihalainen appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
There were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will elude.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No known Finnish casualties in Thai attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finnish time.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists planning to visit Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand takes place at the turn of the year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular for information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No knowledge of the author
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The ambassador thinks the events may be related to the political unrest in Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who declared their opposition to the law.
In Thailand's southernmost provinces, on the other hand, there is an ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks are likely to affect the course of the day so that authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police say.
At least four people have been killed in Thailand in the space of 24 hours after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourists' favourites Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded in the night on holiday island Phuket, a tourist destination popular with Finns, according to the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
A total of four bombs have exploded in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, yesterday and today, according to local officials.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both the village of Surat Thani and the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown.
Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the leader of the military junta that dominates Thailand, says the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite more people to panic," he told reporters.
Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the deputy prime minister in charge of security, said at least the Hua Hin and Trang attacks were linked.
He told the Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to pay attention and avoid the busiest tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to go to Thailand to cancel their trip due to the explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Grand Mission for caution, Westphalen says.
Injured Europeans
Very little is known so far about the attacks and their victims that took place during the Finnish night.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's latter attack.
Two bombs exploded near the bell tower known as the attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have cordoned off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found yet another bomb.
Surat Thani's bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal worker was killed in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the attack on Surat Thani, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's quadruple
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60.098 points and Russian Aliya Mustafina was third with 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for rack championships at the Rio Games in perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics as much as he can over the last few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanto championships three times in a row, as well as a boom last year and the year before.
The U.S. team at Biles has won two team competition world championships.
The fainter World Cup medals at the party have jumps and booms.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "The attack has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thailand's bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think anything more miraculous will follow, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many of the tragedies that have been experienced in Thailand from close quarters.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then there was the bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these previous ones haven't expelled the tourists, then probably this one hasn't either.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said it was not a good idea to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
At half past three in the day on Patong, traffic had normalized and a large number of shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the impact, the explosion has been quite small, Huovila says.
Later that car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby spruce.
Another man was immediately caught.
Another escaped, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft, theft and serious damage to a motor vehicle.
The police thank those who gave the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear set aside
On Friday, Russia made the highest-ranking leadership change in years when President Vladimir Putin sacked Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino from Estonia.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second-in-command.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from amassing too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from accumulating independent power for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has gotten into trouble with other executives or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will take on special duties in the fields of environment and transport.
In a tape presented by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be reassigned and proposed the persecution in his place, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high on the agenda in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most prominent people at the height of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's seat is that Putin changes his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters gained control of about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is unlawful, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen says to STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but it is based on the law.
Earlier, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants for the events of the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Director of Communications says that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform the practices.
Usain Bolt's Last Olympic Show Begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time.
He injured his back thigh in the early part of the season and was forced to miss the Jamaican Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I've been practicing well and that's the key thing," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included underdressed samba dancers and journalists turned fans.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a hundred meters, with which he smashed the world record and the contestants' confidence in spite of the final celebration, with a time of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career measured by a bell.
The world records of 9.58 in the 100 metres and 19.19 in the 200 metres, set in Berlin, are still valid today.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second undershoot, but no one but Bolt believes it will happen.
On the 100, Bolt's toughest contender is Athens 2004's 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single title in the finals, if he has made his way.
In Daegu 2011, Bolt missed the 100th World Cup final due to a fraudulent start.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games will be his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as his final finish line.
These are the Olympic Games that set me apart.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said in an interview with Sports Illustrated three months ago.
Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping test at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping test found traces of banned substances.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent home because he gave a doping test on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the Court of Appeals for Sport (CAS).
Xinhua reports that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspected doping cases have also been reported in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping test showing signs of the hormone epo.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio because of an anti-doping attack.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete during the test and had given a doping test on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Phelps won't be stopped by anything - historical gold came in show style
Michael Phelps of the United States, the most successful athlete in Olympic history, swam in the 200-meter mixed season for his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to win the same sport's Olympic gold medal in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Kosuke Hagino of Japan finished second in the mixed season before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have some fun," Helen Skelton, the BBC's Olympic swimming commentator, laughs in a quick interview with Iltalehti.
The article about Helen Skelton (right) made on Monday is one of the most read on the Iltalehti website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little bit of noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he emphasizes.
Skelton is dressed in high-heeled shoes and a short dress that is certainly at least revealing enough - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
There are no back steps, however.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
Skelton is sure to want to shock and perhaps even startle, but he insists he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
You're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine the noise reaching all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that focuses attention on how hard these swimmers work and how big of a sacrifice they make is okay for me," Skelton grinned.
You know what?
It's a fuss about nothing if it comes from (the host's) dress.
I'm a little amused if something like this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests for suspected terror attack
Rio police announced on Thursday that they have arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the safety monitoring of the games.
At the same time, police made five other arrests and questioned two people before their release.
All suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police back in July.
The detainees are believed to be linked to ISIS.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages urging violence had been circulated, among others, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blast suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their first-half Rio basketball tournament match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the public.
The police allowed the crowd in after they had controlledly blown up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have carried out a controlled detonation mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was able to enter after police had controlledly blown up the package.
The crowd did not make it to the stands by the start of the match because the police closed the arena for a while because of a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police blew up the package and only allowed the public into the hangar afterwards.
The drink awakened the Spanish team, which started the games drowsily.
Spain, which started with two losses, beat Nigeria by 96-87.
In the previous two races, Spain achieved silver.
Police conducted a controlled detonation mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious find was near a road cycling finish site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their early stages of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dame poked Petäjä-Siren - Finnish man ponders protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a rough patch on Thursday.
The Argentinean dame pounced on Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio for the opening start of Women's Surfing Day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete thought for a long time about the protest.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water in order to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rio.
The Finn was 27 when he left the crash.
Overall, London's 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
In terms of the tip, the crash had little effect.
Friday is an important day when there is a race starts 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 special things that science says will lengthen your life
Science has studied everything possible between heaven and earth.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is extended.
On the other hand, things that a person himself cannot control can bring him additional years.
These include a tendency to middle-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend your life.
You don't even have to splurge - just picking up a milk carton is enough.
The secret of longevity has been tried with many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest results of the study.
According to science, all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "reduced risk of death," especially for neurological or cardiac diseases.
Studies in favor of alcohol suggest that moderate consumption - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can extend a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gingivitis.
They, in turn, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study conducted in Norway examined how laughter affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to be alive at the end of the experiment.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is good for health according to many studies.
On top of that, it can also extend your life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years in their life, they must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings extra years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute solitude.
A University of Oxford study found that women with large buttocks had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether an Olympic medal-winning athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that longevity, on the other hand, is due to a person's social status - which, on the other hand, makes it possible to pursue recognitions such as the Nobel Prize, for example.
A study of shopping behavior among people over 65 found that a person who shopped daily was likely to live less often than a parent who shopped.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring earlier death.
So put the credit card out of your hand - online shopping therefore does not have the same effect.
Drunk driver derails into truck
On Friday evening, a serious frontal collision between a truck and a passenger car took place in Southwest Finland.
The accident took place in Koskentie, midway between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa when a passenger car that had been encountered had drifted into the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left standing in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car swerved into the ditch and from there over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The rescue service removed the injured driver from the car and transported him to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mille.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Mail sent loose candy to the wrong town
There were shortcomings in the K-Citymarket's bulk candy selection because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candies at Salo K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign caught her eye.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk sweets because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We will get more when Posti gets the load delivered!
Unless there was a traffic jam on the lawn, the sign said.
The merchant's foxy sign is related to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The cutting of grass is available at Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
I was blown away by the popularity of the update.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention given to this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia was able to catch her own favorites in a loose candy bag, even though a few cases were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for Posti's Transport Services business, apologized for the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do part-delivery (Saloon) with three, but only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all of her favourites in the selection.

Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss project already in 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and has gradually lost 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of her soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in appearance.
Backlund's before and after photo pair has garnered a number of complimentary comments from fellow dieters.
You're great.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one exclaims.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Let's Do It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I myself am on the same journey, another says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the Let's Do It Now project.
At the time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to normal weight, which was ten kilos away at the time.
Over the course of three months of fitness, the pounds eventually dropped by five.
The Wish of the Family of a Murdered Woman in Loviisa: Remembrance of the Victim for Police Dogs
A week ago, a family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered with a donation instead of flowers and petition for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Station and had also completed her nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous and unafraid of work.
Dear Friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update states that the entire donation money goes to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of the murder did not know the woman and had no connection to each other.
The murderer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was fatally wounded during the arrest.
Börje, however, survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Posti for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise a leased employee, estimates the Kanta-Häme District Court in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the withheld salary and €2,000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the ruling, Posti could have withheld only a part of the induction worker's salary that corresponded to the part of the induction worker's work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage, in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act, on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the Union of Postal and Logistics Union PAU's organizational decision on the introduction ban.
During the postal strike in November last year, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees will not familiarise themselves with temporary agency workers who break the strike.
This was first reported by People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights-respecting path
Turkey should return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Federation of Journalists.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Union of Journalists asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concerns for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini say that Finland has repeatedly brought to the attention of Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
Putin fired the head of his administration - replaced by Persecution of Estonian origin
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed Sergei Ivanov, the head of the presidential administration, the Kremlin says.
He will be replaced by Anton Vaino, grandson of Soviet Estonia's Communist leader Karl Vaino.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's tight-knit inner circle, will, according to the Kremlin's press release, take on special duties in the fields of environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be reassigned and proposed to replace Persecution, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era on KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to his position in 2011 before Putin's re-election as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition ban - not to be seen in Premier League opening
The world record holder for football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League kicks off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed with England.
Manchester United's acquisition of Paul Pogba is sidelined by the ban as ManU opens its league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid Italian club Juventus €105 million for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was placed under a ban from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and will be banned from one game.
That ban has been moved to England," the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In flow, megalomaniacism is a virtue
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festivalgoers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival's event area is stylized with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival, held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block festival to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind success is simple: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in event productions to think this way.
Often the goal is to reach the level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors by 5,000 last year.
This year, too, the festival will feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to finance things in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being steered in huge lanes.
We don't want that.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated to include 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurant points and drink bars.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year the venue will be a tent for 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's spirit.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even great visions are now possible in practice.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, operations were highly dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of about 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company that runs Flow was approximately six million euros.
It can also be used to produce "creative things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit in with Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is the punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge fan base in his genre, but he is not the most typical performer at a festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done damn good shows in recent years.
Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flowerpots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 injured in the attack.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists began leaving the bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, wildlife conservationist Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a telling picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said that a bomb had exploded by the bars.
It happened in one of the largest bar streets, said Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, two bombs exploded on the Finnish island of Phuket.
No one reportedly died.
At the same time, another twin bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials said there were likely rebel forces behind the bombings, who were not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken a keen interest in the activities of criminal organisations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness force goes into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not assigned to combat missions until several months after taking a military oath, says Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, Chief of Defence Training, who was interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combatable, for example, from conscripts serving 5.5 months in a war situation.
According to the head of training, the first order of duty is the reservists who are part of the readiness force.
No conscript or reservist is assigned to a task for which no required training has been given, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will begin training conscripts for the immediate readiness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations already during conscript training.
Pamela Tola Receives Giant Reimbursement for Homestead
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the transaction, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so a financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the District Court and the Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150,000.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the couple's court and settlement costs for a total of 47,344 euros.
The court moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when the apartment sale was made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the construction errors that had occurred were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a good home
Tola told the court of appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a good home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition, and that there was no harm from the items mentioned in the condition inspection report.
The condition inspection report mentioned the risks and drawbacks of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and meltwater running down the rock surface.
However, it did not appear from the discussions that this was a matter of any urgency.
Tola and Waroma remained under the impression that rainwater from the cliffs should perhaps be controlled a little over the next few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, was caused by both the rainwaters in the rock and the soil moisture rising capillary.
On the west side of the house, air contaminated with microbes could also enter the interior through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mold or yeast that allows health risk and exceeds the limit values was found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permits
The court also debated whether the apartment had been extended in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes to the apartment had been made in violation of the permit prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, mold problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, Tola and Waroma had no particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its ruling.
Creepy archive find: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for Nazis - register also Finns
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter that the National Archives of Maryland in the United States has recorded documents on microfilm involving a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch, and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the racial office in Nazi Germany.
The Bureau of Race operated under SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological examinations were performed on the women to find out.
The Bureau of Race examined women's backgrounds, for example, by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones to the Bureau of Race.
The Race Bureau wanted guarantees that women were "child-loving", "austere", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the standards were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
Lebensborn homes care for children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and supported having children.
The German Mother's Cross of Honour was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of Petäjä-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first start of the sailing Finnjollie day at the Rio Olympics, but was the tail of the whole group in the second start of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
Tuuli Petäjä-Siren fought in the RS:X class day starts at number 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded on a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of Finland's favourite artists for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the tango king of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää continues to buff and is currently in a frenzied uproar.
A book written by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer, Jari Sillanpää - Palajana, was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää talks about his life and career, both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to a total rush when he won the crown of tango king at the Tango Market in Seinäjoki in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed some different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted in a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and after only a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hungover!
Bridgehead reminisces in the book.
From the recording of the song, which has become a huge hit, one would not immediately guess that it was sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, it was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and top notch all the time.
Another incident involving one of the man's most popular songs, as described in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää broke up with her partner at the time and the case eventually ended up in the texts of You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book says that the song lyrics ordered from Saara Törmänen were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that tells a true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the breakup were not true, it was written based on a 7-day news story.
The newspaper reported that the reason for the breakup between Jari and his ex-lover was due to Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was complete nonsense and was not true.
Jari, according to the book, played furiously for the label and refused to sing the song, but ended up singing it anyway - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters supported the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls for the voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of remaining in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the distinction, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign, "It's the economy, stupid" flew into a slump in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic curly language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics outlines responses from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made the decision on non-economic grounds.
One of the economists' explanations for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand the economy.
Many people still have the illusion that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off to the real Britain.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economist, voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists did not come up enough.
They were particularly annoyed by the BBC's neutrality, which gave as much space to pro-EU economists representing only a couple of per cent of the economists as it did to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling us what the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letter combinations about the consequences of the separation are.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, then they were ignored because the economists represent an elite with whom, in their opinion, the voters have no common interests.
Economists such as big city academics would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy.
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, Immigrants crowd your hospital, Immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
The waiting room of every health center sees immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get doctor's appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they got rid of them?
There are foreigners living in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
Economists, however, failed to respond to them and if they did, their responses did not gain prominence.
Economists failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health center queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to Britain's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen real estate fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
According to him, preparations for Brexit were made in time in Aberdeen by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or the victory of a camp in favour of leaving the EU, began to be prepared for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have substantial liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went on to grow cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets," Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily quoted real estate fund that was affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
At the time, the fund was worth £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimated that the lowest amount of cash in these funds fell to ten percent or even less.
In other words, real estate funds prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds Closed Trade
When the pro-EU camp won, Europe went crazy.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together blundered the situation and brought the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball began to spin, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it too eventually had to freeze its trading for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close the store, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether the money is now worth pulling out in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because there would be losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew the notice.
Since then it has been fairly flat, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental European funds, for example.
However, there were a lot of queries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
In Vanhanen's opinion, the closures of real estate funds received undue attention.
Open funds, which were affected by the closures, control about 4% of British real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may be holding its funds until the end of 2017.
At the moment there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been raved down, but the situation does not look more "crazy" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities for some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar collector can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brings downs on London's real estate market
At 2 a.m., things didn't look too bad.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's where the word of strength came from.
I realized that this is now going to plan B," Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He immediately headed to work.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the early hours of the morning.
The TV screens, normally set silent at the office, were pounding the news, and the usually loud crowds were completely silenced to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the screens flashed nothing but red.
It was the kind of morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote, or midsummer.
The mood was mixed.
However, the company had prepared well for the alternative, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote starts correction movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went for an exchange.
The market began to anticipate sharp declines in the real estate market in Britain, and London in particular.
London's office space was predicted to have up to 20% downsides in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear, however, in Vanhanen's face that he spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is still too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the breakup will happen and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
Initial information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
CBRE, a real estate services company, provides about one-third of the market with information on price developments.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the City of London office buildings, the minus amounted to 6.1 per cent, Vanhanen lists.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're month-to-month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and there have only been worse figures in the past five months, Vanhanen says.
All equal falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared to Lehman's downfall and the global economic crisis that started in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite accurate, as this is a home-grown crisis in Britain.
The mood is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales like those times, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding can also be found normally.
The repair could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, he doesn't think the price-fixing movement is a miracle - it could have been there without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, real estate prices in London and other top cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced, Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have skyrocketed for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
The British economy has grown strongly, with London's population as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and an increasing number of institutions and even private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fueled by low interest rates, which has forced pension companies, for example, to look for income in new destinations.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom that preceded the 2008 crisis, according to Vanhanen.
Decentralize, Decentralize
Prices in London stabilized last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen also began to ease its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of reversal to be expected, and now it's here.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much of the future, but says that there is hardly any uptick in the way.
The mood indicates that there is a falling or even going on ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim.
If it is decentralized, the risks are decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group starts to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the retail group announced today that it will start collecting more accurate information about its regular customers' purchases.
Once data has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will start collecting it in early May for the purchased products as well.
S Group is following Kesko here, as data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, Managing Director of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing on a licensed basis.
The most effective channel is email.
Quite a few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to the change in S Group's registration.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to food purchases alone.
The rating is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and no such program is currently planned.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own loyalty program Ykkösbonus, which can be joined in Valintatalo, Siwa and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect product- or product-level data, we stay at the total amount of the receipt.
That is, we know in which store the purchases were made and on what day, as well as the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as K Group or S Group, says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
According to him, the loyalty program is to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially an experiment
SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively extensive until now.
In addition to personal data and address information, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, as well as children's birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same household and their roles are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment have been recorded for the S-Front Card purchase.
In addition, information about S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
In contrast, data in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, there have been hopes from customers that marketing could be targeted more accurately, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in cashiers anyway, whether you like it or not.
A willing person can check their stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, cash registers cannot access the data, Saarikoski emphasises.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog confirmation - puppy becomes first explosive dog
A black Labrador retriever puppy sniffs energetically five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing with his favorite toy.
The box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of shells that smelled of gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and e-commerce main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace because the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures at Customs, and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Senior Inspector Mikko Grönberg from Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosives dog for Customs' duties are mail shipments through Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail items pass through the airport each year, among which may be weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made around 300 finds related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors from online shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will examine checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Finnish Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also attends training with Heila at the experts of the police and the Defence Forces.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, Customs decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always further trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for choosing a dog for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close colleague of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders get to Heila from a one-time cap.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the cover of the camera mic to the fast dog, but Heila returns the cover that looks like a soft toy immediately at the "loose" command.
Tough competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding work tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog wearing a work vest, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is about 60000-70000 euros per year for customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active portions only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There is a strong competition for working dogs in Customs.
Approximately 20-30 Customs employees applied for ownership of Heila.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience with dogs and supervision duties at Customs.
Mini nation gets its first Olympic medal - people get a day off
The Olympic gold medal in rugby in Fiji, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the matter after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team's return home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was watching the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been set up in the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheer," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded on his last attempt from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening quality as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kg for the push and 145 kg for the stunt.
His total was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his thrust in the last 175 kg, as did his other.
On the third attempt, the weights rose with a fierce roar.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Football Club, which plays in the men's football league, has made a long-term contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player for our team, who has power and has a small threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, where he scored 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemi residents will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker when last season's goalie Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
Defiant Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has become well-known as Alex Dunphy in the Modern Family comedy series, once again flaunts her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behavior to a much bolder one.
The star has posed on social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scantily dressed.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently released several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television most of his life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood," Palmer says to Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has angered some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she will be in ten years, when the downswing is already so hard," a woman on Winter's Instagram says.
Some of the female fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her to ignore the criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You're an inspiration to many women," exclaims the young woman.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured by the Northern Lights: In the autumn it is possible to see a fairy-tale mirror aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their aurora trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a press release.
The main destinations for Japanese auroral tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly associated with the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
There is great demand for winter northern lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season begins early in the autumn and continues well into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision a fairy tale, says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would miss clearer unique sights in Finland, and here the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in the other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros per day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fidi's masterclass leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament plummeted to the final challenge put forward by Fiji in the Thursday night finals when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a master class in handling, biting, dodging, supporting, running lines and sheer force as they won their first Olympic medal.
The defeat came with a reasonable consolation for the silver medal - Britain's third of the day - and they were proud of their hard work in the Olympic rugby starting tournament, where they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A hard 7-5 victory over South Africa in the semi-finals earlier that day may have plagued them in the finals.
But even in this condition, Fidi would have won a top-of-the-line team of 15.
The UK may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one Brit has a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fidi's head coach is Ben Ryan, England's former boss from Wimbledon.
Britain's journey has been quite a one.
Eight years ago, they, coached by Ryan, lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi started off excellently, battling UK tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running into a bus, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the end zone in a corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai's second touchdown on the right led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped male-mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but that was only a drag for Fidi.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua scored in the right corner, and Great Britain were down 17-0.
Nakarawa scored again from a new start, and the clock still had more than a minute left...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou dashed through the UK for loose tackles and rushed to the line to score.
After the goal kick, the score for the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that's exactly what it is.
Great Britain made a series of changes during the break that blocked Fidi's dam...for a total of four minutes, which was fine compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pass game.
Dan Norton scored for Great Britain while scoring a touchdown in the left corner and narrowing the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Seas islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fidi's exhilarating approach.
Mata Viliame with his last-minute goal was frosting in Fidi's cake, which did not need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fijians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and Great Britain beat South Africa in the tight semi-finals, where each scored one goal - Britain's goal kick decided the game.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A mighty late tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of England's 15-side rugby team, secured the victory and finally a silver medal.
Coach's battle with cancer brought Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to rowing victory
There will be no gold more emotionally stirring in these games, and that really means something.
From the first draft to the last, 220 hard drives towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they rowed alone, there were three voices on the boat, and the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time as the two raced their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's pairing - the first women in the history books of British sports to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes gliding on the surface with the grace of a swan, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every rowing gold is a group of helpful pairs of hands that gradually advance the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago after being diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to this day.
As he said, the situation was narrow.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
It changes your mindset a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky enough to be able to start their treatment at the beginning of 2014 outside of the season, when they caused as little disruption as possible - if that phrase can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but that makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, the first thought of the couple was that of Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment during the Afghan deployment, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so he deserves a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The pair set a tough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even in the last 500 metres, as the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very caught up in an instant.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good row and winning the race, and we did.
The couple waits a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was going to be my last race.
It would have put too much pressure.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," he said.
Iceland to replace Panama-leaked government
Iceland is holding an early parliamentary election in October, which protesters enraged by the Panama leaks are calling for as early as spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians evaded taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
Election day has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's rage last spring will affect the outcome of the autumn election.
In the June presidential election, criticism of those in power was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recanted his latest rant.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that incumbent President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in its creation.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be Commander-in-Chief of the Army who can sink that low," Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned wearing Muslim-favored covert burkini swimwear on beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that going to beaches and swimming is forbidden to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are highly suggestive of religious affiliations, may increase the risk of disorderly conduct in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two extremists linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the Oulu region's bathing waters passed the sieve - Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-algae opacity has been observed in Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, Oulu Region Environmental Services took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the action limits set by the Decrees of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations in the Meriniemi bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae clouding observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet render the water unwieldy, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae bloom, creating blue-green algae mass as rafts on the water surface.
The environmental action will monitor the situation by means of more frequent inspections.
If blue-algae blooms become blue-algae blooms, this will also be announced separately on the bathing area notice board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen on forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed in the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on a generational change of forest space.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational renewals of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income from forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote generational renewals of forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests at the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds criticism in the tax amendment proposal.
Forest gift reduction is proposed to be done from the forest owner's pure capital income.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
According to MTK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry assumes that by making a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry, the loss of the capital income of forestry would be prevented on the basis of it, which would be deducted in other taxation.
Such a person would receive the tax benefit even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, according to him, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the yield value of the forest is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It has been pulled too high, according to Hakkarainen.
As such, it eliminates 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners from the scope of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forest owner base, he says.
In the VM, it is considered that the boundary ensures the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been carried out in forest policy for decades.
It is based on the aging of the forest owner base.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
A powerful hailstorm surprised motorists on the Himanga - two cars swerved into a ditch and crashed into each other
There was a special chase in the Himanga of Kalajoki on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that drove in a row went into a ditch, after which the one in the rear crashed into the one that drove in front.
According to Harri Pyyhtiä, the on-call firemaster, the derailment in the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong hailstorm.
There were two people in the back car, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the previous car was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometres to the River Kalajoki.
Finnish research may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to correspond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of drug treatments for cancer by focusing on not only cancer cells, but also the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue.
The research results were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home murder threshing continues at court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for second perpetrator as well
The threshing of the Muhos family home killing continues at the court for both convicts.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the family home killing in Muhos.
The other received 8 years and 4 months for, among other things, killing and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The second is sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of seriously endangering traffic safety as a young person and transporting a vehicle without a right as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs, and the man who received a harsher sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has received a lesser sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder committed as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time.
According to the district court, the 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as a child protection unit director at a school in July last year.
The 17-year-old, convicted of murder, allegedly attacked the director sitting on the living room couch from behind.
The director had let go of the grip and led the young person to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a state of mind study, both of the convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the court, the young people had been planning to escape from the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, increasing only at 156 years of age
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed to be an ice shark, according to a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, the holker can live up to 400 years.
The female does not reproduce until she is 156 years old.
The lifespan of the ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows by only one centimeter per year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive ice sharks.
Scientists discovered the age by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear testing in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although a throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a financial sage - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
As much as a third of the state's total tax revenue would be lost if Donald Trump's push for a change in corporate tax were implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, especially with tax breaks benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
A truly staggering sum of $1,000 billion a year would be left uncollected.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's proposed discount of 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Trump accused the state of over-regulating business and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The decided environmental standards of haste must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must appoint "experts rather than bureaucrats".
"Destructive" trade policy is one of the main causes of U.S. problems, according to Trump.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico would be subject to a penalty tax of 35%.
We offer a new future.
"Americanism, not globalism, is our creed," Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive in the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his manners, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists -- including those close to Republicans -- see Trump's program take the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
A surge from the past - People's News
The sea is tumbling fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes amidst Madrid's street hustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novel.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, Travel Lovers (2013), was a bit of a fun and turbulent satirical comedy, the pre-Skin where I live (2011) among the best of the Spanish squire's career.
On a level, Julieta (2016) takes place somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama centered on the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen largely as a long flashback.
Life seems to be on track for a middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, the new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed right up to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta recounts the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He begins with the time before the daughter was born, the moments when he met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, also stars in the second female lead, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between the Stitches (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a lump, but I'd say with a bit of a twist and a bit of a one-time sweep.
There is a fair distance in Julieta to the flashiness that is often so characteristic of Almodóvar films, down to the humor.
It is an evenly acted, restrained, place in places with good music and quite melancholy film with elements of elegy as such.
On the other hand, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still there, and in such a way that it starts to stick in the eye more as a pure technicality than as a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, death, or otherwise only by sudden losses, but the surface remains equally korea.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of the title character, the costumes change from scene to scene, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main thing, or the tunings of the scene, does not improve particularly from this.
When repeated mechanically, the impression is external and a bit lifeless.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three short stories by Nobel Prize-winning Canadian author Alice Munro.
The short stories have been published in Karkulainen: Narratives.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly uniform literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably stronger drama, that much of the big stuff - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the movie deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premiere is 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers keep saying, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be made by a raft of cuts.
There will be no further cuts.
The already decided savings of four billion will be enough.
This is confirmed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) under the budget session.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
The child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index will be cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 days to 400.
Education cuts continue.
The municipals are haunted
Why are the ministers so keen to stress the fact that no further cuts will be made on top of these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the parliamentary term, not the polls.
In the past, it has been seen that the municipal election result, which takes government parties in different directions, spoils the mood of the government for a long time.
However, Gallupit reports that the party of the government of Finland expects a ruckus defeat, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the True Finns received 752 new councillors, much of whom will realise the price of influencing in the right-wing government next spring.
The lifeline of the three governments of roughly equal parties rests on the fact that the Finns Party can stand.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party already had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's fermenting state have also surfaced.
There will be no new cuts -rhetoric, firstly, to obscure the fact that next year they will be made violently and secondly to try to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set a target of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take on EUR 5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is not able to follow its own programme: indebtedness does not fold and does not even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
That means even tougher cuts on top of the old ones in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections will take over what is to come.
With these measures, the indebtedness will not be reversed
It is quite clear that with the current measures, indebtedness will not fold, even if Juha Sipilä tries to stir up a positive mood.
The graphs presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it beyond question:
Forecasts of global economic growth have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, meaning that there will be no pull from the international economy.
Finland's national economy has barely risen since the collapse experienced in 2008, except during the stimulus policy that was implemented temporarily at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion more per year than in 2008.
On the graphs presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
The debt stimulus proposed by the Left Alliance in spring 2015 was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, maintaining unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the view of the Centre Party, the National Coalition Party and the Finns Party on what is responsible.
Survey: Wanting to leave a lot of tasks to municipalities
Three out of four feel that organising day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also places responsibility on individual municipalities for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, the province is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the tasks that are the responsibility of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
An underage drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie at half past one on Friday night.
A police patrol attempted to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man set out to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanranta Road, from where to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but a faster-footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
A breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
Among other things, the case is being investigated as an aggravated endangerment of traffic safety.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch.
A truck loaded with stone fell into a ditch in Kulvijärvi on Kaavintie at 9.15 p.m. on Thursday evening.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a curved turn to the left and had fallen into a ditch on its side.
Rescue services lifted the injured driver out of the crashed truck through the overhead door, along with rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
A fallen truck spilled hydraulic oil on the road, which was sucked into the peat by the rescue services.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are searching for a woman, about 5'2" tall, slender and well-groomed, with white hair under her chin.
Observations and hints of the missing person's movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre's hotline number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The downdraft that knocked down the tents at the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pippuri, chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will get on its feet financially, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the marketplace at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 pm to 3 pm.
The program will be organized as planned.
A surge flow occurs in a thundercloud when rainwater and its weight initiate a descending airflow.
Changes in the water state of the thundercloud bind heat, and thus the falling air mass cools and its rate towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several surges in Finland during the summer.
The path of the surge currents is difficult to predict.
The surge hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where Parafest took place, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell to the ground, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly injured.
Among them was one child who was transported with a slight injury for further treatment.
Air Pollution Aging Londoners
According to the study, Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The cause of skin ageing is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
British skin care company Caci analyzed London's air's most toxic fine particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirees in London is two and a half years older than, say, a peer living in rural areas.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution that comes from traffic fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners every year.
Studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac's study found that early aging is a risk, especially for those Londoners who commute on foot near congested streets.
Londoners may try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed - pushed the man in front
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to transport him to the central hospital for further examination, seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain further, as it collided with the rocks in front.
Riento with new powers for the upcoming season
Joensuulainen Liiga-Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will go into the series starting in October from a better starting point than in memory.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tone is definitely better found than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as head coach of Rienno, praises the new team as entrepreneurial and cohesive.
From the foreign trio, Fred Musoni begins his second season at Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwandan national team, is a 205-centimeter wood chipper.
Garchet is a passer, the Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Cups since 2003.
Now Tampere is in its sixth race, only 2013 missed out on Canada being better at North American qualifiers.
I was in Turku working and playing with the women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was establishing a national floorball team.
I got interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the SM level as a floor bandy.
Sähly was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the Finnish Floorball Championship in 1991-92 with the university, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the club's A-girls to the championship.
Women's SM-series career culminated in silver 1995.
In all, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM-series, the balance amounted to 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
The Joensuu based floorball club Josba was raised by Perttu Puska and the uncle-based Tatu Väänänen was selected to join the Finnish national team, which will play in the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, the attacking 25-year-old Perttu Puska has played six men's national games before this, where he has accumulated a total power score of 9+4=13.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from the thigh pain and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran of the Seinäjoki brothers, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Championship last December.
The head coach of the Finnish Floorball Team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleybender Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after this season.
The Finnish Beach volleyball championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals will be played in both adult and adolescent leagues.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the top six pairs in each league's ranking will be qualified for the final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was raised by Elimäen YMCA and has been a member of the Finnish beach volley for several years.
Now living in Helsinki, Hasu is looking forward to the games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to attend the weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to the baseball stadium.
I haven't played in adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu says.
The Kouvola region ignited Hasu's spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
Childhood has a lot of memories in mind.
I started volleyball when I was 9 years old in the E-girls of the Elimäen YMCA.
At the top of the head is an oversized jersey, knee pads revolving around the ankles, and huge aces and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment that was comfortable to play in.
All the families were heavily involved - the teammate's father coached us and our mother was the club's president for a long time.
For Essi Hasu, beach volleyball was already a natural choice for indoor volleyball as a counterweight during his junior years.
The swimming pool has been playing bibs since the 1990s.
The action has always been active.
I also went to see the junior SM-tour competitions myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkinen in the Finnish Championship finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-honey, we're still missing the trophy cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
A weekend performance in Kouvola may be the last one for Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges await in the field of civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the flip-flops will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The crash flow knocked down tents at a disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
The surge brought down three tents at Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to Karjalainen, the tents had a total of about 200 people.
There was a show going on in one of the larger tents.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident occurred at 5 p.m. on Friday.
Markus Viitaniemi, an on-duty firefighter interviewed by Karjalainen, tells the newspaper that the situation had the ingredients for a major accident.
According to the newspaper, the continuation of the event is at stake.

Salomon Koli boldly left to become an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he also believes in a positive future in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with her younger brother Valtteri Koli, started working as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting out as a rural entrepreneur meant taking on debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come in the hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always loved to go to the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I have put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank wasn't enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself was really brave enough to get involved in the project and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything is going to be fine.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected in the top ten in the Young Food Producer competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria announces inflation for first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (since June 2012) and the first figure above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the Cost-of-living Index, was -0.8% in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016), when compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household items and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect criticized as an Asian caricature
According to Snapchat, the anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat allows its approximately 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with their identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, facial twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticized for claiming that the app promotes a blackface mask or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So when Snapchat advertised a lens to some users this week that gave them slanted eyes, slanted teeth, and chubby cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "yellowface," or yellowface.
And they wonder if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company's bigger problem with diversity.
News and disapproval spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant as a tribute to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But for observers who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others vehemently denied the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about photos was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable."
He added that "it's hard to argue with a comparison that has an outrageous Asian caricature side by side and filter effects."
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to the ultimate demeanor.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trappings.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people who are more racially diverse than their parents can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image of the user, "it's much harder for these guys to be discreet than before."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing for Medium and in a telephone interview, he said he believes that racial disputes reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male management and ended his writing with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"Either they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colors on their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions like this," Chinese-American Zhu said, "or they have representatives of different skin colors at work, but they're not in positions where they feel safe or could speak out."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely ignored.
The company does not disclose figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial backgrounds of its staff, but a spokesperson said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and push forward internal inclusion efforts.
For his part, Zhu said he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not okay."
Congressional panel says military officials misrepresented ISIS intelligence
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said authorities at the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces War Area modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than was justified by the events on the ground.
An interim report by a working group set up by the House Defense Committee, the Republican Chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread dissatisfaction" among headquarters intelligence analysts who said their estimates of American efforts to defeat ISIS were rigged by superiors.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Armed Forces Warfare District in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs approved by higher-ranking Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than was justified by the facts on the ground. They were consistently more positive than analyses produced by other elements of the intelligence community," the report's press release said.
"The events at Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican in California, said.
Centcom's management failures reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persistent problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
While it does not provide clear evidence that reports were ordered to be tampered with by senior Obama administration officials, it does describe how analysts felt as if Centcom leaders put pressure on them to portray the threat posed by the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters' press releases, statements and testimonies to Congress were far more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major attack to recapture Mosul could even begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders at the U.S. Armed Forces War Area headquarters manipulated the headquarters' intelligence output to downplay ISIS's threat in Iraq.
Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, is followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Department of Defense Superintendent has opened an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, in agreement with some of the Republican working group's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a redundant isolated process from the intelligence assessment of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's chief Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the release of intelligence outputs," worsened the mood among analysts, and "did not give enough room for divergent perspectives."
Schiff and Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to fit their conclusions into "a pre-set or political narrative."
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's Chief Superintendent has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the Inspector General's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential subjects of national security."
The investigation has repercussions beyond just the question of whether US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defense officials now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the HQ to provide honest assessments of the military actions of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects the controversy of more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article that said that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small military force in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the implications of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion over Islamic state intelligence.
According to officials, last year Hooker's group concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
However, The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The then-Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many lawmakers viewed his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in women's field hockey, staging a showdown with Britain
The day after scoring three goals as the team beat Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored the first two goals of the U.S. women's field hockey team on Thursday as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But here's what he knows: The Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, who were still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarter-finals, and this game will determine who will finish first and who will finish second in their six-team group.
The first-place finisher avoids a strong Holland, the leader of the second group, for a little longer at the start of the quarterfinals.
No matter how Saturday's game ends, the Americans have stirred controversy with their surprising success here, four years after they were last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel) to join the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
He was not included in the 2008 Olympics because he was not included in the final player list.
In 2012, nothing worked out for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We did not have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We've made a turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half scoring with a backhand close to the goal.
India had come into the game with no wins in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score at 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then toured the center and yanked the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal midway through the fourth period.
This zero game was the tournament's first for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had conceded one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The Peace of Trampoline in the midst of the Olympic Frenzy
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable message of fierce competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton passed from the archer to the swimmer and from the gymnast to the triathlete.
It is impossible to turn on a television, read a newspaper, or listen to a conversation in a coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-timer and future heartbreaker with the dimples, could well be one of the names known to everyone, who is presented at prime time and supported by sponsorship deals and good-humored TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes in the Olympic gold trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all species equally.
Further away from the center, in part in the shade, are those species that are not generally accepted by everyone: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke, long live it.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its first appearance at the Sydney Games, there are so few observations of its presence over the past 16 years that many I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete did not advance to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men's, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals.
However, there is a certain underdog charm associated with the trampoline, partly because to the uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I must confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
There are opportunities for amusement in the sport, as is noticed by the endless bounces in the cartoons, but it also has the grace of gymnastics and swimming, two species that it basically combines.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish el trampolin, which means springboard.
On a giant trampoline, the champions jump up to nearly 30 feet in height, and must perform spinning sets of movements (turns, folds, and flips) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated on the basis of execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Rio has 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women competing.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
Those hoping for a medal must go further, faster, up and over in their quest for gold - sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They not only hunt for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, for another grotesque frontier: a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatical - and can even bring the viewer to tears.
But that's also why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers a moment of rest from this.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to a new ascent, appearing weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no furious rush towards the end, no jumps into the distance, only a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It is as close to Zen status as can be reached at the Olympics.
The women's qualifying competitions and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 1 p.m. (ET), the men's competitions will also take place on Saturday at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon repertoire starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticed in the general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as suggested by male gymnasts in the United States some time ago, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
'Generation protests' in Ethiopia, longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia breaking down?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country as it spread to more and more areas.
Thousands of people stormed the streets alone last week, calling for a radical political change.
Human rights groups said the government's response was relentless.
Witnesses said dozens of unarmed protesters were shot and killed by police.
Spreading videos recorded at demonstrations, believed to be from late last year or early this year, show security officials hitting young people with sticks while being forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The United Nations' main human rights authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and in the future it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved immensely, and the capital Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about government repression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen," Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia, said.
All the youth are demonstrating.
One generation is demonstrating.
The complaints are diverse and cover everything from land use to the stranglehold of the ruling coalition.
After last year's much-criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now holds all seats in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of submerging, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first one seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate the location through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, get along better.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business, taking advantage of the oromos, many of whom are Muslim and who live in the lowlands.
But this, too, is changing.
"We are on our way to organizing under one umbrella," Oromo leader Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest protests have been in the Amharic and Oromo areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, who cover about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and use secret envoys to make opponents harmless.
"The current regime has no such basic instinct," conflict analyst Abdi said.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the Tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil was in 2005, when thousands protested the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been botched by the government first and then looted by them.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters died, though less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the country's internal escalation of contempt for the Ethiopian government.
And now it is beginning to take on a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the amhara city of Gondar attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and anti-Tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say that the demonstrations put the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, even though it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, they also do not want their already unstable allies to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balancing act."
Donald Trump Explains His Obama-Based ISIS Claims as "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quell the controversy over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming he wasn't serious when he repeatedly insisted this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The investigation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have struggled to defend him during a turbulent period, in an awkward position where they have to explain remarks that he does not necessarily mean.
Following an insinuation at Wednesday night's campaign meeting, Trump increasingly claimed the same in Thursday's interviews, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created ISIS.
However, in an early Friday morning tweet, Trump said he was just being sarcastic.
The release was a turnaround from the day before when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soothe his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took it into his hearing ears.
The latest criticism storm comes in a situation where Trump has sought to refocus his campaign amid declining opinion poll results.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Fleeing Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses in the past.
Late in July, after he faced widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I guess I'm being sarcastic."
The approach allows Trump to go to the limits of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then 'clears' one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is sly about his statements and knows they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of tempering his speeches for a large voting audience, Trump has been even more sacrilegious in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed that Trump lags behind Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump tends to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny over the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization he called an amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, where Clinton worked as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to get worse because it failed to effectively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack news media outlets that go on about his every word and are biased against him.
He taunted "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to figure him out by saying "They won't make it!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's excuse as new evidence that he was unfit for president.
Previous Closed Cafe Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have a wireless network but provided good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the street side of Bedford Avenue became too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cup cake shaped soaps.
It was mourned by locals as the latest loss in a middle-class renovating town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is overwhelmed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and have the same unsophisticated atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new Verb is run by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in the Verb in 2001, and was there until the end.
When a client offered to fund him in a new location, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought an espresso machine of the same design.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon-egg-cheese sandwiches, and the tops are served with capers and browned onions, for example.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but it makes fresh juices.
Over the course of nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many former customers as well," he said.
One last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one such client.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he wandered into a coffee shop.
He says that after Verb closed, he gave up drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a blended chai drink instead of his usual iced coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-time client, Tom Rosenthal, visited the Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to work there and always placed the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were making my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes, for variety, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against the soap store that took over the old facilities.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for the Verb, using the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take up the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it up soon at some point to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-dried coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and said it was inconsolable when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt as if he had come home when he walked in and ordered a coffee.
"I wanted to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: The Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to have lunch in his office.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods, such as foie gras pâté, and Maryland swamp turtle soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman was about life from the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper will release on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Showing some sort of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a reporter at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unsophisticated lunch bar in the Flatiron area that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese-olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving with turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating during the depression.
"The mourners were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut butterloaf, liver butterloaf, bean butterloaf.
They were made from an ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued to be the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe scoffed.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, American tables, especially in the countryside, were like a eat-as-much-as-tough buffet.
Women's groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At the time, food became a central, distressing topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, low-cost diet: Mystery foods such as crumbs and boxes became the main foods, and the box was "a great way to use leftovers," mentioned Ziegelman, because chefs were able to hide the less appealing ingredients under a creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been at the heart of American meals for years, became a sparingly dosed luxury product.
Special compilations were tried, with calorie intake and nutrient content being more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While also doing research for a book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era dish in which fried onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman stated, "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter fits into fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or since.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgeters" and meet the challenge of converting blobs like mashed spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic treats.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let Me Eat a Cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gilded dining room wearing a tuxedo.
He was amazingly out of it all.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As reported in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "offered not only one of Washington's most dreary, but also the worst-prepared food."
Many of the diets during the depression were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when they wrote the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she couldn't throw food away.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind-hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that a common trick was to give modest recipes a showy name.
The dessert had no whipped cream, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All reluctantly immersed their spoons in a sticky, brown paste.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe sang once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little chopped walnuts might help."
Gilead to be reimbursed for legal fees in hepatitis C patent battle against Merck
The U.S. District Judge has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc. be entitled to the attorney's fees it incurred in a dispute over a hepatitis C patient against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted of $200 million in fees for violating two of Merck's patents relating to Gilead's successful drugs Sovald and Harvoni, a release that followed when a U.S. judge discovered Merck's abuses, including perjury and other unethical practices.
In a verdict filed Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to relief from the damages it incurred in opposing the suit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The lawsuit dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir, the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed forces say they have taken full control of ISIS-controlled Manbij
U.S.-backed forces have completely captured the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had freed more than 2,000 civilian-lipper prisoners held as prisoners by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's ally force, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to explore it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paying 34.2% in federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his or her spouse that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, primarily the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speaker fees, and the former Secretary of State announced that he had received $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for his book about his career at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published a 10-year tax return.
Their actual federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for economic transparency," Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retracts his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not obligate them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed for an audit of the IRS as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter as he posted a link to the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business, and numerous other ties to countries such as Russia.
Clinton has addressed the problem by posting an online video on Friday that featured prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last few decades has done: publish his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that there has been no or very little tax paid by Trump in the two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted numerous tax attorneys and accountants on Friday who said the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in presidential elections.
Clinton has backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year would pay at least 30% in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is undergoing an audit by the IRS, and that Trump is not "afraid" of the tax-collecting agency, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, had an actual federal tax rate of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment target was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers boost Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements - they throw animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, in collaboration with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...tools, we have seen a shift in attitudes in these communities, where they are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing a penetrating elephant with a flashlight and playing a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth, as well as a firecracker, after which the condom is wound so that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is ignited, it bursts into flames and bursts the chili powder dust into the air.
One scent is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a trigger that fires a Roman candle into the air, and the fireworks produce a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel that removed Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin unleashed a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, who made the documentary about the Holocaust, vented his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of countries area codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the states that you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
While searching for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the response from there "shocked him".
The hotel's prescriptionist said it was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the decision caused even more outrage in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel's area code," an employee reportedly said, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, calls the incident a "great injustice," Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
That in itself is a great injustice.
But even more shameful is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident generated quite a backlash online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gave in" to the claims of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another publication, noting that a hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called the incident "inattention" and "apologies" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A clear command not to include Israel in the short-list was never made," Kempinski's spokesman reportedly said, according to the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students demonstrating
On Thursday, students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as students gathered to demonstrate against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to disperse a group of students, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
Sao Paolo state governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin suggested that just under 100 public schools would be closed, and 300,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place just days after the protesters set out as a group to support the deposed President Dilma Rousseff as the country's Senate voted to impeach him.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran grows at a sudden rate of 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown great interest in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally, one of the main goals of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, totaling $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to $158 million.
"The growth in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's foreign delegation in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It must be safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner hit the finish line as the British captured cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner excelled in the men's team sprint at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night as the UK team's trio defended their title from London in 2012.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy excelled, a legend proud of the youngster as he raced to the finish line, catching the winning favourite from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after modestly finishing sixth at the March World Track Championships in London, although Hoy has since finished his racing career.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of the special broadcaster Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's termination also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man that the British coaches held on to in relation to the Scots potential that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team to lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy shift was a big part of the makeover, and it included driving the Hindes in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on the BBC, drawing the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
23-year-old Skinner of Glasgow said, "Comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the World Champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later retracted his comment, and the British rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with the overwhelming win.
Hindes said, "It felt like being in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply fantastic.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten cycling disciplines in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are looking forward to a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's demonstrated fitness, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold medals in one Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (on that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have the total number of medals in six golds and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny next competes in a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
It is won with friends.
Winning alone is, to be honest, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the rank of knight."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were among the fastest in the qualifying four-man, four-mile team pursuit.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will take place today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins is sure to be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time trial when officials invited him for a length measurement.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald advanced in world record time as the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The British team has come to trust that its mighty track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and reach a whole host of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been downplayed before the Rio Games.
There has been some drama behind it, the least of which has been the resignation of technical director, Shane Sutton, in April on charges of sexism and temptation, and the end of a career of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's races at the biking stadium, it seems that Britain's now legendary reputation to reach its peak at the perfect moment could once again hold true.
Portland smelter's future questionable due to power contract cut
The future of Portland's Victorian aluminum smelter, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain as the power company distributing electricity to the plant revealed that one of the factory owners is about to terminate the distribution contract, so a cut in all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to extend the subsidies required to keep the plant running.
The 20-year subsidy period ends in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of the plant's closure.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland smelter is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which started as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the factory's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminum smelter at its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it also expects the other three owners to terminate their contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina Group, and the smaller stakes are owned by CITIC, a Chinese company, and Marubeni Corp, a Japanese company.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means that the meltless physical electricity demand will continue," it said.
According to the AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which were supposed to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a 12 month notice period, so they will effectively expire in 2017.
"For that reason, AGL expects the contracts to bear fruit in fiscal year 2017," the electricity company said.
All potential profit impacts for AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for the wholesale electricity price futures market.
The AGL said it has already "anticipated termination" by reducing the value of contracts in its bookkeeping by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "will not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the smelter operational or secure the electricity supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the deal was supposed to come into effect in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the deal.
Analysts have been wary not only of the Portland smelter in Victoria, but also of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants exit the market, it will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us as an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just a Kardashian reality TV star, is on the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and the fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and was a model at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of dear people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover announcement was followed by a quirky (or perhaps just Kardashian-style?), scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot their sister's cover, but which ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's a cliché plot pattern of almost every "birthday episode" in the children's television series (Seacrest recites the lines "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of a bunny-juss drawn in the morning), but Kris had to get her other girls to somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered a new Kardashian era with the September Vogue slot.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made the cover of Vogue first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the highest-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee record than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that 615 of last year's 832-page opus were advertising content).
The unveiling of its cover star is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more "celebrities who act as models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it should happen that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "success model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she is in fairly good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or today's young people who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner has all of this).
They are justifiably talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyoncé has been one of the strongest years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
This feeling resurfaced with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But spinning around in discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's foundation.
She and all her sisters sell you photos of themselves in their own apps, found behind a paywall.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister Kourtney and her children, she is a reality TV star.
160,000 people are turned away each year by the Community Legal Centres
More than 160,000 of the nation's most vulnerable are turned away each year from the Community's legal centres as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already-extremist activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those without opportunities to fight unfair evictions and the like - are already turned away as they seek free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the limits of the community are preparing for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centers are set to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres calculation report, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision was not reversed, the situation would only get worse.
"The legal centers of the Queensland community are chronically underfunded, meaning that every year thousands of people are turned away from essential services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships with unmanageable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly segregated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, meaning that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents will be forced to navigate amid complex legal problems without assistance.
We appeal to both the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need to deal with their legal problems.
Last year, the state government delivered on its promise to raise funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their client communities, and the Palaszczuk government should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign sued after employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly not doing anything after they were told that the campaign's North Carolina operations chief was gunning down an employee in February while they were driving in the Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software trainee Vincent Bordin in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he waited for months for the situation to be dealt with internally before realizing "it wouldn't happen."
Chief Earl Phillip "took out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the barrel against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the suit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause harm," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told an audience in North Carolina that "second-repudiation people" — usually understood as gun owners and gun enthusiasts — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and allowed to elect judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context, and that he does not support violence.
Bordin's challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault, and emotional upset.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not respond to the request for comment immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The callback from his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and flourishing throughout the stomach, not just to local communities and across London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 Games, as we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10,000 new internships and 40,000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone, as well as eliminating youth unemployment around the airport.
As well as before the London 2012 Games, some come to think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games, and that we would be put to shame before the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and £211 billion in economic growth, as well as leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented an infrastructure investment programme of £11 billion on time and on budget: the T5, voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, the T2, built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement a third runway backed by £16 billion of private money.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will be one as well.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of Commerce for the Treasury.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse play for blocking ads
For companies that get money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the ad-blocking program are a "cat-and-mouse game," said one of the companies that makes such a program.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its computer-accessible pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post that said users could update the program's filters to block ads again on social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said its website's code will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's circumvented the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokeswoman Ben Williams wrote that "such a round-the-clock battle between the open-source ad blocking community and its travelers has been going on since ad blocking was invented," and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the battle is a strong indication of how much grief ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This is nearly four times the number that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is on the hunt for ad blockers on computer-enabled pages, as mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for a social network or Instagram, the spokesperson said.
Computer ads still bring in enough revenue to make Facebook consider this type of action worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it was updating its "ad preference" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that the new filters on Adblock were worrying because they would also block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we have instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car on Swiss freeway apparently for suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the freeway in the early hours of Thursday in a case that was apparently a suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and laid down in the dark on a road where she was hit by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill herself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, police said, appealing to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a "logical" step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the involved drivers will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecution to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases — both of which involved a person walking in the dark on the freeway — it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the paper said.
Last year, police were acquitted of negligent manslaughter after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police, who were responding to the 911 call, were driving in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a totally exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surfaces and carbon dioxide-filled atmospheres, could ever have had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were probably areas of the planet that were drier than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to enable life and protect against rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 percent dimmer sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its day-to-day appearance to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface from much of the sun's heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than Earth's current ones.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was probably habitable at one time, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned under ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with deadly greenhouse gases - Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venusian climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday from the Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey, citing the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process as the reason.
Colorado VP/CEO Joe Sakic confirmed the news and mentioned that the team will begin searching for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty as vice president of hockey affairs and head coach at the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I have thought long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order for this to be achieved, the coach's and the ice hockey vice president's vision must be fully aligned with the organization's vision.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him luck in the future.
Roy was named the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the league's best coach in his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a mid-division win, but Minnesota knocked Colorado down in the first round of the playoffs and the team has not made it through in the past two years.
The Avalanche games in 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 losses and 4 draws, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing the Wild Card playoff spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame-elected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue talks and delay strike
Labor disputes by North Sea oil workers over wages will be postponed as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on North Sea drilling rigs run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to re-initiate a process aimed at resolving the current dispute," the joint statement read.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh view of the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year, Wood Group cut North Sea contractors' fees by about 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's fee reduction follows a 10% reduction in the number of contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said further cuts would provide the company with the necessary room for manoeuvre to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as the company streamlines operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's biggest North Sea labor disputes.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, and not just a few, both in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the previous five-year average has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete list of stellar rotation rates in the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at varying speeds, as well as how orbital times are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Pasadena Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, and are just now reaching adulthood.
They are now spinning at their top level.
At their peak rotational speed, these growing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the appearance of identifiable starspots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of stellar rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with bigger ones making pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the 'ballet' of the pleiades, we see that slow spinners tend to be more massive, while the fastest spinners tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for the theoretical models of stellar rotation, encompassing both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and so to speak hang their 'dance shoes' on a nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the rotational speeds of the Pleiades in three articles, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
