Found a 9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy on a flight to Tampere on Tuesday evening.
A missing persons report on a boy who left West Tampere with a friend has spread in social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and is not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told the Evening Sanomat at midnight that he was found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the after-party.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, the father told me.
Ronaldo, on the other hand, ravingly... tore up the paint gap with Messi.
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his work in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the goal kingship of the Champions League turned for at least a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo went to the top of the all-time scorer statistics alone when he shot a visitor on Shahtar Donetski’s network with two hits from the penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80 when, before Tuesday, Barcelona Messi, who was about to level with him, has 77 hits.
Real won the game four-fifty.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league in Serie A from the early season, but in the Champions League’s Pool D it began with a powerful 2-1 guest victory in Manchester City.
The goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of Sergei Aguero, who had a knee problem.
Aguero didn't come to the airport until the last ten minutes of the weekend.
In the Netherlands, the second Manchester club United also suffered severe losses against PSV Endhoven after losing 1-2.
ManU's 20-year-old wingman, Luke Shaw, had only 15 minutes to make it.
The dangerously-looking slipshot of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the ManU box that attacked the target so badly that Shaw probably cracked his tibia.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium about ten minutes before the medical staff left to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests 41 minutes to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno did it before the break with extra time.
In the second half, the PSV was scored by Luciano Narsingh.
The goalmaking season in the Champions League began with the Paris Saint-Germain of Pool A.
It was Angel Di Maria from Argentine who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past the back corner of Malmö goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the other half-time PSG.
The PSG has been put on the line for the season's success.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, a member of the small league clubs, is not the best benchmark.
The PSG Star Attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first encountered Malmö FF, his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, TsSKA, lost a B-block match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded immediate resignation - the president made the wrong speech
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has given the same speech again in the country's parliament at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe is in full spirit.
The main opposition party, MDC, called on Mugabe to resign because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants rushed to say that the confusion had only taken place at Mugabe’s headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mr Mugabe's speech dealt with the impact of China on the economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively those coming to Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, at the table of the Home Affairs Ministers.
The professor admits in an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb at the university asked for an emergency call with a voice shaking a little bit at the police officer's house and told him that he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was present and alive and probably scared. The professor told us that the contact information of the dead woman’s family would be on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on a white document paper: "I am very sorry and I wish I could undo what I did. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," the letter that Lamb signed said to the authorities.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometres to the school campus. The police found Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history who was dead at the door of his office, who is believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, police chief at Delta State University, noted that the university’s authorities were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
One more death could fit into the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police caught him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff stayed behind the locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to find out Lamb’s motive.
The researchers explained the details in both places, and those who knew Lamb told of the man. The researchers were born with a picture of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
The students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to the Gautier police at Prentiss's death, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he had acknowledged "the wonderful people" with whom he was able to lead an academic life.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which had 17 teaching staff. Many of the students attended courses for both men.
However, references to problems arose.
A student who praised the Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "like he was in trouble."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told her about stress at the end of the academic year 2014–2015.
Lamb had previously applied to Delta State University for sick leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay policy meant that the dissertation for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that something was clearly bothering the Lamb.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving campus, the police found out which route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his own life with a 38-caliber pistol in the backyard of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, the Washington County coroner Methel Johnson told.
Lamb's car was still running in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately know why Lamb had gone to this very house, but Johnson told them that he believed that he knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started teaching geography and education at a university with 3 500 students, with 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He was awarded a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb’s long - term friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker back then.
All the girls were all over him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no record of them being married.
A couple of them had a dog named Lightning and lived in a brick house in a river delta in a small town called Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, told us that he resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends and have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was very upset," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lambi, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the humble The Jules Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss on September 5, after Lamb played guitar and harmonica for a few audiences.
There was nothing to tell me that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
They both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his urn, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own fraternity and student union.
At Delta State University campus there are 900 people gathered at a memorial service in candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students and residents.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a night-time event where the university choir presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The lesson will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Associated Press reporters Emily Wagster Pettus in Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also specified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife on the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us does not intend to employ as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products says that he offers his current employees and seasonal workers an opportunity to work more hours.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45 000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will start this month, and new employees will start in October–December.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the business season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire a temporary workforce in shops and in the delivery and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive, and I noticed there was an empty place next to me, and it dawned on me that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox said he was coming to the trailer for the Back in Time documentary.
"When the film began, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time is related to Back to the Future films, and in addition to Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd are interviewed as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" got its premiere 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely the greatest time travel film for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, commented on Russia's intensified military efforts and noted that there was no military solution to the almost five-year conflict and that arms only resulted in more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join forces and to support comprehensive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Ban announced his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month in connection with the UN General Assembly Ministerial Week.
Mr Ban regretted that the disintegration of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to show the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Is Donald Trump serious?
They've tried to label Trump as a idler.
He's also been considered a joke.
Some predict that Trump will collapse.
In Republican circles (for now) every effort has been made to pull Trump out of the poll wire.
Ten of the eleven national polls show Donald Trump two-digit support figures. Some are already seriously considering what it says about the potential candidates for real estate mogul.
True, the elections are only in the early stages.
No one has yet announced Trump's election as a Republican candidate.
Experts remind us that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry was allowed to give space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither finally won the candidate election in any state.
Trump would have a lot of problems in the general election.
External factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have taken note of Trump's strong position and started digging to bring him down.
The following recent polls show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored with a shoulder pruning:
There's been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, according to Monmouth University Gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also hold in the states where the elections are held first.
At the Quinnipiac poll last week, 60 percent of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would welcome Trump's candidacy.
In the CNN and ORC polls last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said they were very satisfied or satisfied with Trump's possible election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastic as Trump (43 percent would be very satisfied with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who's the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, who has a 21% support rate.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected as a party candidate.
Most Republicans don't find Trump's temper problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his pompousness and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate mogul suitable for the president.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the party meeting is held first: according to Quinnipiac-gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump’s personal qualities suitable for the Chief of Defence.
However, according to ABC and Post’s poll, 44 percent consider Trump to be unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump’s temper to be inappropriate for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, according to CNN and ORC polls, four out of ten believe in Trump's possibilities.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall: The Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent of Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans support the other candidate, Trump beats almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that a divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump’s opponents are divided into supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, an opinion poll at Monmouth University revealed that in a fictitious double struggle between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win a larger crowd of supporters.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, Rand Paul by John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would beat Trump with a 19-point difference in a fictitious double struggle.
A narrow majority of Trump's supporters say that they have already taken a vote.
According to the poll published by CBS and NOW on Tuesday, more than half of Trump’s supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's toughest competitor today is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
In his campaign speech, Donald Trump invited immigrants from Mexico two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will expel important Latin-American voters from the Republican forces and hinder the renewal of the brand.
However, according to the polls published on Monday by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are in line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Discontent with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half the Republican votes, and the fact that both have been nominated as outsiders adds significantly to their popularity.
The Republican forces want a fresh face instead of a political champion. According to ABC News and Washington Post’s latest opinion poll, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
These two candidates are also pissed off at Washington.
According to an opinion poll by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activity in Congress: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the verge of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time.
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
For the first time, Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party’s new figurehead, is due to rise to reflect his strength in David Cameron’s Question Time later.
Corbyn will ask his first six questions shortly after noon, and the media and the Labour Party will be watching him hard.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also said that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
This is the first time Corbyn's leadership has been weighed in the context of a parliamentary test, following his speech at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Trade Union Unions (TUC) on Tuesday.
The Labour Party's decision to remain silent during the national anthem at the 75th anniversary of the British air war on Tuesday has been criticised by a number of representatives of the Tory Party and has also ended up in the headlines on the front page of several newspapers.
Corbyn’s silence during the national anthem attracted attention
During the national anthem, Corbyni’s representative noted that Corbyn stood in silence while respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle for Britain.
However, Owen Smith, a member of the shadow government of Corbyn, said in the BBC’s Two’s Newsnight programme that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite the anti- monarchy.
A dozen shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, claiming disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to the party leadership.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant considers that political disagreements over UK membership of the EU and the conditions for granting the government's increased benefits have accumulated in the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At the TUC meeting, Mr Corbyn said that Labour was going to propose changes to remove the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow government Minister for Labour and Pensions, said that the party's position is very clear: it is only opposed to the government's plans to lower the limit from GBP 26 000 to GBP 23 000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron will face over the past decade in the leadership of the Tory Party.
The Labour Director, who promised a new policy approach, says that he has chosen to ask Cameron questions about his 30 000 proposals from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected in the constituency of Islington North, there are too many confrontations in Question Time, and he promises to avoid clever words and loon throwing, and instead says that he is focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that the shadow minister, Angela Eagle, is covering for her in Question Hours, for example when Cameron is on a foreign trip.
Corbyn has also thrown out the idea that others too can sometimes get out loud, saying that he had discussed the matter with the President of the House of Commons, John Bercow.
After Corbyn joined the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted a puppet-like policy that was often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted that he had failed in his efforts.
Since the first televised Question Time in 1990, it has been regarded as a central indicator of the manager’s judgment, control of the lower room and position. However, critics say that Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young people to photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and earn money has been found for the group of former street children.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit photography studio where homeless young people are taught to photograph their home area and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who was one of the first to graduate through the project.

The pound is getting stronger as British wages rise
The pound was strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index up.
In May to July, wages rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year. No bonuses were included.
Faster than predicted growth was fastest since 2009.
The pound rose by 1% and its exchange rate was quoted at USD 1,5505. The pound also increased in relation to the euro and was quoted at EUR 1,37330.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6,229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course was affected by 20 % when the company received a preliminary bid from the competing company AB InBev.
If the transaction were to take place, it would bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world and bring brands under the same roof, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the wake of the competitive Richemont Group's positive results on luxury products.
Richemont’s latest sales figures are better than forecast. The development of sales was also a result of an increase in Burberry’s key market in China.
Glencore's share increased by 5 per cent after the mining company announced its intention to raise USD 2.5 billion in the share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares in Mondi, the packaging and paper group, were the biggest drop of 4,3 % when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's share price for sale.
The price of JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its return before taxes would rise by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports Manager: higher wage costs could hamper expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Management Team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches a grass-roots campaign against Aldi's invasion
Metcash aims to secure its IGA store from the Aldi takeover in southern and western Australia.
The food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia against Aldi’s $700 million Australian invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centres and the first of up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build an IGA brand by marketing in mainstream media and social media and by organising events such as Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the Dunsborough ice cream factory Simmo offers tasters in IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to regular customers for the South Australia Football League for a discount.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade wholesale will organise the annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, since southern and western Australia account for almost 30 % of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and these regions have a higher margin yield than the IGA retail network in the eastern Länder.
In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in Western Australia 24%, while in the eastern Länder it is only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley’s analysts believe that Aldi will catch up with 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain eats sales from all operators, but especially from operators independent of the chains.
This week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimates that the sale of IGA traders could reach 360 million and Metcash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in southern and western Australia next year and will reach 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and volumes can mean a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, says Kierath.
At the same time, Metcast loses market share in the eastern Länder mainly to Ald and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA’s customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the leading portfolio manager of Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that he considered it very likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash government contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the result of the Metcash food business serving 1200 IGA retailers has fallen by 43 per cent from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesale trader takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of over $150 million in Australia in order to meet Coles and Woolworths' prices for hundreds of products every week. The chain wants to support retailers in renovating shops so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food supply of their own brands.
According to Metcash’s CEO Ian Morrice, price adjustments and store renewal plans are well under way, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association, defends Thanasi from Kokkinaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of his behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Association, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateral victim of the recent Nick Kyrgios-related stuff.
The younger party of the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was caught in an unfavorable spotlight when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly after this, in a competition between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to separate the rivals twice. "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios and my friend," Harrison said.
In the open United States, Kokkinakis frustratedly struck a bat in the field when powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinaki.
At the moment, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the U.S. Open. He is not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas well enough to know that he is not proud of what he did.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative behaviour of Harrison in the open in the United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature until he is 19 years old, works hard and complements the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He practices hard, is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged by his own merites."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from Australia’s team on an important tour starting on a Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra’s breeder to long-term confirmation of the team.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on matches instead of the Kyrgios-related polemic," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man is going to grow up in the spotlight of publicity. He deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to create peace for him. I believe that it is best for both the team and Nick.”
European Migration Crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared an emergency, closed its southern border to Serbia on Tuesday and seized illegal immigrants to prevent the flow of migrants.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants flocked to a non-national country, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People fleeing violence had to stay on the road between national checkpoints in their tents for an indefinite period of time
Frustration began to surface.
While the police helicopter was flying in the air above the colonists, they kept saying, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them went into protest at the strike of eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Minister stated that it would not accept that migrants should be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase the damage.
The situation must be discussed in Brussels in the next few days, and also in other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A day later, when a group of 28 countries failed to develop a common policy on migration at a controversial meeting in Brussels, Hungary and Serbia began to experience an uproar.
However, ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40 000 floods of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, and the hope arose that an agreement could be reached by next month or the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for immediate action in Brussels or in neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, an emergency developed so that the authorities in the two southern regions were allowed to adopt more effective measures, i.e. to close you down and speed up the judicial processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence at the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrants from that direction, now that there is already a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tendering process for the finalisation of barbed wire skills between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point to the European Union for immigrants, many of whom are refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of the people arriving are refugees of living standards, not refugees of war who have the right to seek refuge, a view which is radically different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-metre barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border in the direction of Serbia, and to set longer prison times for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the government announces a state of crisis," Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, told journalists in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We are following a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to accept military action, which is expected next week: journalists from the Associated Press on the border have been seeing heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days now.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the Internal Security Adviser for Orban, reported that the authorities have apprehended 45 attempts to cross the border immediately at the border and 15 further away.
People who have crossed the border by harming the fence are now in police custody, charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
Authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday, and one border crossing point was closed by means of a rail wagon covered with barbed wire.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary, when Hungarians opened an entry point into a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left outside.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary, and people announced that they were on an eating and drinking strike until they were admitted to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership against Bernie Sanders reduced by half according to national polls
The support rate for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is still two figures in the race for the National Democratic President, but Senator Bernie Sanders has narrowed the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of the democrats (decrease from 58%), while Sanders is second to 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced that he might be joining the presidential race, and his support for the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early to tell the majority of democrats which candidate they are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more confident of their choice than the other candidates.
Since the poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of several groups of democrats, while new supporters have joined the Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly and has only a 5% bow against Sanders.
Clinton has lost his headship among those under 50-year-old democrats, and he is now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton’s head start in support of Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of neck in Clinton in this group.
About half of the democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15 percent would support him simply because he was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton’s current supporters would also be particularly enthusiastic if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more fragmentation among those who are not currently in favour of Clinton, and only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supporting him.
Forty-eight percent of democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35 percent of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
When Clinton’s voters are asked to freely describe why they support his nomination, the most popular argument is Clinton’s correct experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13%) and thirdly that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
There is also mention of a common view and the possibility of winning the actual elections.
The vice-president is still weighing on his potential candidacy, and 57% of the democrats would like him to join the race, but a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the democrats are asked of the second most popular candidate as a party candidate, the majority choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his head start with Sanders, 20 percentage points ahead of him, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of democrats consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual elections, but this has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, number two, is a long way from Clinton, but more and more people believe in Biden's chances of winning the actual election.
Democratic voters, however, attach more importance to views on the subject than to the candidates' chances of winning.
The voters do not think that any democratic candidates or potential candidates are unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and leader types.
Biden is often described as being honest, while Clinton is often considered to be the type of leader.
As many as 30% of democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, while 15% do Sanders. 27% do not know if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the electorate's own ideology.
For all features, about a quarter do not have an opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are consulted on the use of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and its own server as Foreign Minister, the majority of democrats say that they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and that it has not changed the view of these voters about Clinton.
There's a difference of opinion between the Americans on a wider scale.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
A majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall view of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these qualities when the views of all voters are asked: Clinton sees only 32% as honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not consider Clinton to be honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
But both Clinton and Trump get good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates in the polls, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, not many people have an opinion about Sanders.
The sample is 351 voters and the margin of error in the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson closes Donald Trump's head start in the national support poll
According to CBS News and the latest poll of the New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates took more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters throughout the country, Trump still has strong support. The support rate has risen from 23% of the CBS survey conducted before Fox News' debate last month. According to a poll published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
Carson's support, however, would be a huge increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the poll, Carson has strong support for all population groups, and in a group of college students, he's going to beat Trump.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are far behind. The support of Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is the weakest and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio in Florida distributed third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6 per cent in one direction or another. The survey was conducted in September.
According to the CNN and ORC's latest survey last week, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19% of Republicans in favour of him, compared with 32% of Trump's support.
Also in ABC News and Washington Post’s latest survey Trump was in clear leadership ahead of Carson.
Last week, Trump made false accusations against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday during his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the fraternity accused of the death of Baruch College freshman.
Almost two years ago, five persons are charged with murder after the death of a student in the church ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.
The members of the Baruch College (City University of New York) Pi Delta Psi’s group brutally assaulted Chu’s “Michael” Deng’s baptism in September 2013. According to the police, Deng was not delivered to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim’s eyes were tied, his back was covered with a bag of sand that was nearly 15 kg, and he had been repeatedly attacked in an attempt to reach a target located on the other side of an ice field.
Deng is reported to have first complained of headaches and then passed out.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps frat didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, and they said they waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told us at the press conference that the members had time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the chairman of the committee, Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide the instruments, putting the interests of the partnership ahead of the health of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng had been hit several times in the head, upper body, and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the coven's chimp, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the chimp since 1970," says Deng's family lawyer Douglas Fierberg in his statement.
They and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
A grand jury in Monroe County presented five members of the fraternity to be charged with the murder of a third degree.
In addition, 32 members of the fraternity will be charged with bullying and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to take responsibility not only for individuals, but also for an organisation that officially or informally accepted the plague," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed an operating ban on the company and the national group resigned from the local department.
This is how the interest rate increase of the Federal Reserve (Fedin) will affect
The rise in interest rates and the boom in the stock market fades, the return on securities rises and the economy slides into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
Especially as regards the economy, we find an indication of timing in history.
The recession has come up to 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, but not always. The key factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the Central Bank officials have already been very anxious to see investors not paying attention to the fact that interest rates start to rise, but to how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising interest rates can be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, the chief global economicist of Capital Economics told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level; it is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there are no effects.
Here are examples of how impacts can be reflected in different economic sectors, based on historical trends:
As has been seen on the market for about a month now, the prospect of raising interest rates can increase instability for a time.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be a halting of interest income on capital after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which may reflect a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analyst noted in a recent study of the consequences of the rise in interest rates.
In a revised 35-year period, a sharp rise in interest rates is generally seen in the market, around 14%, fairly steady for the next 250 days (mean increase of 2.6%), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average return on interest after six stock changes is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, the chief equity strategist of Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares will generally increase slightly at a later stage of the cycle and interest income will begin to decrease.
The recession is a fact of the economy, but the rise in interest rates generally works.
In this case, if a central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist in the past and could accelerate the downturn.
Particularly noteworthy is the fact that gross domestic product is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 interest rates were raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value was below 4,5 %.
Although the second quarter of 2015 seems to be 3.6 per cent, many did not think it would last, and in the third quarter it is 1.5 per cent, says the Atlanta Regional Bank.
In raising interest rates in such a delicate economic situation, there may be a risk and one might ask whether this situation is different," Deutsche said.
The market players have been talking about raising the steering rate throughout the year, and they are looking at this week’s Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trade will only show a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles up to this day have been in a super cycle, where before the downturn, GDP will also rise very rapidly after the boom," states the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst recession of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest the Central Bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now is already on the 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been unstable in the market for interest rate raising, and the formula is repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
For bonds, the return appears to change direction as soon as the first cycle of increase/decrease starts.
At the end of the rising cycle, revenues will decrease immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that raising interest rates will bring long-term and short-term bonds closer together and smoothing the curve.
"High-yield bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," Schwab's fixed-income securities analyst Kathy Jones said.
Fascinatingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the strengthening of the Dollar and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adjustment to the tightening of financial policy," says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is direct, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased.
Extensively, companies operating mainly on the US market will benefit because interest rates are falling and local products are becoming attractive.
The prospects for the indebted multinationals are weaker, as the stronger dollar makes their products tilt on the global market and their debt is higher.
"History shows that quality shares will be more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet beat the weak balance sheet enterprises by an average of five percentage points after the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Non-financial corporations with high return on capital and low volatility shares were also doing better than lower quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better.
"The debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable interest rates are losing the most", Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers generally also benefit from the appreciation of the dollar.
The savers also benefit from higher returns. However, experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Parliamentarian Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for overpopularisation.
According to Bingham, today the channel is difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
Also claims to be only a copy of the BBC Music Awards.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of the Classic FM channel, adding pressure to the station to prove that it offers more to each commercial radio station.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that the radio channel of the broadcaster is becoming too populist and that the channel is hardly separated from its commercial competitor.
"I hate to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards award ceremony last December also receives criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, organized for the first time last year, seem like a copy of the British Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of a new and different one, we are simply imitating what is already on the market," Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers significantly more live music and educational content than a commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 taught me something about classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The channel’s commitment to live music and music is in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3’s director Alan Davey said that the station needs to work even harder to maintain public interest, because the British know classical music even better.
However, Radio 3 is not the only one who has been critical of entering the territory of commercial channels during the consultation of the BBC, the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory MP Damien Collins criticised the The Voice talent contest, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media, which is estimated at £22 million.
"The programme is hardly discussed, because it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 program, which is starproof by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical way for the BBC.
In addition, Collins insisted that the company look for a hit show in its own garage the next time it launches a new show of entertainment.
However, Mr Collins refused to rule out the fact that the "The Voice" series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be spent on other entertainment formats.
Growth in e-commerce is the slowest ever in August – perhaps due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
The sales of e-commerce have been recorded since 2000. Last month, growth was the slowest ever.
The online store was strengthened three years ago with mobile purchases.
Experts believe that the Black Friday of November can curb the desire to buy.
For more than ten years, many of Britain’s shopping streets have been desolated by the conquest of an online store.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slowest during the whole period when the sales of e-commerce have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that e-commerce is stabilising and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth to the 2000 figures, it is clear that growth will stabilise over time," IMRG's editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, e-commerce accelerated three years ago when consumers took up mobile purchases.
"It enabled more and more people to buy online, and buying for many was possible in a different environment, for example from a sofa.
As mobile purchasing is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered one of the reasons for the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the European Day on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers compared to normal, caused many retailers to crash their websites.
Experts believe that black Friday, which makes consumers crowd in after offers, can curb the desire to buy in the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every five pounds was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of shopping - street fashion stores.
The Mecca burys the victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden’s family in charge
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims on the streets when the first funeral took place in Mecca.
According to Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Binladin Group, a large construction company, is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured when the crane fell.
The bodies were carried high in the air when the Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of Mecca's Great Mosque.
A crowd of people dressed in white had gathered on the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The grief convoy traveled to a pilgrimage, where the fallen crane had only one day earlier penetrated the roof of the mosque onto the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia demands that Bin Laden's construction family company be held responsible for an accident in which 394 people were injured.
The bodies of 29 victims of Mecca's Great Mosque accident were transported on the streets.
When the crane fell among the dead, there was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were starting their annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have promised that the hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to an Arabic press release, the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The news agency’s English service did not report in detail. However, according to the English press release, the Group’s management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crash of the crane in the courtyard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims are headed for the Great Mosque on the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a press release on the crash and the Group's representatives have not been reached for the opinion.
The King also accused the Group of failing to comply with up-to-date safety regulations and to cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mekka's Grand Moskeijja as part of Binladin Group's giant construction project.
For decades the Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi dynasty, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of significant construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son whose family had abandoned him in the 1990s.
The crash in the heavy rain and the hard wind took place just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which every capable Muslim has a duty to do at least once during life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (about EUR 250 000) to the families of the victims and those permanently disabled.
Other people injured in an accident receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind this phenomenon.
The British hire the generals of the home more often, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled workers who come from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new trades for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, principal correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to transfer home hammering and painting jobs to those who come from Eastern Europe.
Vasoring and painting skills seem to be scarce these days.
Today, the British are hiring more and more handymen in the home to handle home jobs, reports the director of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the store chain of home refurbishment equipment. According to Laury, the reason for this is professional workers arriving from Eastern Europe who provide services at low prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new trade-oriented Screwfix stores, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Laury needs more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by a woman.
At the moment, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, demographic trends deserve attention, as more and more single women are now renovating their homes.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of our purchases are made by women.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are in the trunk of British FTSE 100 companies and has also reorganized the management team so that there is a balance between male and female managers.
Kingfisher is almost unique, as 50% of its staff are women, including the CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women on the board."
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures show a decrease, although the company worked hard after the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The government of three aces decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
Visible effects were thus obtained quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employee centre organisations began to be forced right away and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of a large number of workers' protests.
There's a lot of people who think there's reason there, too.
Let's see if it's a good idea to strike when things are bad anyway.
A resistance movement has even been established.
More than 50 000 people have already gone online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old time of good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring yourself a criminal would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of millions of trade unions does not give much thought to it, but it does give cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement. Values have changed.
From the point of view of the attractiveness of Ay movement’s operations, the Government’s drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years when things have seemed to be spinning in their own weight, the unions finally get to the point of defending, visibly and properly the employee’s rights.
In this way, the government may wish to detain the role of the Ay movement, as membership of the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary.
No matter what you think about the activities of the organizations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration will somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been falling for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things should force everyone's head.
High saving for the University of Lappeenranta: To achieve savings of 8.5 million, 130 staff will be reduced
Lappeenranta University of Technology will start a austerity course aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start negotiations on staff as a whole, with an annual savings target of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of some 130 employees.
In addition, two million will be saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates a deficit of 8.5 million.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
In this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in education and research and the reduction in corporate funding on our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in the university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in additional funding is now reflected in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will start on Tuesday next week and will last for the six weeks prescribed by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
Sir Brian Souter, the owner of the cheap bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in participating in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain," Souter says.
Rail transport should gradually open up to competition.
The first is local traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic will take place.
Souter says he's already approached the Department of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Of the other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia) has expressed interest in rail transport, which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
US central bank interest rate decision time
The whole world is following the meeting of the Federal Reserve of the United States on Wednesday and Thursday, where a possible increase in interest rates will be decided for the first time in almost a decade.
More than half of the economists, who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current 0-0,25 %, as shown by a survey conducted by the 80 economists in Reuters.
"This is an historic situation, since the central bank has kept interest at zero for seven years now.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start to normalise interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The economic situation in the United States has been relatively good and the recovery has brought in trillions of extra dollars and has brought little inflation to the balance sheet.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore a global situation that is less rosy.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be published on Thursday 20.00 Central European Time.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note apologizing for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the authorities said on Tuesday.
Lamb, who teaches geography and social science in Gautier, Mississippi, Delta State University, called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, he told me he shot a person.
Lamb made an emergency call to the police at his house.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that was no trouble to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't give me any motive for the shooting either.
The police arrived at the scene and found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, as well as a note written by Lamb's hand saying, "I'm very sorry, and I wish I could call it off.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of History before taking his life late on Monday when the police caught him.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that something was clearly bothering the Lamb.
On Monday it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also romantically involved with Schmidt. However, the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triangle drama.
Shawn O'Steen, married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
The man said the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss's, Lindsay Knowles, told us that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said Prentiss had been dating Lamb for about three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them he was not going to go to prison.
When the police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Darkened Stars
The last few years have been hard on the actor (on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw sidelined for months due to two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right leg broke in the Manchester United Champions League fight against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman is sorry to stay away for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal remains hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field this season.
Twenty-year-old Shaw was injured in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno in the PSV defense area when the game was running for 15 minutes.
Shaw received first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg and he's in hospital," said Van Gaal.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
A young man who joined the Manchester United ranks at the age of 18 has been through a lot and is now injured after a great game.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two places, he'll be on the sidelines for half a month and he won't play in the block phase anymore.
I hope he can still play this season.
Moreno seemed to have got away with it when the situation did not result in a red card being fired.
The judge of the match Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can deduce for yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-footed, reckless tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't say how crushed I am. My recovery starts here and I'll come back stronger."
More about: Manchester United's Luke Shaw aside at the PSV game
The British defender has a particular reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championships in France in June.
“It’s a very bad injury,” said PSV’s coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno did not break his legs in the Mexican ranks until the 2014 World Cup in the Netherlands, piloted by Van Gaal.
"He is very sorry, for his intention was not to harm the opponent. I am sorry to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
All I saw was a ball that was going the other way, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I'm really sorry, I'm very sorry."
PSV’s Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, each parent realizes that the child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for what you see, David Cameron.
When the Children’s Holiday Organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children’s books, the prime minister chose Lorax, Dr. Seuss’ teaching environmental story published in 1971.
In a text published on SuperCamp’s website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. “The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I’m happy to read it to my children because there’s always a picture or a message we haven’t noticed before.”
Sounds good, except that the next point in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to complete the short initial text.
"In the city of Tarville, where the real trees and plants have disappeared and even the air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams by implementing this greatest dream: to see the right tree," says the text. In 1991, in Dr. Seuss Geisel's version, Ted had no crush on him.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly consistent with the plot summary of the Lorax movie on the Internet Movie Database. It starts with the following: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be so alien to him. Greed Kerskanen destroys trees and manufactures the necessarys despite the resistance of the name character Lorax. Lorax is a small, thick, mustached creature that protects forests.
Likely, a public relations mission such as this, of minor importance, has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being off the English team, but it's still hard.
The meeting with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but once we see the defeat of the last 3-0 Test series by the team chosen by England on the tour, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the team from three years ago, but the team has good players and the team’s attitude is strong – they do not have bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a spiral feeder, and Adil Rashid, even though he does not have the test level experience, represents the attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to exclude Adam Lyth is difficult for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been against two good attacks under challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches would have kept Lyth on the team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
The question of how long the Test-beater will be given the opportunity to impress is difficult.
Lyth got seven ground games, like his predecessor Sam Robson, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at both home and guest games.
Perhaps the only complaint is that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in excellent shape – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is gonna be on the team, and he's a hitter that I really appreciate.
He's a cricket player of an unknown author we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this obviously depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start a batting shift with Cook, which will get an extra spin-thrower in the game while four speed-feeders are being held, and I am not against the idea.
I don't see any obstacle to a top pitcher hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have accomplished much on his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been the third player on the team, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first player to replace him before he got started in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points, and there was no going back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a backup wheel feeder, and based on what I have seen about him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher — and this may be a long shot, but not many twist pitchers have proved themselves ready, and the voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this fight trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a few intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan beater, Mahela Jayawardene, as the advisor to the Test matches may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the sweetest men of the sport, who brings with him much experience because he has played under all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball of the game and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he's always seemed to fit the international cricket, whether his role is a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a stimulant injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root had the same opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and voters do not set a match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
These decisions are never taken without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in bad shape in 2017
David Cameron's semi-necessary renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is day by day deeper and deeper in the swamp, even without pleasing Jeremy 'yes' or 'no' Corbynia in the leadership of the Labour Party or the TUC in a violent mockery of Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wreaking havoc – even though not everyone is an act of its own – with some Member States tired of Britain's self-righteous agenda, which includes dissensional concessions and harmful Treaty changes that they do not really want.
In Brighton, at the annual Congress of the TUC, it was decided that they too would not be happy in the EU if it were to undermine social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor are hanging out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, catching a picture of themselves in front of the famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, returning home and telling them that they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point where we no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the prudent Chancellor of Germany is an ally, but he has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it gets ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French François Hollande will be faced with re-election or successor selection in 2017.
His power is waning, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain has a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them running to help the selfie British who could use their energy better to try to stop Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and that is not what they want, because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some such ministers may plan to deliberately throw useless comments like the Scottish National Party in the 2017 UK National Election Campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiations were an organized case." "The British had nothing to do with the renegotiations."
Europeans know how the British press hunts and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, the result of which was in favour of 2:1 joining the EU in 1973.
Someone may recall Boris Johnson, a clever Euro-opportunist who became known as our 'EU direct banana correspondent' in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
These include tax evasion, telephone hacking and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas as a distraction so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was even more blairistic than Blair when he opposed the referendum, as Blair agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected, and when France and the Netherlands rejected the treaty in the referendum 2005, Blair was easily off the hook.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me, and there may be a risk that he'll introduce Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s, which was a mistake and still is.
Time may pass, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whom he sat on the BBC couch on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call upbuilding.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory can probably answer yes to this.
That is what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told on radio and television this week when her inner boy scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move for Corbyn to appoint rough John McDonnell as shadow finance minister.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had difficulty on television being disloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's troubles were more interesting.
Mr Benn said that he was opposed to staying in the EU 'under all circumstances', and Mr McDonnel did not say so to his colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Corby wanted to pass on any sucky picture, you have to remember that he even touched me. Communication discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud are spreading.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for granted in the referendum, as Mr McDonnell has said.
At least this is what Simon Jenkins thinks.
Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn's interoperability of EU membership is compatible with the Bennite blockade and the anti-capitalist past. The discussions no longer belong to a narrow circle of left-wing dissidents, to whom the idea of similarity is a central dogma in the doctrine of doctrinal strife.
There has also been an attack on NATO, and Tom Watson is unflinching in the fact that Corby is not campaigning for departure, and foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter in their countries of origin.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital and have suspicious voters, and why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the pathetic British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the Tory regime, which I was reminded of on Monday at the launch of the British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticised the British authorities' statements on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims made by a state-funded agency that the smoking of e-cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were generated by a meeting where 12 participants are linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented by the Public Health England (PHE) in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE described its report last month as "a comprehensive and forward-looking review of the results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and highlighted the links of some experts with the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal’s editorial included a “sublime foundation” on which the main conclusion of the PHE is based.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have wondered whether the claims were based on “rock or sand”.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health Care at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated: "The basic assumption of public health care is that the policy is based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that the claim made by the PHE that "currently best estimate e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim stems from one meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model, which sought to harmonise participants' views on the disadvantages of nicotine products. The results were collected in the study.
According to McKee and Capewell, the participants in the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose former independent research, according to sources, has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the CEO demonstrated support for BAT’s public health activities in the Sustainability Report.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from the tobacco company Philip Morris International did not.
There is no explanation of the selection criteria for the panel, but there are a number of well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom admit their involvement in the financing of industry.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Tobacco Officer.
According to McKee and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no conclusive evidence of the harmfulness of the products in a large part of the products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, no links or shortcomings are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far no evidence has been provided that e-cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at the PHE, these claims have been answered in the past.
According to Fenton, e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Every other person who smokes throughout life dies because of addiction to tobacco.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further investigated.
The PHE is obliged to inform the public what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80 000 deaths per year related to smoking, and smoking costs the public health sector £2 billion per year.
Responsible action requires us to clearly demonstrate the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free alternative, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, head of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit series such as the soap opera Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should only be used for the production of programs that are not made by other television stations.
He criticised the presentation of programmes likely to reach a smaller audience than the BBC, at the same time as the large audiences of competitors, as well as, for example, on BBC4.
After the BBC president Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get Channel 4 to cooperate with the BBC for six years, without success.
"I do not agree with the idea that the BBC buys formats and broadcasts programmes that are clearly part of the software of a competing channel," Johnson told the communication committee in the House of Lords, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep a broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its offer to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others at least.
The BBC sends The Voice to prime time because it wants as broad a support as possible in the future.
If no other channel takes the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should be used to finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," said Johnson.
The Voice is one of these, the EastEnders second, although it is one of its own productions.
A lot of channels would give you their right hand over it.
I do not understand how this serves the services of the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss for the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010. He believes that the BBC is picking up good ratings because the company employs ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson’s comments on BBC’s most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s Niche audience’s programmes are displayed on BBC4, where viewers are often not measurable, but they meet their purpose. “BBC can say, in defending its hypocritical missions, that it did make special programmes that nobody watched.”
"The BBC presents them at times when no one ever sees them."
Regarding the radio charges, Mr Johnson said: "I challenge you to find another system as old-fashioned as that for who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 a year is cheap, but the people to whom it is a lot of money, especially if the BBC is not looking at much."
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also expressed his views in committee on Tuesday, stated that the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any educational programs in the current BBC offer – 1 % on television and 0,1 % on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and turn its mission into a new faith: "information, lighting and entertainment".
On the cooperation issue, Elstein suggests that the BBC could add broadcasts to events such as the Proms festival, the concerts of which were broadcast last year only a fraction. "BBC should also join alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offering available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics
The video shows how the nematode changes direction when ultrasonic is applied.
Scientists have grown worms whose neural systems have been genetically altered, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small shuttle worms change their course when they are subjected to ultrasonic frequency above the hearing area of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified to have a transport membrane that reacts to ultrasound.
More on: Researchers monitor brain activity by light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetics (dubbed sonogenetics) method, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an external stimulus.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method for treating Parkinson’s disease, where the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
The shuttle depressions do not normally respond to the ultrasound. However, Chalasani noticed that the worms begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to Chalasan, the bubbles enhance the ultrasound waves that move inside the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are found in part of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells on which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttleworms by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of the nerves that controlled their movement appeared in the TRP4 ion channels.
When the modified worms were controlled by ultrasonics, the microbubbles reinforced the sound waves and moved to the worms, triggering a signal in the nerve cell.
This method is somewhat like optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows scientists to activate nerve cells with light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is applied to the brain under investigation by means of optical fibers. Low-frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, penetrate the cell easily so that ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that through gene therapy and viral therapy, human neurons can be momentarily exposed to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin producing cells.
Illegal Torture Equipment — At Your Home Door!
Advertising is a disgrace to Britain's arms trade.
Watch Amnesty International's anti-armament exhibition video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leghold traps!
Grape bombs!
Seizures that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The purpose of the video, produced by Amnesty International, is to highlight the efforts of the British Government to sell weapons to repressive governments at the DSEI (Deefence Security and Equipment International) exhibition in London, Docklands, at the ExCel.
More on: DSEI: authoritarian regimes arriving in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subway cars that require another look.
"At the end of the metro line there is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the metro line.
"In September, a group of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands, and customers will be asked to help us close the arms fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were featured at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound "Fixed space hacking package" with hexagon keys that claim to have access to about a third of the world's bus stop advertising poster racks.
Transport for London isn't funny about poster vandalism.
One of the cartoon ads in the Special Patrol Group.
According to the curator of Cruel Designs and the lecturer at the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question matters and want to bring their political work to the public outside the galleries.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the real world. Many of them go to work with activists of protest movements.
One of the posters against the arms trade greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed on Facebook over 100,000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both graphic designer and multipliers have also done their work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, saw the absence and empty passage of the fair advertisement in the ExCeL event calendar. He thought: "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to make a more realistic, shady corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract attention."
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us to highlight the trade fair where there is illegal trafficking in torture equipment," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded right at our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative piece of the gun fair is displayed in the exhibition rooms themselves in ExCeL, where exhibitors make use of spectacular euphemisms of their merchandise.
In his press release, Saab announced an order from the U.S. Army concerning the "recoverable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specialized warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student housing
I moved to a student dorm 11 years ago. I was an innocent 19-year-old and still believed in beretts and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I irritated, and countless, long complaints about others.
The most important lessons I can sum up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm is the most stressful experience and, at its worst, shocking.
It's easy to start babbling: tell everyone what you are about, tell everyone if you've had a year off and why you like Corbyn and why you don't "just hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, hahhaha, I'm in my room."
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe — show interest and ask others questions.
Asking questions will guide the conversation and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your chips were on fire and these people would hand out fire extinguishers.
Give the others some room.
Our own rooms often serve as drinks, cinemas and public lounges, but our own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More about: Don’t even think of combining dating and university studies
For the Introverts, the university is a tough place.
Our own room should be a place to calm down. However, many dormitories form a social culture in which to wander from one room to another and to form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
It is not possible to say in this environment: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can recharge the energy I used by dating you."
Try to see if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was a guy in my student dorm who thought the unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies properly when the baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50's, a little weird case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small. Smile when I ask you personal questions."
Homemade delicacies are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends are forced to talk to you, and thanks to a tasty surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakerial skills from you.
If you serve unhappy flour, sugar, and fat-wrapped clumps, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is also a common offence in student dorms.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour a drop of milk out of someone else's can?
Always check with the owner of the milk carton.
You'll probably get permission even if you borrow milk from the owner of your can.
I understand that it is annoying if someone steals something from you. However, try to handle the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my own student friend who loitered detergent in his milk to punish milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make any noise when people try to sleep or study.
Not only is it polite, but it is also worth remembering that every other hole is dug...
In my own dorm, a girl asked the person in the next room to turn the music down, for it was three in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally shut up, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, took a three-hour exam, left the music in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband moved into the same dorm?
And wouldn't it be weird if you first thought that your college buddy was your future mate, started dating, divorced and had to see him every day and lost the right of your friends to visit him?
Of course, the heart does want what it wants, and if the study buddy is definitely not the only one, try to control his desire.
If you find at a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the limit of prank and bullying is more subtle than one might think.
A good joke is funny, but one you can recover from in no time.
Hiding an object may be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one’s room should be confused with toothpaste and shampoo.
You can lock the door in the other room and drop the keys into a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but don’t put anyone’s things on the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple more times.
Racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kitee - The house planned as a reception centre was mauled in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on the residence of foreign students in Kitele, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not the accommodations of underage asylum seekers, but the sleeping rooms of foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher of the Evangelical Folk High School in Kite.
The windows and walls of folk high school accommodations were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation room," says the Eastern Finland Police.
According to Luke, responsible teacher for youth social guarantee training at the Folk high school, there were an estimated ten people in the vandalised building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend, and adult people are free to move, so some might have been elsewhere," says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated at the Folk High School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in the mucked-up building have a status.
Some of them study in adult comprehensive school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukainen says.
The A status is a so-called continuous residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of injury and violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, an information conference was held for students on Monday, including the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time that something like this has happened," says Lukeinen.
According to the reading, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The perpetrators were suspected of being at least three men and had been on the move by a light passenger car.
I think this is a young people's weekend whim, since this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," says Luke.
There is also a hospital in Salo that has been maimed with a reception center.
The case happened last week.
This was told by MTV on its website on Tuesday night.
There was a swastika drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
There's been a report from the police.
Ambition 15.9. 16:02 Corrected for incorrect police data on the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government's going to shut down the Y train to Karjaa with all the passengers in their hands, "just idiotic."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja stops running in March.
The news upset passengers arriving at the main railway station in Helsinki at the beginning of the evening shift.
In particular, the descent strikes the people of the Siuntites," said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is absolutely idiotic because the population is constantly increasing and people in work need a fast and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can't be about anything but political will or lack of political will.
Bengtström says with HSTV's interview video he'll be taking a tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are disabled.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train traffic in the next contractual period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in autumn will be adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, a citizen of Siuntio, considers that the state train cutter is short-sighted.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
And then there's regret.
The Y-train is also used by others other than the Raseporians and the Siuntians, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyryä from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further from the city area by train.
"It is particularly bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said in pain on the Y train.
There's gonna be a little relief.
There is probably a new train connection to the beach track, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, i.e. it will take you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will entail increased costs for HSL, in practice for the municipalities and their taxpayers in the region.
"We are now starting to explore the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to estimate the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid around one million dollars per year for the Y train, the Ministry of Transport is much more than this.
The R line on the main track skips two stations.
In Ainola and Saunakallio, on the other hand, the number of trains will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train shifts will decrease on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips a year are made on end-of-life shifts, compared with a total of about nine million trips in traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to provide the State with annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on the topicality of Capital: "Marx is worth exploring"
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, to the top, writes Yrjö Hakanen, a former Chairman of the SKP, in his book Marx's Capital Time Today.
"He is now being taken more seriously than in a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of financial and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly farsighted.
The list of authors of the book based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University's professor, a respected financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes that Marx is current "now and forever".
But the former Managing Director of the Business Research Institute and the Business Delegation is not a Marxist, is it?
No, no, no, no.
On the phone Korkman says that he does not view Marx as a timely economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary scholar.
"The usual view is that the history of ideas tells of the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went a long way wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the early stages of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that is changing as a result of a technological revolution," Korkman says.
But what the government should decide tomorrow, Marx won't help.
After all, he felt that capitalism was a hopeless case and should only be stopped.
Still, Korkman thinks it's a good idea to get to know Marx.
"In the '70s Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskists and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political burdens of the past.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mind as well as other classics," says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for a special court to be set up to investigate war crimes committed in Sri Lanka’s civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil Tigers of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100 000 people have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There's no record of the number of victims.
In particular, the military attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as the UN report calls for.
The report blames the Sri Lankan Armed Forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence as likely as men and women.
According to the report, rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children into combat.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
On Wednesday, Sri Lanka replied that it was going to organise the investigation itself, but was not going to allow the UN Court to be set up because of the foreign judges.
In the English yo experiment, you got to weigh social media.
On Wednesday, the autumn matriculation examination had a long foreign language, most of which was English.
Over 16,000 new recruits tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media or something.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the 150-250 - word writing in English could address the online magazine’s advice column to the administrator.
The headline was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelian reclining chair.
He was to be consulted on how to get parents to look at things also for young people.
In total, there were four subjects, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," said English lecturer Mia Lybeck of Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school.
The third subject was just a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject, Lybeck said, was all right.
It was supposed to write a fire speech about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing to write speeches," Lybeck says, and evaluates the whole experiment as "pretty normal".
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts that addressed, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday some long Russian (168 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the second Finnish or Swedish test will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the test is arranged normally, so it is not influenced by the employee's demonstration.
The matriculation examination board invites the trainees to find suitable transport connections in time for the trial.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a store was robbed at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in the Kello district on Wednesday morning in Oulu.
According to the police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a face-covering Komandopy.
He's normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and got a small amount of money.
It's being investigated as a felony robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support patrols from other parts of Finland
The protest against the Government's decision to cut will block the city center on Friday, predicts the police.
According to preliminary reports, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK federations will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
On the other hand, it is not only the task of the police at work to carry out the alarm missions and other police activities, but also to ensure that the giant demonstration goes smoothly.
Roads to the railway market are closed to motor vehicles between 9.30 and 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the western direction from Mannerheiminti.
Do you have enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for the time being, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on a cop's industrial battles.
According to Kujala, there are support patrols coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland due to the demonstration.
The police won't tell us exactly how many patrols they've got.
"Something's coming, but we'll be fine on our own as a rule," Kujala says.
The police urge you to avoid private cars in the city center of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standing traffic can be expected from the morning to the beginning of the evening.
With protestors from other parts of Finland there are also a lot of ordering buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't let them go to the Railway Market.
As a rule, the buses are quite distant.
The rest of the trip will then have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a positive side to this.
The issue of the smooth running of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now dealt with partly by itself.
The organisers have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary people who work or are unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," says Kujala.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday in different parts of Finland.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, it does not have a very good benchmark in Finnish political history," says Emeritus Martti Siiäinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Eliotäinen.
A very right-wing government has hit at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that we are actually trying to bring the Ay movement to its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
Mirrors are needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration will bring about among those whom the Ay movement would like to see involved in the demonstration.
In November 1993, unemployed persons from all over Finland showed their minds at the Parliament House.
If you look for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant protest of the unemployed, Murrostortstai, held in 1993, says Siiäinen.
In the midst of the deepest recession, the Murrostorstai gathered together 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (central government) stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as it was during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the days of Murrostorstai.
Besides, Finland's most powerful bourgeois government is now in power," says Siiäinen.
The present coalition of governments is still interesting in that it is so strict in the right despite what the Finns have said.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time.
Several thousand protestors are expected on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly shuts down day-care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of employees, it can become the biggest in years.
In recent years, some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations in the Ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though policies have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict, are law-abiding.
The protestors are trying to avoid damage to or destruction of property," says Siiäinen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of protest changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on them.
The strike of firefighters lasted three months in 1998.
The pilots and air traffic controllers also had spectacular strikes.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical strikes of the 1970s
The most significant strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
Seventy thousand metal men took part in the strike of the metal men.
The strike was suspended by a settlement commission motion after seven weeks of strike.
The metal guys got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power cuts across the country.
Murrostorstai 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20 000 people, many of them unemployed by the recession, met in front of the Parliament House to express their views on work.
Firefighters struck for three months in 1998
Firefighters strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the fall of eggs when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siperia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
To Espa, the farmers fell a ton of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses struck for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been on strike in 1983.
The strike in 1995 was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and carers' mass redundancies in 2007.
The threat of mass disbandment was finally a catalyst for the outcome of the negotiations.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Doctors on strike... under duress," was the slogan of strike doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted for about five months and gave rise to a lively discussion on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students marched in favour of student support from Senate Square in Helsinki to the Parliament House in 2013.
C.I.P.D. is looking into the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help with the investigation of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, in Aisterheim, near the German border, the Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
All the people in the truck were in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility are at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Crime Police.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling by lorry in Austria were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by asphyxiation.
According to the Finnish Broadcasting Company, which first reported cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant activities, among other things, and its CEO is a man with a foreign background, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for smuggling human beings.
A captain who beats refugees, a former drug courier and a rich businessman... the story of five smugglers.
He's a loaded king of smugglers, a violent boatman, a stylistic missionary, and a cab driver who thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people are smuggling human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book Death Travel Agency is published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present human smuggling tentacles, suggest solutions, and present smugglers on different steps of the business.
HS will introduce five of them.
I'll kick their ass right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia are not attractive to foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling, since the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 kilometres away.
By comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a chain-burning captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
Emir has already done so hundreds of times with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If you fill a boat, you can fit 40 people.
Emir makes about 8,000 euros for one trip.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis struck again.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given in such a way that customers can barely survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that is their problem.
We're going to the water at midnight with a switched off lantern.
On the first night we drive off the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves of 20 meters, passengers cry and vomit.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour, and Emir is on his way back.
Emir wants people to be afraid of him.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims he's gonna beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that when the police caught sight of him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers one by one and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
I hear he's gonna have to beat his countrymen up for this.
I'll beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge right now.
Just a regular cab driver.
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter engine is pulling its last, and he's seen the best of his days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves at all and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
Men who travel without their family in the woods around the city centre are staying in tents, lava and abandoned cars, which is what everyone has been able to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an application for asylum in Serbia.
Some also stay in private dwellings, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the territory of Bogovaða, the great node of human smuggling, people are dead tired.
Goran’s drivers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say it once and that's enough," Goran says.
He says the Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
You're a silly, silly, silly, silly little thing all the way over here.
First the price is set at 300 euros, then they count it to 200, and finally they offer 150.
Goran insists on being a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and only charges EUR 50 per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
It's about a hundred miles, most of it comfortable on the freeway.
I hear colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50 000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for a smuggler, but it is a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and shakes away.
The Work of Loneliness
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary, and that is not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many religious refugees from the Congo are visited, as well as a small center to help Congolese children’s refugees.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He sees himself doing the work of loving - kindness.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underpants looks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV, and his three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer starts by calling one of the Missionary’s five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money gently, and slouch among the merchants crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, we must tell them that we come, for example, from war zones in North Kivu and that we have had to flee our homes from violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary arranges a new identity for the customer.
The old I.D. will be destroyed and another will be replaced.
That's where the Missionary contacts with the Ugandan police help.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to the NGOs, eventually to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges for each step separately: it costs about EUR 100 to submit an application to the Ugandan police; it costs approximately EUR 150 to process documents to the humanitarian organisation; and it costs EUR 4 500 to 7 000 to move to a European country for example.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom's a rookie smuggler, an ex-drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on call on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks headed to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan driver in London, a French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know that they are in the human smuggling business.
In the night, Tom and the cab driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near Calais city center.
They're driving the A26. They're trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been on drugs for seven years.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck, and we have to make sure it's on its way to England, not Holland, for example, and cut the safety wire on the cover.
We have to do it quietly so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's in on it, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, a similar one wrapped around a roast or baked potato in the kitchen.
It should stop the police thermal scanner from picking up the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver won't catch any stowaways, at least not before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Mummer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Upporka the Turk has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal invasions of the Mediterranean, which dominates maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only needs the money when he gets there.
One of the new methods is the luxury boat scheme: Turkish ports rent yachts to take American or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In reality, the ships are being loaded into a crowded area of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and EUR 7 000, first from Istanbul to a port and then from there to Europe by sea.
Customers are kept in human stores, such as old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, you must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship is swimming, for there are no other signs of the crowd.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük will receive approximately EUR 53 000 for one luxury ferry journey after costs.
He does not do practical things on his own, but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, lodgers and other smaller workers to do the work for him.
In the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are organised and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have bought land through undercover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Mummer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, apparently, he's gone missing.
Corrected 16.9.2015 at 3.10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published here, not next week.
An American Olympic runner tells of his book About His Sickness and Become a Prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in excellent shape and ran in the competitions for the second best time.
In the finals, however, he panicked.
From the outset, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership position in a manic race.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the surface of the track, and other rivals passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I pushed myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself was under tremendous pressure of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of making money for having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on a luxury life.
Another explanation of Favor Hamilton’s becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline spikes he had when he competed in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton discovered that he was suffering from bipolar disorder.
The dual life of the former star runner was revealed at the end of 2012 when Smoke Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the world’s number one in statistics at 3.57.40, but was the last in Sydney’s Olympic final.
The world champion rejoiced when the union disciplined Norway’s ski rooster: “Direct-backed”
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been wringing an athlete's agreement for the whole summer and autumn, just like last year.
Even though the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the world champion and the Olympic winner.
The Norwegian Ski Association decided to exclude Northug from the world cup of the coming season.
The decision was commended by two world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put the ski rooster in check.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Association and Northug is about money.
Northug obviously wants to be part of the national team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Mr Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also take care of future generations and will not allow one athlete to go solo.
At the same time, he pointed out that Northug had been granted financial and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he assured us that he would like to play in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, two of them gold.
He was in Falun last winter on a team that won the message gold.
The plate day of the roast translators is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On S.H.I.E.L.D., 25.9., there will be stunts in various restaurants and shops, which have been granted the roast translator's shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for going to a restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the plate as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but that the top restaurants that have been inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention given to the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in Restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
An Old Town restaurant is taking part in the plate day in Kokkola.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the most important international events in the organisation, which will take place in the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland continues to host the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: Complaint to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of the Kauhava reception centre
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre at the premises of Kauhava’s former garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Oy, is still in permanent location.
Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has also not been explained when preparing the reception centre, says the newspaper.
The case states that for the last two years negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and on the arrival of a possible foreign operator at the airport.
The matter has been discussed with the Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence Arto Rädy.
The individual informs the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a matter of principle against the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
Kauhava City Board dealt with the reception center issue last Monday.
Niinistö: The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions," Niinistö says to journalists in the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at their official residence in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern about managing the refugee situation brought all the participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues in confidence.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the Russian and US activities in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful about the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also overlooked in the discussions.
The President did not comment on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts closed for a couple of hours

Finavia is told that the operations of airports will be managed by the supervisory forces during the work stoppage.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
The demonstration closes the streets of the city centre
A demonstration on Friday will close the streets of central Helsinki.
Police report that the streets leading to the Railway Market will be closed off from the cars around 9.30-14.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, no cars are allowed in the direction of Kaivokatu, Postikatu and Töölönlahdenkatu railway station.
From Unioninkatu Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Railroad and Metro Staff informed the STT this evening.
Most of the Starts close for two hours, including posts closed
Friday's demonstration will also cause disruptions to Posti's services.
Significant delays can be expected, for example, in the delivery of day mail.
Most of the post office service points are closed.
The blood transport of the Finnish Red Cross is carried out despite the strike.
There is also an attempt to manage food transport, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples.
Information on situational services is available on the Posti website.
Most of Finland’s Alkoi will close their doors on Friday for two hours.
The service trade union Pam has instructed her employees to stop work between 11 and 13.
Pam has also called on employees in the grocery trade to take part in the demonstration of trade unions.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanomat that they are trying to keep the stores open by supervisors if necessary.
According to Kesko, no information is yet available on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki Day Care Centres partially closed
The Helsinki day care centres do not function to their full extent on Friday, reports the Helsinki Office for Early Childhood Education.
Due to the demonstration by the trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres, and club activities in kindergartens and playgrounds will not be organised.
Day care centres and groups of children with mental disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The ECEC promises to report further changes to the activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Cowfish takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication needs diverse channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio talks are one channel among others.
This kind of direct speech channel will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time," Sipilä said to journalists in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister’s TV and radio talks become a recurring practice.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be passed on to Yle in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires television and radio to be given to citizens.
This dossier, which we are talking about here, is rather complex and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up on this channel. Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent from 9:05 to 21.20 in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it in the Yle Arena.
I'm afraid the cipher is taking a big risk.
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä’s television talk will not tell about a more general government’s introvert.
Is it an attempt to take the right to define public debate more strictly into its own hands and to refuse to discuss questions in public?
It reminds me of the recent comment by the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues are not linked.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media is indignant at Sipilä's announcement.
It'd be weird if the media field didn't react.
The media styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
It is the responsibility of the representatives of the media, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
Koivuse says TV talk is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, the pig should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there more of what we have heard today?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it extraordinary time.
Even the commoner will take the risk in that sense, if it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be labeled as a media of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interests or the general line.
A Shrewd Bet
What the Prime Minister does not say is also important in future speech by the media researcher.
In the evening we should look closely where Sipilä is missing and not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuutti, the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipilä, as this allows him to bring out his own vision without gravel sounds.
This will bring the message to the general public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The cipher passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret the speech because no specific questions can be asked.
According to the moon, it's very important how Sipilä appears on TV... whether the sweat is leaking, the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä knows how to put things right, it can work.
The situation is different from that of a government telling something because here a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly engage in.
That's very unusual.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires extraordinary means," says Railo.
The researcher believes that this is how the Prime Minister wants the Finns to be sympathetic to the blackmail that lies ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organise demonstrations and strikes against government action.
Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech.
Antti Rinne (sd.), Chairman of the SDP, again announces that he is challenging Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy has been found and the son's father updated his Facebook page.
The Police Department of Inland Finland also confirms the matter to the Evening Journal.
The boy went out to play around 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all the people who helped me find him.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent fad of young people: You create hatred
A Kurdish-backed free fighter, Makwan Amirkhani, released a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to young people with immigrant background.
Mr Amirkhani made a strong speech against the street fights of young people.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that he received a message asking him to look at an Instagram account.
There are videos loaded into the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed with the young people's fad.
The 26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking down on the ground, sitting on the other one and hitting you blindly without thinking about any of these consequences, what will happen when you do this kind of videos, Amirkhani updates.
♪ Hard to defend anymore ♪
Some of the young people on video are from immigrant backgrounds.
According to Jarmo Heinonen, Inspector of the Helsinki Police Department, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people in Finland.
The very fact that you're fighting all over the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants harder here in Finland," Amirkhani from Turku reminds me.
Amirkhani points out that there are sites in Finland looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have come to a very high degree.
A little hard, boys, to defend you no more.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be quite a long time strangers here.
That's a slightly different way to thank you for being here," says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever fall victim to some kind of racism, you'll have to blame yourself.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a source of money for racism.
You make me hate something I don't like.
You're in pretty bad shape anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
GERMANY pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, on Twitter, says that the employees' association will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, STTK announced that it would submit its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, believes that the Government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest association of employees (SAK) soften its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, made a brief comment on the matter on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with this on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that agreements by active parties are needed instead of coercive laws.
Mr Lyly points out that Mr Sipilä's government's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä closed negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit itself to a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: "It feels a little funny to shake a fist"
It's kind of funny to shake a fist if you already have a settlement paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
Atmospheres vary in wage and salary camp from side to side.
Is the government going to scream down or even settle with it?
On Monday, the federal leaders of the SAK expressed holy hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with catching up.
The threat spread to the Akavals.
The Teachers' Trade Union (OAJ) threatened to close schools and kindergartens.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or day care centre is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd) was amicable.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk).
Mr Sture Fjäder, President of Akava, hastened immediately to announce that his settlement papers are ready.
At first there was no sound from the SAK office.
President Lauri Lyly (sd) finds it difficult to agree when the federal leaders just Monday told the country to stand up on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the lock on the labour market".
In order to create a joint proposal for wage and salary earners, SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity leap as an objective.
No wonder Palola STTK has relations with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of Palola, Jukka Idealus, Director of Social Impact at STTK, used to be a special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
As Palola described, the government's ay-skills have been improving all along.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took off a little bit from the Finnish seismics, whose figurehead is the ACP Marko Pierainen (sd).
It's kind of funny, if you already have a make-up paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergey Naryshkin, President of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In Ulan Bator, the capital city of Mongolia, the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun, at which Naryshkin made extensive comments on the Helsinki Festival in July.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced into the European Union to come to the meeting - a matter of which the President reminded journalists.
According to our assessment, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again. Naryshkin stressed according to the news agency Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also against the United States, where his access had been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation was able to make it easy, so Naryshkin continued Finland's stinging with praise and praise for Mongolia's 'excellent organisation'.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already spoken to the Russian delegation at Ulan Bator.
The lock meets the real playoff troll: "The paints are tight"
Astara and the Clave will continue the bull's day in Haka Forest today when both of them are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no actual paint party in Haka Forest today.
Last night, Samara visited Kuopio for a 3-2-continuation victory over Kalpa.
The rise was manly, for last season’s silver group was at its worst from the defeat position of two goals.
The Tuesday of the Clave was more minor.
There were round zero points for the Rauman prey, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Lock Attacker Janne Lahti anticipates arrangements on the club's website.
The Sanomara has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumars.
In fact, in the last two seasons, the Tapara has just dropped in the semifinals of the Clave.
Both times a decisive seventh game has been called for.
Last season, the Clave took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tatara rose to the next three arms and past.
There are no major changes in the formations of the groups except for the goalies.
The cashiers who rejected both of them yesterday are getting a flute shift today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski between the Clave poles.
Viewpoint: A bad play going on in Aces
Sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone screened Rocky, where he himself played the lead.
In a sensational way, the underdog struggled with the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola scripted Pori's restless Cinderella story.
Unnamed and wood-handed pottery progressed to everyone’s surprise at the SM finals 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was White Indian, Pori's Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut the irokes.
The Toivola became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the winning silver.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The screenwriter Toivola believes that this season's renewal will work in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director of Ässi has built a pottack on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been hitting guys in the trough like Rocky's pig carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen have the merit of playing something other than the reel.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI the lead is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crucified Iron Rock as Sean Connery.
Rautakallio is as clumsy in Rocky as Connery would have been in the original work of 1976.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock but a nickname.
The game philosophy of the Iron Rock does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates the hard play, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, the Garret Stafford of Äss took a hit on the head of Tatara's Jere Karelian.
He got 2 to 10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only have those who deserve to play.
I don't approve of that kind of game, and it's not part of the ace puck, and the hot Iron Rock snapped after the game to the people of Satakunta.
This season's team is strangely built.
There are kids, veterans, policemen and promotions.
In practice, there are no key men of the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last season's events affect procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather limited, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
It's smokin' under the surface.
In 1953, Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
Ace balance in the three league games of the season has as many losses as the goal difference of 1-6.
Toivolan shouldn't have written a sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuukka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of her husband.
Yes, I'm playing the mother of a friend of my husband's.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but for the first time Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanna's film "You Made Us Beautiful" is "Sipe Santapuk's mother Cricket."
Cricket tsmaps and supports his son, even though his father Ricky (proposed by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, Sirkka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two of them have come much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
Cricket's been really helpful.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, Cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be slightly colored.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna was going to be the biggest band in Finland.
There was a depression in the '90s, and it was really lame.
There was a pretty low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Cricket had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuukka about his youth even before the movie plans.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been somewhat different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola’s notorious skateboard story of known Tuukka.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with Tuukka.
At the most, he could have been secretly attracted.
Olga says he's been working with Tuukka so much over the last ten years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything's always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to shoot at Heinola for a month.
True, the couple in Lithuania often plan to drive home for their young children because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over Heinola for a month.
They have received us so warmly, asking only which streets and when will be cleared out.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play film in Finland
The budget for Timo Vuorensola's film Iron Sky: The Coming Race is EUR 17 million.
The shoot starts in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola begins filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's sequel, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive drama film with a budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been at the Big Game of Jalmari Helander.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being done, will also rise past Iron Sky 2, because the budget for the film is over EUR 100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, starts in October near Antwerp in the AED Studios premises and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the giant budget.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I feel so relaxed about the script because I know exactly what it's supposed to be like.
Everyone in the task force seems to realize that we're doing something we've never seen before.
I love going to Belgium.
Just because time's tight doesn't mean there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, she'll tell the Evening Magazine.
Originally, the budget for the film was set at 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big story.
However, 100 million would be added to the film, because every angle and effects are so expensive.
Now it's all twisted so tight, there's not one loose one.
On Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The action film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
What do you mean, hillbilly or cool?
Big logos go back to shirts
Lately, big logos have adorned the fronts of trend setters.
Not long ago, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising a hoodie or a T-shirt brand was seen as a bit of a hillbilly.
But times change.
Sport has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sport fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, the line between the funny and the trendy: if something's right, it's starting to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, where trend setters surprised by preferring as dull basic clothes as possible as a means of separating themselves from the mass.
Instead of putting on a grey basic college, we are putting on the sweatpants that are buried at the bottom of the cabinet, with the manufacturer’s logo in front of it.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas’ recognisable track sweatpants, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees caps have made a return to street fashion.
Calvin Klein logos on the bottom of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sport to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace’s fall sweaters makes clear the mark of the garment.
Would you be prepared to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician released the evidence: I didn’t get stuck in the tank for hours!
It was claimed that a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove Zotov from the large tank door for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything in his power to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook site where he seems to be peeking through the hatch of a armored vehicle in a very good mood and, at least, based on the pictures, it is not a matter of being stuck or angry.
That's nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the armored car. It was the assault tank BMP-3.
I myself am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served on Ural.
I went inside, looked around and came out in peace," Zotov said to Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I didn't get stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army TV channel that he was admiring Russian new technology at the exhibition because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage. I was admiring our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even at the next show, I'm definitely going to visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was no such thing.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm tall and crooked, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere, didn't happen," he said to the Russkaya Sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of alleged stuck persons have been published, even though 50 000 people visited the gun show in a few days.
The argument about Zotov being stuck started in the first place on the Bloknot.ru site, where Zotov was told that Zotov struggled out of the tank door when he tried and threatened to finally shoot everyone around him if he didn't get out of his grip.
Later, the Bloknot site published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers gave their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours," said exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The purified process water from the gold mine has been leaked from the so-called richshika basin to the ditch.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the leak.
The pool is filled with enriched and purified process water that is neutralised by the foaming process.
In general, the water is either pumped to be reused as process water or passed into the environment through a surface casting field as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material leaked into the environment.
The bleeding was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
No structural damage to the dam structure of the basin has been observed.
The company says that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report published today by the International Monetary Fund follows largely the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation was struggling with structural reforms covering Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and for unemployment benefit.
According to Chief Economist Pasi Kuoppamäki of Danske Bank, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
There is a lot of sympathy in the IMF's assessment for the government's actions, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include infrastructure investments," says Kuoppamäki to Economics.
In the IMF's view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
Danske today, in his new forecast for the economic cycle, expects growth to fall to zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had some of the latest sightings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a slight increase in GDP in the summer," says Kuoppamäki.
Again, less attention has been paid to the weakened trust in industry or to other so-called softer indicators.
However, the differences are only a few per cent of decimals.
Nintendo, recovering from death, appointed a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of the successful Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is no big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, assessed by Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima’s task is to take Nintendo strongly into the mobile games, but not to eat the company’s bread on the traditional game consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants are lost every year on their website, including SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
Juha Kannelma, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there a similar situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear in a "under country" year?- In 2013, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made in Finland for unaccompanied minors.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelma says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and is potentially of an adult age.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were subject to a lapse decision because the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so that 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year," he says.
Is there an increase in the number?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for unaccompanied minors.
Overall statistics on minors who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of applicants for minors is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of persons who have disappeared, he stresses.
What will happen to those who have taken the decision to convert?
Do they also disappear into the "black labour market", for example?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Minister of Interior Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants.
He has taken action.
On Monday, the Orpo, who discussed refugee issues at the EU Home Ministers meeting, announced practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of the equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen for TV and radio productions by a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to sickness attacks is now on sale.
Mikkonen’s spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced professionals in the field.
The first one to tell about the online announcement was the online magazine Evening Makasin.
Today, much of the equipment has been left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programs for Betacam tapes are no longer being filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that interested parties will be found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move out of his current home in Stormylä.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I've slowly begun to inventory and see what things are being abandoned.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no use for TV and radio devices anymore.
It is clear from recent strokes that the man who made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Stormylä.
Traffic is threatening to go to worse ground than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The drivers of the metro and trams decide today whether they will expand their efforts in relation to Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration on Friday.
During the afternoon, it will be decided whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief confidence man Pekka Hirvonen says he's a big player in the field.
The cuts in nighttime and shift supplements are a serious pain for drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the allowances are a source of opposition.
Hirvonen wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and tram stop by Friday, public transport in the capital region is virtually completely stagnant.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
There will be no local or long-distance traffic on Friday.
Trains leaving before 6 a.m. will be driven to the stations of destination.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pit.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning.
Most likely a small number of buses can be driven, driven by superiors, says the HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly which bus runs on Friday.
Employees’ organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Market on Friday between 11 and 13.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports the Associated Press.
Sky News says the refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water cannons against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought it was a bomb.
In the United States, 14 - year - old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after the teacher considered the homemade watch he brought to school a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that all he wanted to do was show off the proceeds of his electronics hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being handcuffed to a juvenile detention cell.
At no time has Mohammed been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, there's still a chance the boy could be accused of making a fake bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police found that the watch looked like a movie bomb.
The watch is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished for three days' forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the case and the American-Islamic Council is wondering if the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain's roaring - Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticisms of the right-wing press have also been shared by the members of the Corbyn Labour Party.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday’s memorial service, the British Air Force pilots ’ battle against the German Luftwaffe was respected in 1940.
In its official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown his respect to the pilots by taking part in the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement stressed.
The election of Corbyn as party leader has divided the ranks of the Labour Party.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with radical views.
Mr Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, an end to austerity measures and an increase in public spending.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is due to appear as party leader in Parliament during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
At the turn of the week, Cameron was on Twitter about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The reason for the Minnesota family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
South Lake Mintonka police have been investigating the family murder in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five was found dead in her home on September 10th and a couple of days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days.
The family was found after the school was concerned about the children’s absence.
Based on this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection and found the Short family dead across a huge house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
The investigation into the case of Michael Siitari, police chief of South Lake Mintonka, is still ongoing.
The motive for the acts of blood is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In 2014, in an interview with StarTribune, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've had 50 buy-outs made over the last ten years for the company.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to put into practice.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, in the fact that the Short family bought a large house in Greenwood in 2011 for two million dollars.
In Zillow, the house is advertised as a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered a variety of prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no abusive comments had been removed from Short’s website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered me a cup of coffee.
In addition, the three owners were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great. Loiri commented with a good spirit on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100 000 euros.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused by the success of Fabrice Duo in the big race.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, a successful horse’s coach, Raven, will have full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri.
An amazing gesture from an NHL star - "The greatest athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens’ superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about EUR 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital report, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising activities for the next seven years.
Subban made an eight-year and $72 million deal with the Canadiens a year ago.
So Subban's donation is significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban will receive a lobby that bears his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have previously contributed significantly to local hospitals.
A year ago, long-time captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another city’s large hospital to get the necessary PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order a wife at a Japanese cafe for the evening - serve the food just in bikinis and an apron.
Theme cafes are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat cafe on the market, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a hug shop, and now a wife's coffee shop.
It strikes the lonely, the courtship, and the hungry.
There's a news report from Metro.
You can order a wife or husband for the evening from Ore no Yome (My wife) in Tokyo.
It's a waitress pretending to be the client's spouse.
The "half" is selected from the list before entering the café and he prepares and serves the food.
She's just up against an apron and a bikini on, and her husband's in tight bike shorts.
The website provides all information on the length of the wife candidates and always puts pressure on the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector," says Intel's press release.
The Board consists of top security experts from around the world.
AsRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections to standardise best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report in the future on the basis of the research results of the ASRB.
The international ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in traffic will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve car safety," says Chris Young, director of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model has been waiting years for the moon to rise.
Finally, the car is also beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford released R.S. data now that the car world's eyes are on the Frankfurt Car Show.
Ford’s new four-wheel drive RS speeds up in 4.7 seconds, thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350 horsepower engine, from zero to 100, with a peak speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
In Finland, the price is also interesting, but it is estimated to be EUR 52 000.
The car can already be ordered, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not state in his press release.
The favorite brand Kia introduced two new features in Frankfurt's car show - such is the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia plans to catch a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market, is certainly more important than the two new developments in Finland.
Sportage, created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Design Director, is more circular than before.
The axle spacing and the external dimensions have come in an inch here and the car is more efficient than before.
The overall range of engines is unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are told closer to coming to sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, because the new Sportage will arrive for us in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimats will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand-new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
Optimums with 1.7-litre turbo diesel and 2.0-litre petrol engines are at the start.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT comes alongside them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
At the same time as its arrival, the sale of the Optima farmer begins.
Chisu's back on the stage. He's in a brave jumpsuit.
Singer Chisu is at the Life for the Child concert with other Finnish stars.
There's an impressive open neckline in an electric blue pantsuit.
It's a beautiful costume that presents the delicate waist of a singer's star.
The whole is crowned with a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During a three - year break, the mother - made singer has lost the weight of pregnancy with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one year.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
I'm not really nervous about getting back on the stage and getting up in front of the public after a long break.
I've missed all the music-related activities, the singer tells me.
Chisu will release his new and fourth album in a few weeks' time called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style is astounding again - now you see the breast
Real TV beauty Kim Kardashian talks one after the other.
She's showing off her baby belly and breast equipment in sexy clothes, last night at one o'clock in America when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left their husband Kanye West's job.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breasts.
As the flashes flash, it reveals the skin - colored bra under the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazonian maternity costume, he visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The outfit was highlighted by black over-generation boots.
The third special maternity outfit is as fresh as last week’s Friday, when there was a pregnancy stomach on the tour.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to take a shortcut to the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary about Talking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine put together six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you were in the last season posing in top designer costumes, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the business, competing for a job with cons.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year to accommodate a hotel room or apartment in which fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
An agent in New York may ask you to drop a few pounds, but then in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is a risk all the time.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are always together and act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference will be sad.
Models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are consumed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a show of clothes.
Even models want to be their own people.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models last night at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their next year’s collection.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays Antti Lautala, the founder of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta band.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but resigned in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I've never wanted to meet a real Antti before, because I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Clearly, Antti is the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's all right that I'm just learning his style of playback from the video.
I don't want to make an impression on a person.
The man who pilots the Scrooge Salminen and the Dogs band is not going to be in the role.
Punk-managers come with a man by nature.
I'm sure a lot of people in the punk episode of "Stars, Stars" saw a preview, too, if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been small-minded, it always goes to the fullest.
The leading actors in the film "You Made Us Beautiful" by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in 1993-2004, were released today.
The core group, known to the audience of the band, is presented to the general public by young actors who are still quite unknown.
Drumper Sipe Santapukki plays Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen tipped off his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already published on Instagram yesterday a picture of his new look, which he has had to implement for the film.
Scrooge, seen earlier in the mustache and chin beard, has shaved his face into smooth cheeks and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents in recent days have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to enter Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to force this issue, a member of the SPR crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
It is worth protecting smaller children, not allowing them to watch the news alone, for example.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed," he says.
However, if a child has come across television news pictures of refugees or heard about them elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent imagines he is afraid of.
You don't want to scare a child in vain, even if you're being distressed and scared.
A smaller child closely monitors the behavior of his or her parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child also feels safe.
Larger children are likely to run into discussions about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents do well to bring it up with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Together with the children, parents can consider how our family views this.
But, in the end, do we think that the world is a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational viewpoints - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if you also talk about difficult things in your family, your child will find a model of how to deal with the difficulties in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weaker"
You're out of your powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
It's hard to control the ball salami that hits the Vermo.
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind the Clover Ball Salam into a blow in the middle of the summer.
It was only racing profits and second positions until the collapse of the Tampere raves at the end of July.
Since the stallion was completely frozen, the coach suspected that something was wrong and ordered a period of protégé from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the blackout was found in the endoscopy.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not of the mildest mind, but it took two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Clover’s ball flash had to be on light exercise, the Nordic Region says that it is positively surprised at the horse’s last run.
It was the second SE in Turku in its record time after the Taruntuuli.
The clover’s ball flash was under great pressure from the break when it had only been able to drive normally for a few weeks.
Taking those things into account, it was understandable to bend at the end," says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that the stallions got a kick out of a good race.
The horse must have moved on from there, and hopefully it would have settled.
Clover’s Balllight has been called humorous horses.
When you don't feel like it, it could have thrown you fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallions have lost such a throttle that their opponents have been amazed.
At a short speed, fellow competitors can't compete with Balllights, which even sheds warm - blooded rides.
There's a race in Vermo.
However, the difference is how the Clover Ball Flash agrees to it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it's like, you know, you know, you know, you could go under the boom and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku left.
The clover’s ball flash can also come out of the bow when it’s in order, and we’ll take it for a win, coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of useless iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple is possibly going to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future," says Tim Cook in an interview with Buzzfeed, the company’s CEO.
Apple’s iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime calls, Journal kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips, for example.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which came as a forced upgrade to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says that removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to someone else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it, because the company does not want to waste memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, i.e. by 0.1 per cent year-on-year, according to Eurostat today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower prices of energy.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate a little downwards from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, the rate of inflation was 0.2 per cent.
In August, so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0 %.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU 28 was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
In August, consumer prices rose most in the euro area, or by 1.4 per cent.
Cyprus had the lowest inflation rate when prices fell by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains persistently far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a price increase close to 2% over the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates in its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
US Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin in less than a year’s time, but it will be more likely within three years after the country’s central bank, Fed, resumes its long-term interest rate increases.
And in the financial markets, the decline will begin before the next recession.
Fed has suggested that he will start raising interest rates, possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can hit its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market exchange pace before that.
Or at least this will be the case if the world's largest economy and financial markets operate as they have done - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money interests as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s London market research strategy Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive long-term market and economic cycle study.
The Bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies that produced the study and the report do not think they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after Fedi’s interest rate increases.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now on the same or different model as at the time of the previous interest rate increases - and what might result from it.
It becomes clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more fragile condition to withstand rising interest rates than ever before since the 1950s.
Maybe not a year to the beginning of the recession.
Fedi’s monetary policy and its current stance have been led by leaders throughout last summer and early autumn to suggest that the time is getting ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase to over nine years could be this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Board of Fed meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The last time Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but small interest rates of 0.25 percentage points, with which Fed raised interest from 1.25% to 5.25%, ended for exactly two years.
In 2007, the financial market started to suffer from the most risky housing problems in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis torn into a global doomsday nightmare.
The major recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started at a slower pace than has typically occurred since the previous Fedi interest rate increases.
Similarly, the trials were harder and tougher than ever since the depression of the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategies have screened the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the turn of the financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.
From the 1950s onwards, they will report on Fedi's interest rates and their economic and financial impact.
The time since the start of the recession is less than one year, mostly less than three years, and on average less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in the financial markets has ended within one to two years of the start of Fedi's interest rate increases.
Since the early 1950s, Fed has alternately increased and reduced its steering rate by a dozen cycles of different dimensions.
Each time has differed from others in some respects, and the times are relatively limited, so it is hardly possible to determine the effects of the subsequent interest rate increases.
Indeed, the strategies point out that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interests too low for too long
The crucial causes of the financial crisis, let alone those responsible, may not be undisputed even by decades of research.
But there are three factors that have led to the crisis and have contributed to its destructive power:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks considered their key interest rates to be too low for too long.
They were patching up techno bubble tracks, and they were growing the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive debt to different parts of the financial and real economy increased even more as a result of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The biggest debt bubble in the economic history of the past was born.
3) In particular, crazy debt financing, which was almost imprecise in the financial economy, increased the biggest exchange-rate bubbles in the financial market to date from shares in real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor is there much controversy about the fact that the financial markets, which had risen to higher levels on the basis of ever more complex debt levers, were in an exceptionally dangerous and unstable state when Fed and other central banks last drove interest rates up.
Financial structures geared to debt, let alone valuation bubbles, did not last until after interest rate increases had started and the cost of debt financing had been reversed.
Risks materialised as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not speculate on what will happen next, but give cause for thought by, for example, mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now kept the stance of their monetary policy even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) For a long time debt has not been crazy cheap as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden in the financial and real economy has not been lightened, but is now considerably heavier in various parts of the economy than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the central banks has mostly remained in the financial markets and has been the most expensive of key types of securities and assets since the peak or ever before the financial crisis.
And not only do the strategies flatten the mood with the warning signs of the financial markets, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades of the heaviest recession to the model that has been the case in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but the pressures and risks of the financial markets are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts tightening its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, the strategy of the French bank Societe Generale, is not as strange as it may seem.
For some time now, he has trained international investors in Fed to turn around as follows:
First, Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for Fed to run off with even bigger QEs.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) who manufactures computers and printers plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the deductions are directed to HP Business Services, the company says.
In November HP will be divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which focuses on consumer PCs and printers.
HP had the highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring costs of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion).
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be reduced to 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3300 in three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company says that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers is responsible for more than 10% of its operating results.
Even the other year, its three main customers imported 65 per cent of the operating result.
iOS 9: Apple publishes a new operating system – this is how you install it on your iPhone
The new operating system can be installed first by selecting Settings, General and Software Update.
If the phone is ready for the upgrade, it will tell you to download and install a new operating system.
Some users have had problems since the installation: an error message has appeared on the phone "software update failed".
In the event of an error report, users are advised to wait for congestion to break down or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide you in the charging process.
The upgrade may require the removal of applications in order to free up space. However, Apple has made the upgrade more compact. In addition, there is a tool that proposes to remove applications and install them again after the upgrade.
When updating the software, you should make sure that the phone is loaded and that the charger is available so that the power does not run out during the download.
If the charging level is too low, the phone will not allow you to start the upgrade. If your phone battery is empty in the middle of the upgrade, the update may be broken.
Read more: iOS 9 will be released on time despite the delay of WatchOS iOS 9 review: least exciting but best update iOS 9: Be ready for iOS 9
It is also worth preparing carefully before downloading the upgrade package to avoid any upgrade problems – and protect the system against them. iOS 9 brings new features such as a more intelligent personal assistant and plenty of new features for the iPad, as well as small improvements that speed up and improve the operation of the operating system.
Yle: Minister Berner has worked on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (central) has been a member of the Board of Directors of the tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities are related to so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Business Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Board of Directors.
Berner himself says that he submitted his resignation in May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to file a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains take place within the agreed time frame," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with the Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs Board of Directors and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings are carried through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was contacted for a partner found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a venture investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context," Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not associated with tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up in the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg for the purpose of ownership.
Espoo offers a reception centre maintained by the company
The first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers will be opened in Otaniemi, Espoo.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants today, starting from the evening of six.
The number of seats may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service establishes a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is the production of health care and medical services in particular.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agree on security arrangements for the Centre.
STTK is preparing an alternative labour market blackmail package
STTK will start preparing an alternative package for the government’s work-related blackmail.
The association also wishes to involve other employee centre organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday," Palola pointed out to journalists during a break at the administration meeting of the organization.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) does not, on the other hand, have the capacity for discussions.
STT’s economists have calculated that the security of the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared with 2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party is awfully eager to have a conversation if you're about to have one relationship with 100.
Palola: Negotiation has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) has requested alternative proposals by Wednesday, as the Government is due to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a dialogue with the government, and it has always been constructive to him.
According to Palola, the cutting of Sunday supplements is a painful place.
The organization requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation to implement part of the blackmail.
According to Mr Palola, the STTK does not welcome the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP, which has presented the issue.
Employees meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the employment blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the wages of the first sick days are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to take part in a demonstration and that the intention was not to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks
Mr Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, commends the STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now taking the same line with Akava, as Akava has been planning an alternative model for government proposals for a long time.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package will not be comprehensive enough.
Mr Sture Fjäder, Chairman of Akava, hopes that the SAK, chaired by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to the cuts.
Earlier on Wednesday, Antti Palola STK reported that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Akava announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate a 5% competitive leap by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long been working on an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the country's government and employers," Fjäder says.
The Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle's channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's last speech, we must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech marking the beginning of the end of Mäntsälä's rebellion.
After that, the President and Ministers gave several radio talks during the Winter and Continuation Wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year’s address instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operator strike with a television talk.
Single call, monarchistic action.
All day long, Sipilä’s speech has aroused criticism and speculation about what is to come.
On Twitter, Paavo Arhinmäki, Chairman of the Left Alliance, stated that "Siplä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow discussion of the speech".
According to Green Ville Niinistö, "we've already seen a single call.
Leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned "monarchistism: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for them".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What's @hivasipara afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Sipilä’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented live by the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, and Jyri Häkämies, Managing Director of EK.
A lot of people have been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it was a public service mission to promote the publicity of the whole of Finland, the director of Yle's publications in Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
♪ Like us in Tammel time ♪
The speech has also aroused ridicule.
In the evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed for their best.
My mom's gonna put on a prettier hat, and my dad's gonna try on his neck.
At 9 a.m., we will be silent on TV as we used to be in Tammela's time," writes bloggari Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who draw up amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claim to the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" says Pia Lohikoski.
From what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has published a bingo page on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the same coal, the same debt, the same team spirit tonight?
Ready the coupons and pens, it starts at 9:05 p.m. and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: the Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to overthrow al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to renounce power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian U.N. ambassador proposed a plan for Al-Assad to take a classy step away from power after a while.
However, the Western countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed three points for him in a bilateral debate: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and al-Assad's abandonment had to be carried out in a contained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree with everything, but we can talk openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what to do," Ahtisaari recalls in the Guardian interview.
Diplomats No Comments
Ahtisaari says that he has delivered the message from the Czech Republic to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the debate, but Ahtisaari said that there were no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but they said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time and that the main opposition groups refused any agreement that would have left him in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about what Ahtisaari said, because, according to his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke under Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me what Cherkin said, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep control of some of Al-Assad's supporters.
The Refugee Flow — Our Own Things
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I see no alternative but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum seeker's organization centre is going to Tornio.
The asylum seeker organisation centre planned by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in an empty Tornio joint lyseo building in the city center.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
The Helsingin Sanomat announced on Tuesday that the council would have already decided to present the school building as a solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left) Vice-President of Tornio City Council, this is not the case.
When the whole council was not here and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on it, he specified to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43 present at the conference.
13 delegates objected to the Organization Centre.
On that basis, you could expect a positive decision, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and a rapid response was made.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers could be accommodated in the joint lyse.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is about 200 meters from the border, so it would also be functional in that sense," Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail from the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally), half of the holiday money in the public domain would only cover part of the government's efforts to reduce the cost of work.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if the social partners manage to agree on such a package.
Sipilä told journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for substitutes for the blackmail of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be a way of doing so, as it would target almost all employees in contrast to the Sunday allowances proposed by the government, for example.
Labour market organisations could agree between themselves to cut holiday money because it is enshrined in collective agreements instead of the law.
The Government will tell Parliament next Wednesday about the blackmail of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final deadline either.
Legislative work will then start to take place, i.e. the train is on the move and it will become increasingly difficult.
There's plenty of time.
It won't take long, if there is a will, for the Sipilä to formulate.
The list published by the government last week includes the conversion of the Epiphany and Helatorstai into unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working hours.
In addition, the wages of the first days of sickness are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as a coercive legislation past the trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
In addition to organising a major demonstration on Friday, a number of trade unions have announced political strikes.
The Tohmajärvi Council approved the extension of the Mahlahall warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy hall, which is a bit murmuring.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than originally talked about.
Also a busy schedule with heartburn.
It was also a little surprised that the need for space was not known a year ago when the last extension was decided.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of between EUR 150 000 and EUR 200 000, but at the meeting the technical director, Erkki Ikonen, said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings jobs and tax revenues to the locality.
There is no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) explained.
Karelian language in Joensuu
The City Government eased its previous firm position to bring Karelian street names to the city centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the preservation of the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of Karelian language, because there is no historical basis for it and the Karelian language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the eastern Savon dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street names in the city center.
However, the City of Joensuu is also prepared to use Karelian language on a case-by-case basis, for example in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a broad-minded approach to the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism lives and changes strongly in North Karelia.
Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both of them can well be used in the various marketing activities of the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the province's vitality with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the regional economy and competitiveness.
And that makes it possible to live and work here at all," says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also raises the issue of air transport, which has also been followed up on several occasions in the report.
It is important for the region as a whole that we should not be able to manage by means of government measures, as is now happening.
We should look at the effects of the closures of these transport links on employment, for example," Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of accessibility poses an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport connections also affect the faculty, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland because of weak cross-sectional connections.
Approximately half of students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
In contrast, around 10-20 per cent of them are from New Zealand, partly explained by a direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of the gravel sound of Siu's war
The Joensuu City Council’s view of the regional Siu social project is apparently unanimous, but one of the gravel sounds is also included.
Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured) of the City Board member at Monday's meeting suggested that the whole project should be abandoned, but his proposal was unprofitable.
The Board approved the decision proposal by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give the final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one train crew.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train crew is left out, but still five times a day gets from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state austerity measures.
The purchase money for rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely cut off.
VR will prepare new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.

There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
It did not stop a group of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others swerved from the scene and passersby alerted the rescue department to help with the tow ladders to help the last one safely left on the roof back to the surface.
Variations in FedEx's turnover, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its low performance in the last quarter. The transport industry’s output forecast was weakened throughout the year due to reduced demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50 000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
The share of the company decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trading on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and 10.90 for the financial year ending in May, with a decrease of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has deteriorated despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent. The increases will come into effect on 4 January. Additional charges for the land transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The company still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in e-commerce.
The president and CEO, Fred Smith, noted that the company has performed well in a weaker economic situation than expected, which has particularly affected production and global trade.
The plans for the recruitment of seasonal workers were communicated the day after the competitor UPS announced plans to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 people.
In the quarter ending 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means an increase of 6%.
The earnings per share were $2.42, leaving the forecast of $1.44 for the 12 analysts at Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, the turnover was expected to be EUR 12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has been hit by a reduction in international first class transmissions, which has caused the company’s Express unit to be stagnant.
The strong growth in e-commerce has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed higher costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on the freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the actual trading opened, FedEx’s share price had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended up falling by 11 per cent from the average of the year and by 17 per cent below the highest quotation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the Federal Reserve Fed meet for the most anticipated meeting in years. A group sits at a wooden table of eight metres in diameter to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A wall painting of the United States on the wall of a decorative, two - story conference room in the central bank.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the financial interests of the State ahead of all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank's management has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This mandate may be a missing piece of the decision, and on Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to begin the withdrawal from the unpredictable stimulus offered by the short-term interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent turmoil in the financial markets can cause the officials of the already cautious central bank to falsify the increase in volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate – even by one percentage point in a quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are of course the first and most important for their practical follow-up", says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist of Banker Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if the Central Bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty of the global market will give sufficient cause to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who have wondered do not agree with what the central bank is going to do, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economists in a Bloomberg survey were concerned about the rise in interest rates this week.
However, in the financial markets, the Central Bank is expected to wait, and according to the main indicator there is only a 30% chance of raising.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, the stock prices may fall unless the decision-makers soften the blow by promising another withdrawal.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average defected 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
"The outlook for the central bank to keep the interest rate stable this week was the background to the flash," said John Lonski, chief economist of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank were to raise interest rates at this stage," he said.
"If this were to happen, the Central Bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of those operating in the financial markets without shaking."
The second expert said that raising interest rates would help to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank would operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be tilting to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Mrs Yellen has said that she has been waiting all spring and early summer for interest rates to be raised this year – despite the fact that, according to the Liberals, economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, which is now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank will calculate as full employment.
Wage income seems to be picking up.
Although inflation continued to fall below the Central Bank’s 2% annual targets, the central bank’s decision-makers noted that the main reason for this was the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them as long as it takes account of the tight labour market situation," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , financial markets worldwide did not startle last month when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that the Chinese economic downturn would also have an impact on global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has already fallen by nearly 10 per cent from the peak of May.
The turmoil in the market means that the decision-makers of the Central Bank are even more complicated to consider how to raise the steering rate.
"The work of the Central Bank will become more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news of the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks", UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate senior researcher and former Central Bank official Stephen D. Olier said.
He now believes that the Central Bank will wait at least a month to deal with the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information on the situation following recent developments in the Chinese economy," said Oliner.
The consolidation of the world economy is not the central bank's main concern and should therefore, in principle, not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential body in the world monetary economy.
The impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from the then President, Ben S. Bernanken, that the central bank could reduce the scope of its operations caused upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring developments in the world, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The central bank's decision-making process is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial movements that do not seem to be linked to the fundamental pillars of the economy.
Mr Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (Federal Market Committee), has called for the steering rate to be raised, as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in Asia led to the central bank deciding to reduce the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings, although there were only limited identifiable consequences for US economic growth," Mr Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank overturned the decision.
"The Central Bank should give priority to monetary stability only in a major crisis, such as the collapse of the 2008 economy," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England's Interest Rate Committee.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching the situation at the time," he said.
"There is no reason to be afraid of raising interest rates because of the shock of the market," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Until this changes, I do not think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazilian Association of Rio Grande Pediatricians Promotes a Good Diet for Breast - Feeders
The Brazilian Association of Rio Grande Pediatricians SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach nursing women the meaning of a proper diet, showing them pictures of babies breastfed with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which gives the baby all the food he needs and allows him to develop a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 kilocalories.
In addition to increasing calorie intake, a new study suggests that other changes in diet should be made.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet can affect the baby’s genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven's Sunrise is the biggest spectator, even though Nine is trying to catch the lead on his Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson asked Canberra to do a morning program on the aftermath of the Liberal Party's leadership elections, which, however, did little to improve today's ratings.
The Nine Channel morning program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytage piloted the competition channel morning program from London. Special broadcasts of a week’s duration are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the gap was not relevant to Australian television viewers, since Sunrise had an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals of the state, while Today had 339,000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000) but remained on last Thursday (343 000).
Today has narrowed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
Here's the most interesting event of all morning.
The winds of change will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had a 800 Words news series with a former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached an amazing 1 219 000 admissions.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough to be the star of the hit series alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1 136 000 spectators. The series blighted the block (838 000) and the TBL's Familias series (726 000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
Andrew O'Keefe’s new series of quizzes from the first half hour (17.00-17.30) followed an average of 446 000 spectators.
At the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the audience reached 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, The Chase in the first half of Australia had an average of 520 000 spectators, and the other half gathered a huge 720 000 spectators.
Hot Seat's admissions were 620 000.
The Chase Australia's second night admissions showed the Nine channel that Hot Seat will pass at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final three think that Sam Wood really is the bachelor of the Dreams – but who does the man choose?
Did the secret come out? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of the bachelor of dreams, Sam Wood, has been a carefully guarded secret.
The three remaining women do not say a word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked about Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before they dropped one of the three. Women could inadvertently hint who would be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's finals.
All three women excite that Wood is the perfect man, and the women praised his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positiveness, and considered him to be a match for himself.
When asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not hit its own spot, their answers could indicate who would take the bachelor’s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything's been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"As soon as I came into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit together well. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has feet on the ground, and she's very funny company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are good partners.
Mackay told me he realized on a hometown date last week that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this isn't just a race. I'm betting on our relationship now," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, she mysteriously replied:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much as you do Snezana and Lana.
The bachelor of dreams on Ten on Wednesday at 7:30.

Jarlyd Hayne has a number of options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after she moved to the United States. Several other clubs also became interested in him after the impressive open day last year.
Hayne picked San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like it hit the jackpot.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as the man was in the ranks of the Australian rugby team. Hayne fucked up the kickback after the team won the win on Tuesday from Minnesota by reading 20-3.
Tomsula, however, showed her confidence in Hayne and gave her a second chance to return her flight kick, and the coach kept Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued her line in the locker after the game.
He didn't rush the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly defended Hayne at a press conference after the game.
Cam Inman, a special editor of 49ers, reported that Hayne also received encouragement from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarlyd Hayne is making a mess of the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fans had been expecting something else from his NFL debut.
After the failure, Hayne left the field, raining and later told Hamish and Andy of the 2DayFM 104.1 channel that he could not have imagined a more miserable start of his NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the error to her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when her pitch in her own area opened a place for Queensland.
However, the experience as a whole was incredible for a 27-year-old youth.
On Instagram, Hayne published a picture of her posing with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at an airport in Siberia.
Openly, Khodorkovsky, who challenged President Putin, was convicted, Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was liquidated and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead policemen shot with rubber bullets protestors in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, a source of officials reported on Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets at a mob in a demonstration that was allegedly unconstitutional in the country, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area, less than 200 miles [360 km] from the capital of Kathmandu.
According to district chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1,000 protestors gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired on the air before the rubber bullets were fired.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not quite clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but which are generally considered to be a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of prolonged protests in the southern Nepalese plains, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new constitutional provinces would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands a state of its own.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent conflicts since 10 August,
It is an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very sensitive subject in Nepal, where the administration has been centralized for centuries.
The new Constitution has been being worked on since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week and the authorities say that a new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
Within the next 48 hours, about 560 km of the vast area of low pressure from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands, the possibility of developing a tropical cyclone is 60 percent, announced by the National Hurricane Center of the United States on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear center of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles. It can also develop into a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
Google's going to raise $11 million for the refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leadership, the campaign was launched by a Google employee named Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when she fled Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and we starved, thirsted, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
As the European refugee and migration crisis escalates, many families in similar situations desperately need help.
Donations are allocated to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN Refugee Agency.
Once donations have been collected at google.com/refugeerelief through $5,5 million, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount, reaching an overall amount of 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is at its worst since World War II, which is particularly exacerbated by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has led to more than four million people fleeing their homes this year.
The war is also being fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to a new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics will live longer after obesity surgery than those receiving non-surgery treatment.
“It takes time to get the death data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes. However, the majority of the studies have been conducted in patients with a pathologically overweight body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
The BMI indicates the weight and height of the normal value between 18.5 and 24.9.
When the body mass index is over 25, the person is overweight and the body mass index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own body mass index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and sleeve surgery, to treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
After obesity surgery, the mean body mass index decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index of those treated without surgery remained close to 29.
In patients treated with surgery, diabetes improved completely by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partly by only about 2%.
The study also showed better blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol in the surgical treatment group.
The investigators also monitored haemoglobin-A1c levels in patients, which reflect the development of blood glucose levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is less than 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the drug-treated group, the value remained unchanged at around 8 per cent.
However, a study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu concluded that this did not reduce mortality over a period of five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgical procedures.
In the fifth year in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher compared to the sleeve surgery group (18,7 and 14,2 kg), the fall in the body mass index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as was the decrease in haemoglobin A1c levels (3,1 % and 2.1 % respectively), and diabetes improved completely in the bypass surgery group with a larger proportion (46.9 % and 16.7 % respectively).
The new study failed to show a lower mortality rate after five years. According to a Swedish study by the Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, however, surgery brings years of life to obese persons.
In a Swedish study, the probability of death for obese persons undergoing gastric bypass surgery was reduced by 29% over 15 years compared with the conventional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone nevertheless confirmed that persons with a BMI below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it says that surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking things seriously," said the researcher.
"When the human body has accumulated genetic changes that predispose to obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
The European Union is not capable of receiving all the refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
The Dalai Lama dealt with the refugee crisis during its visit to the United Kingdom. The Dalai Lama delivered its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis, although admirable, is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said the Dalai Lama.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is a wonderful thing to do, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to be considered and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," said the Dalai Lama.
"In the end, we need to consider how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
Powers have never solved problems," he added.
In his speech on violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the 11 September terrorist attacks and claimed that, in responding to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrollable chain of events.
"After the attacks of September 11, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would be through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to forces with unpredictable consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Hand-on swallowing cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Poison Centre in Georgia, poisoning centers across the United States report an almost quadruple increase in alcohol - high hand - ingestion cases in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Poisoning Centre in Georgia, hand-in-hand swallowing cases reported to poisoning centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 1,6 117 in 2014.
"These products are becoming increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some children are going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handicrafts on purpose, part to impress their friends and part to stimulate social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant because of cheap drunkenness.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcoholic mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of handmades.
"The child doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"Most of the attractive handicraft products are just scented.
Strawberry, grape and orange-flavoured handmade products are available that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
Even a small number of young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"Handides' alcohol content is very high", the medical director of Kansas University Hospital Poison Center Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a shot of whiskey available to children, but if hand disinfection products are often left available to children, they quickly get a high amount of alcohol."
The six - year - old Nhaijah Russell recently enjoyed four rumbles of strawberry - scented handicrafts in school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice as high as the adult hop limit," says Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated her from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah swung up and couldn't walk when they brought him to the emergency room.
Doctors watched the girl’s condition overnight in a separate children’s hospital for brain damage, as she had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol,” Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
My daughter could have been killed.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and alcohol wipes in addition to your handing to children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting handicrafts containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the product contained fatal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter was declared as active substance in the product fiche.
According to the police report, three fourth - grade students in the north of New York state were planning in January to kill a "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products all over the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handicrafts and banned it from being brought into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that had gone down was meaningless and called for disciplinary action by the school.
Rumour mill: no discord among Celtics
Griffith downplays the Celtic team's discord, while Deila admits that everything's not good for the team, but he thinks he can fix it.
Hearts buttons against the SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton is wary of January's player transfers so the team's unity won't suffer.
Aberdeen's neck to Celtic five points
The first half of ADAM Rooney's sentence brought Aberdeen a limited victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen to a five-point runaway from Celtic.
Griffiths downplays the talk of disunity.
Griffiths has ignored the rumours of discord in the Celtic ranks, and according to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under observation when preparing to meet the Dutch serial leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are waiting to meet.
The Dutch yearning for an old Scottish battle partner – de Boer
The former Rangers’ middle-fielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has noted that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has fallen, as the two battles between Celtic and Rangers are no longer allowed to follow.
De Boer, a leader of the Ajax team, said: "There are no more highlights in the Celtic games in Holland.
'Cause the Rangers aren't in anymore.'
"It's not just about the Rangers coming back.
We're talking about Old Firm.
The Dutch need a team-to-team fight.
Old Firm’s games have enormous tension, and they are also of interest outside the Scottish borders.”
I'm turning things around, Deila assures me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is going through a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures us that there will be a change.
The club lost to Malmö fell from the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," said Deila.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is so frustrating, and it stirs up anger or grief in many people.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need the support of the Celtic supporters, which will significantly strengthen the players.
The collective spirit is now very important."
Warburton Careful in January’s player transfers
Although only a few weeks ago the Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted about the transfer targets in January, he is cautious about the transfer routing and says that he wants to compromise the team's unity.
"The transfers of Tammiku players differ significantly from the transfers of the summer," Brentford's ex- coach said.
“The players joining the team in the summer can be used to the team before the start of the season, which this season has succeeded in our composition.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player purchases can cause more harm to the team than good.”
Michu, who is thinking about retirement in Celtic’s sights
The Swansea attacker Michu has been attached to Celtic in player transfer speeches. Michu, on the other hand, has hinted about retirement after the end of the Swans agreement.
For years Michu, 29 years of age, has been plagued by an angry ankle and failed to obtain a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready to fight SFA from Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team finally lost 3-2. The defenseman's red card was later revoked. It is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be revoked.
But Neilson will stand by his words. "I didn't question honesty. I didn't comment on performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle.
Griffiths was reprimanded when the man admitted to blasphemous lyrics about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at the pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local game coming up, and the mood was intense," the attacker said, "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
Tannadice’s management team believes in Dundee United’s coaching management – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that Dundee United's leadership team can turn things around, and we can't allow them to be handed over in the field anymore.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy with Hamilton winning with a dirty game.
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to hold on desperately to Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league victory, and with victory, Aberdeen grabbed a five-point neckline in Celtic at the top of the comic book, which is to thank Adam Rooney for his punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British Islands
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July. There are 164 000 unemployed, while in the United Kingdom as a whole the number of unemployed increased by 10 000.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
There are 12 000 fewer people working in Scotland than three months earlier, and the number of people working is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the United Kingdom as a whole having an average employment rate of 73.5%.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs, David Mundell, commented on recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: unemployment has fallen.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will be sitting in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man’s best friend, and despite my shock, I answered yes.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you a true story about the death penalty.
The view would be unique.
Journalists are allowed to follow executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than seats, participants are selected by a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of reporters from 12 to 5.
The chosen will follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with him, because we've been talking on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits lasted two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
According to prison staff, I cannot be present both as a witness and as a journalist, so I am not allowed to take along a notebook and a pen to take notes.
All I have to do is try to memorize the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him."
I gave the reporter my dissident opinion.
The reporter lady admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but she still thinks that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to tell me what to do, I wouldn't do what I say.
I have told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist to write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he will believe that publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, editor of Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of accessory after the crime.
I believe, however, that it is very likely that the man Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
You can read a neutral description of other reporters' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry when he lured the man up from the Canning River.
The Perthian man’s attempt to escape was stopped in shallow, muddy water, and the police a few yards away managed to get the man back on the ground.
On Tuesday, the Canning Vale police received a call about an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they found a suspect who tried to shake the police off by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water said he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec was not tempted to water his uniform, so he chose a safer tactic — negotiation.
"Sometimes the attempt to escape causes a person to resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing a cop and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man’s attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design Ben Cousins.
According to Peter Moody, the trustees tried to spy, and he threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria's operatives of attempted espionage in his stables last year.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by the trustees and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, and the rejection of Lady Tatai for the treatment recently given on the day of the race was the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always working for racing. Moody has been in a difficult situation when we found cobalt in Lidar’s sample and he was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue in check over the espionage charges for a year and a half, and he did not want the accusations to seem like the actions of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up, I was thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration erupts once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I must now accept the condition after I opened my mouth.
I'll go home and sleep well at night.
I want to go upright, and I want the owners of the horses to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe in it, then I'm no longer the horse coach.
I'd have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told about the attempts to spy on the integrity department in his garage.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my garage to spy on my actions. I'll tell him his name when I asked," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught for anything illegal.
Former Chairman of the RVL Robert Roulston, current Chairman of the RVL David Moodie and current Managing Director of the RVL Bernard Saundry were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I view the situation as a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and assume responsibility for the situation in the sector other than the coaches?
Am I bad for the business?
Am I really bad for the business?
Maybe that's what a lot of people think.
Maybe I'd still get a training license and push me out of my duties, but there's no doubt that what I'm talking about makes a lot of people think that way.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'm pressuring them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long study of Lidar’s cobalt values and the recent rejection situation made the coach frustrated at the end of the day so that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable champion Black Caviar, who described the day of the race as ridiculous after a clay wrap was placed on the horse’s feet in violation of the rules.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for it," said Moody.
"A person of my staff misplaced clay on a horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday afternoon, and it did.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month non-compete ban on non-compliant clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," said Moody.
Arrested on escape from Cobram's crash scene.
The police have arrested a guy on a biker this weekend who ran away from the crash site.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, who suffered serious injuries when the car hit him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man driving the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Sheppard police.
The man is likely to be accused of neglecting the obligations of stopping and assisting in a road accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old biker from Cobram is still in hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy refers down to opponents' wrestling speeches
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy regards the criticism of his team’s tackle game as a purpose-oriented activity of the two league favorites of the NRL.
According to Sydney Roosters' coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm a wrestling match to the masters of Melbourne to win a qualifying match in Sydney on Friday night.
Dr. Wayne Bennett, coach of Brisbane Broncos, barely covered up the reference to Storm after Broncos won the finals at Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a model match and stated that Queensland did not care much about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his own team's tackle game and said they just focused on the contact while they were hitting it.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was increased by the fact that two top team coaches criticized his team. Bellamy sees this as an indication that coaches are concerned about losing to Storm.
“This thing always comes up. I remember Trent Robinson didn’t say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24–2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything in our defense system or technology all year long.
Trent's been on the job for three years, and the loss could have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It's funny that the same thing always comes up at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting about football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett’s St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about an interesting football.
He compared his own team’s Saturday game to our Friday game and found their game interesting,” Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St. Georgea received a lot of criticism for her boring game. Wayne said that the criticisms won't take him a whiff.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast-trackers.
That's the kind of football you want to play when a player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play with his style. Not all teams have co-defenders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
This gives me more confidence when the other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they'll resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored at Storm and Roosters than at Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The end result of our game was between 20 and 18. We had more situations, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breaks and low-goal football interesting?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be visiting North Queensland Cowboys next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale on Tuesday morning.
A Serbian man free for a $200,000 bail in a drug case.
For the 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, a man awaiting a possible life sentence has been released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who was arrested last month after the police found a hundred kilos of cocaine on the Solay ship, which had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Comera in August.
The police watched the meeting of Maksimovic and his accomplice at the marina for the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse.
Although Maksimovic may be awaiting life imprisonment for possession of a drug for commercial purposes, according to his lawyer, there is no evidence that his client tried to get the whole lot in his possession, but that he could have been at the café for innocent purposes.
According to the Supreme Court judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has connections with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about where he lived."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200 000 bail against which he was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man from escaping," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily and stays home from six o’clock in the morning to six in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get access to photos of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged in to an online message service where he got another user to send out inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, the girl noticed the phone was missing and she found it sleeping in Hogg’s hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, she found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
These five images were reported to the police. After checking the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search words to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed that he was trying to mislead paedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a cop with the purpose of scaring pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson at Dundee Sheriff Court said: "The man claimed to be addicted to intimidation.
He admitted that he had done the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so in order to act as a policeman and thus intimidate the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead pedophiles.
He told me that he had had some disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "After finding the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother, shaking and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, then Hogg was questioned.
The girl told me that the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road confessed to possession of inappropriate child images on 14 June last year. Hogg violated his bail on 25 January this year and failed to appear before the court on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be included in the sex offenders’ register, since it can be considered that the crime did not contain any significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October because of the background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but he was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sexual offenders even before the date of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gives the wrong speech in Parliament
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest head of state, fell down the stairs leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe wasn't injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by the arguments of the opposition legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MEPs booed and interrupted a speech by interlocutors on the situation of the President's state in Parliament, and the President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) bishop Innocent Gonese noted that seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is entitled "Death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns the recipients that outside the House they are no longer immune.
According to the party’s bishop, the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving of the business services business.
HP is divided into two listed companies later this year and separates computer and printer business from faster growing business hardware and service operations.
According to HP's release, the company records non-recurring expenses of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter of the year.
"Reorganisations will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said HP's CEO Meg Whitman, who runs the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than the current HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business activities that will help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As a company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is over $50 billion, and the company will focus its mission on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company, founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is now divided into two. The duo founded an electronics company in the garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
The HP has undergone massive reorganisations as traditional desktop computers are moving into mobile devices.
Changes in the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and in HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest in a sector where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Captain Mikel Artata of Arsenal: The team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the airport as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere is bound to miss at least the next four English national team games, and knowing his history, his participation in the European Championship is clearly unclear.
The main regret of the latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season after a severe ankle injury and seemed to have returned to his former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can come when a player tries to return to the field during the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of troubles since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played for Arsenal in only 65 of the 157 league matches during the last five seasons.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007-2008, the team has been the second of the teams losing the most money due to injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improved injury statistics last season will continue to improve.
"Sometimes, a return after injury may be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time when the body needs to be strengthened and competitive," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope he can balance his body, and I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal will begin his career in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare for minor changes in the composition.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite successor to the F-group, Maksimir Zagreb has one of the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games for the team.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday night, as the earth trembled with power on the 3.2 Richter scale.
The earthquake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his lesson since the last season, having had to turn to Monaco, and is still motivated by the distant desire to pilot the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"Arsenal hasn't hit this title yet.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I am also a realist.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series, which is noteworthy, especially in view of the greater need for men to open up than ever before and the highest suicide rates for young men in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK. Suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 men's year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed, and according to the study, the chances of recovery for those suffering from depression are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of illness among asymptomatic persons was also halved if there were persons close to them who had no mental health problems.
But it is all based on friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and the communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The values that come from the outside, money, image and social status associated with superficial success, all of which take away attention from our inner values and our natural longing for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently noted that money really cannot buy happiness.
The great thing about the Friends was that the show turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession, but by personality, which was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously performed with Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football in their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often longing for Rachel. It was clear that men could relate to this even though they did not refrain from knowing each other fully.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, it has become clear to me how much the slightest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should survive is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendit is one of the series of long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were emphasized.
Through the phone I can offer help from outside at a moment of despair, but long-term support comes from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set has been revived, so if you're going to attend this weekend, you might want to take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can be.
Comedy Central will send the whole Frends series – all 236 episodes – in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring a goal against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the offensive when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by beating Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored a goal after the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She strengthened the position of the French champions immediately. However, PSG screwed up several goals before finally being able to increase their lead: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
Also in Pool A are Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG is not only looking for a sequel to the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarterfinals in the remaining three games.
Although the SPG caught the score, the match was not a perfect performance for the team piloted by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal seat and the man was replaced when faced with his former home club, where the man began his huge career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or at guests in the Champions League, so 2-0 wins and good grips give us a good basis, even though we still have something to make up for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We wanted to win, we could do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after being injured. The team had to settle for a 2-to-two match in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. Di Maria, however, left Ibrahimovic out of control at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian dock, which moved from Manchester United to the ranks of the PSG, was named a PSG solver, who raised the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the nomination by speeding the ball from Marco Verratt’s pitch past Malmö’s defense and then fired an exact hit on the back corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
However, those waiting for PSG’s crushing victory were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players on the field from the start. The team playing with five men's defense and two attackers' tactics was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot went by the back of Kevin Trapp's goal for 34 minutes. The team didn't attack very actively.
On the other hand, the PSG fell into unnecessary pitch and weak finish, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. Immediately at the beginning of the second half Ibrahimovic’s kick fed the paint to the rear of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic pointed his fingernails at the pitching game, and Di Maria fired a spiral kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was made at the Count's time thanks to Cavan, and the sixth-round Uruguayan shot a full shot when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö’s cleavage ended in another goal, and only Wiland’s top defense guard, David Luiz’s close - range shot, kept the readings in check, and Ezequiel Lavezz’s goal from the bench was abandoned at the very end.
Malmö's pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in its own category. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the level is not the same.
The tests aren't enough.
Hats for Parisians.
This was their top game."
Glencore will raise $2.50 billion at the stock issue.
The Swiss mine giant Glencore, who was hit by falling raw material prices, raised USD 2.5 billion in Wednesday’s share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, stated in his statement that it had sold new shares to a value of some GBP 1,6 billion to reduce debts.
The company's market value decreased by 57 per cent this year. The company is grappling with the collapse of raw materials when the Chinese economy's economic downturn hampers demand and puts a strain on the market.
With the share issue, Glencore’s share price hit the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday for the beginning of the morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 p.m. in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to a 0.69 per cent increase.
Last week, Glencore announced its intention to raise 2.5 billion dollars in the share issue as part of a strategy to reduce its 30 billion dollar debt by one third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 cents, which is 2.4 per cent of the price of Tuesday closing.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99 per cent of the Group as a whole.
Concerns about the continuation of the Chinese economic downturn have led to half of the iron ore price collapse, while the fall in coal, copper and other commodities has been between 20 % and 40 %.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
A communication published by the White House on Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping is travelling to the United States on a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping will arrive at his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, a counter-visiting visit by President Barack Obama to Beijing last November.
Following bilateral discussions between the Heads of State and Government, the President and wife of the United States, Michelle Obama, arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and her wife, Peng Liyuan, to celebrate the state visit.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping will enable us to extend cooperation between the United States and China in a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping will have the opportunity to engage in constructive discussions on issues that are divided", states the White House's Communication.

Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and stated that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
In the HBO Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, an experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained how important it is to take into account the different views of the project for the black main character in the selected manuscript.
"Diversity is taken into account in film casting, not in programme casting," Damon claimed.
Brown was shocked and offended by the argument. "Wow, that's all," she said after Damon's comment on the film "Lone on Mars".
Damon and Brown had met with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrely brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is the director, I would like to encourage you to think about how the Harmony character will be presented," Brown said at the outset.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as film directors. Damon harshly replied that choosing a twosome could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was broadcast on television, the social media exploded from Damon’s disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the scene in direct terms: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks on the only black person to explain what diversity is is is so white that it hurts."
The tweets were distributed over 5,000 times, and they liked it 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with a time when the balanced representation of human races in the media is a topic of first speech.
After a teenager Michael Brown died of a white cop bullet in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement gained support throughout the country. The movement aims to stop the discriminatory treatment of lawmakers and authorities of blacks.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement when presenting the year's album candidates at the Grammy gala.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and black people's lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published an opinion in response to the Fow News’s question by Elisabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group should be described as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group based on love," said the management of the movement.
Damon is one of the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if Damon has said yes.
American Ninja Warrior first winner
Professional climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed a million dollars for his victory.
For the first time in the seventh period that just ended the TV series, all the tasks assigned were explained.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
In the final task, men had to climb up to 23 meters of rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first competitor to complete the fourth phase of the American Ninja Warrior race successfully, but Caldiero did it three seconds faster and won.
After a tough fight, Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after catching a million-dollar pot.
"The winnings are incredible, because I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an E! interview about his jackpot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine the consequences of this, the future is completely open."
The corresponding producer, Kent Weed, talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finals and why Britten was not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to have worked out all the tasks.
"According to the rules, the fastest winner is the prize money.
If more competitors find out all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
"The money prize is wonderful and revolutionizes life, but Britten is also satisfied with her performance.
I don't think he's gonna stay here and dwell on it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a great deal of praise from the fans.
Britten's a great guy with a family.
His children and his wife think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he preferred to win for Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him the same way if things had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed to the eighth season, which starts in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers squeezed the win out of Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- Detroit Tigers do not have particularly pleasant experiences in the second half of the period.
The Tigers, one of the best teams in baseball, are now in the final position of the American League Central.
However, the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to get up to Houston Astros to fight for another wild card spot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, even if only for one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
"Every victory is nice, no matter how it is achieved," said Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus.
Alfredo Simon, the pitcher of Tigers, stood his ground when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two pairs, once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 shifts of good play and let three runs go.
He's only had three good beginnings on nine out shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for an alternator to throw at every game, and that's why I want to pitch until the sixth shift."
Victor Martinez, who pitched Tigers, got three hits and hit two runs that were his first beat since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-shot night since he got four hits against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He struck well," said Ausmus.
"He looks good in batting practice and kept his foot in the game."
On the second shift of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
The middle captain Byron Buxton started his shift by hitting two nests near the left sideline with a stroke.
The real catcher, Aaron Hicks, beat the sacrifice shot, and Simon took second Brian Dozier, who took three straight pitches before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a free shot at Mauer, and the rookie pitcher's surrogate, Miguel Sano, hit two nests, followed by right-handed Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners in the field, VerHagen got Trevor Plouffen, number three, to burn two players.
The Major League team ran the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit hit the certification run on the first shift of the ninth shift, Tigers’ finisher Bruce Rondon struck a two-run hit, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three straight pitches and was able to hold his team’s position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
Tigers got three runs on the first two innings against a right-handed guy who had just gotten off the list of injured people back to the fields.
"Of course, the beginning was not as I would have hoped. However, as the game progressed, I began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform and pass a few good pitches in the third inning," Hughes said.
When Hughes got in charge, he gave one hive hit the second Ian Kinsler in the first line.
The real catch of J.D. Martinez's free pass brought Victor Martinez the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 streak broke when the team had players in the nests.
Number three Nick Castellanos was next hit by one hive, one run, but Victor Martinez burned down trying to get to number three.
Tigers increased his lead in the second inning, catcher James McCann survived the hit on second base and Anthony Gose to first base, where the situation was three to zero.
"What a hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot."
The pitch was Hughes, who pitched the unpointed third inning, and then he was replaced with his right-handed surrogate A.J. Achter.
Hughes' balance was three runs, six hits, a free pass and four straight passes.
Notable: Tigers' right-handed hitter Anibal Sanchez was not in the lineup due to a blowback.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured people because of a shoulder tear since mid-August, and he was supposed to be on the list on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, left-handed hitter Daniel Norris leaves the list of injured and is in the starting lineup against Twins.
Norris has had between 1 and 1 in four games since he was replaced with a left-handed hitter at David Price on July 30th.
He's been out of the lineup since August 20th because of a retraction of a crooked abs.
Tigers and Twins finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4,43) will face the right-hand pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4,73).
Xi calls for the opening of the economy to the rest of the world

"By promoting a policy of opening up and deepening reforms, a new impetus and vitality for economic growth will be set in motion," said Xi.
The Steering Group approved guidelines, including a negative list of market access rules, the relaxation of border control policy, the promotion of private capital participation in state-owned enterprises and the revision of the system of registration of citizens.
According to the Communication, a negative list of sectors and companies in which investment is prohibited is to be drawn up.
The system will be gradually tested and developed through test programmes.

The government also reduces the control of companies and thus ensures that companies have a decision-making power over their own business.
According to the Communication, China will allow the development of new cross-border cooperation models in border regions and the search for new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The opening-up of state-controlled sectors will open up many sectors to private investment.
