The City of Juankoski joins the City of Kuopio at the beginning of 2017.
Kuopio City Council unanimously approved the merger on Monday.
Juankoski City Council approved the merger last week.
The Municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the investigation of the municipal mergers, but its council decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Kuopio and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the next municipal elections separately.
The municipal elections will take place next time in 2016.
After the accession of Juankoski, Kuopio has a population of approximately 111,000.

The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, will meet his Japanese colleague Shinzo Aben in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, with his first important foreign visit after the May election victory.
Mod's five-day visit to Japan aims to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economy.
Plans for extended nuclear cooperation are at the forefront of the debate.
India has also been said to be interested in a defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shooting civilians
On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the leadership of Kiev of refusing direct political talks with the separatists in East Ukraine.
The current leadership in Kiev does not want to carry out an essential political debate with the eastern part of its country," Putin said according to the news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, who are said to be assisted by the Russian army by Kiev and the West, tried to push Ukrainian troops further away from their current positions, where Putin said that Ukrainian army forces were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the people of the region," Putin said.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Ryrmi Workshop.
It surprised me that people came in from the very beginning of the evening.
There were visitors during the two days as expected, the promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Wall River Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Next year, again.
We're still going to be hip-hop festivals, so there's no pop coming, Kangas assures us.
On Tuesday, Finland enters into force a law restricting the acquisition of explosives.
In the future, individuals will have to apply to the Police Government for a permit to buy or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as starting material for explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate and mixtures containing them if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
For example, hydrogen peroxide is present in detergents and detergents, but concentrations generally do not exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the acceleration drive.
However, starting materials acquired before the entry into force of the Act may be held and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster is charged with hotel rapes in Nairn and Pitlochry.
There's a trial waiting for the defendant for the rapes in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, heard the charges in a hearing before the Glasgow Supreme Court.
He is accused of rape at the Pitlochry Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire province on 7 June 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman in her "in an unconscious state, asleep, and being so incapable of making a decision for herself".
Webster is also charged with another rape at the Golf View Hotel in the Highlands, Nairn, May 4, 2014.
In accordance with the decision of Judge Lady Rae, the trial will take place on 17 November in Edinburgh before the Supreme Court.
Champion League: Super Raheem shone - Mario was overshadowed - Valio League - Evening Sanomat
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed why he is regarded as a hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lane had an electric atmosphere when the stronger Liverpool at Mario Balotelli arrived as a guest of Tottenham.
Super Mario’s first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working in the field with a completely different attitude from that of Manchester City.
The Balotelli was still a long way from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality goals and fed only half of its sixteen pitches to his team.
The pool supporters who have already been popular with the player expect better in the future.
The Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in the role of Luis Suarez, who travelled to Barcelona, as the second attacker of the team alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotelli, the head of the diamond in the middle field was Raheem Sterling, who pushed a 3-0 victory past Hugo Lloris’s important opening goal.
Sterling, 19, it's not just the brilliance.
An Englishman 20 centimetres shorter than Balotelli is between the enemy's lines than a fish in the water.
The property is not common to a player who speeds at his best on the grass at a speed of about 34 kilometers per hour.
Mr Rodgers also deserves a great deal of credit for Sterling's progress.
After the match, the Northern Irishman told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the northwestern London who grew up at the foot of Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I am happy and proud"
The Helsinki City Board has decided to appoint Susanna Mälk as the next chief conductor of the Helsinki City Orchestra since autumn 2016.
The papers down to the Los Angeles Times have been asking which orchestra he'll take next.
Susanna Mälkki says that she will begin her new assignment with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a central role in the music life of our country for over a hundred years, including by performing a large number of Sibelius's music.
The orchestra has been led by the best Finnish conductors and I have worked with many members of the orchestra before.
I look forward to our future cooperation with you," he says.
Administrations of employee organisations to meet in a pension negotiation case - Domestic - Regions - News - Karjalainen
Today, a new impetus is being sought for the pension negotiations from the social partners' own meetings.
The management of employees' organisations SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiating situation in the morning.
After that, the actual pension negotiations are to be continued.
Amongst other things, labour market organisations have been chafed by the dispute over the commitment of retirement age to life expectancy.
The organisations have promised a career solution by autumn, but the latest estimate is that it will be born this week.
Pile-puds.
Women Volley, a female volleyball league team in Rovaniemi, tripped into the league-raiser Vampula’s athletes at Pahtiputa’s training tournament final on Sunday.
The vamp turned one into a three-to-two win over an extended match.
Last round WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was one step ahead of us the whole time.
The fight was good, but in the defense game and passport game Vampu was a little better, saw WoVo coach Teemu Mäkikyro.
WoVo's spruce was broken, so that Jennifer Keddy, a six-foot American centimeter, was stuck on the side.
It was Sara Niemi who played as a senter.
Karoliina Kyllönen was able to play despite her thumb injury and formed the most fiery combination with Johanna Pekkarinen.
Jenna Keskimäki, who started as Hakkurina, was allowed to make room for Jana Jaudzema for the last 1.5 rounds.
The best part of the vampul was a skilled Russian passer and libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo travelled as far as possible.
WoVon's preparations for the league will continue next week as the HPK from Hämeenlinna comes to training camp in Rovaniemi.
The team will meet on Saturday at the "store" at 6 p.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we meet again at the sports academy.
Lidl beats wild figures in Finland

The company released its results on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement will continue.
Lidl also told us that he paid nearly EUR 14 million in taxes to Finland from the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
The company has over 4,200 employees in Finland.
Ovarian cancer is more often killed in sparsely populated areas due to late diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released the video as a tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in Australia’s rural areas are at higher risk of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers reviewed the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% of women lived more than five years after diagnosis.
Principal researcher Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
SMALL INVESTIGATION: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
Scientists went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the survival potential.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread at the time of diagnosis, the probability of survival was lowest.
Women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the survey than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to determine why women living outside cities are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers delayed diagnosis and difficulties in accessing treatment as possible.
"Gynecological oncology specialists treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," says Jordan.
Although remote care is becoming more common and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also suggests increasing the mobility of doctors so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients who are far from home.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, women with ovarian cancer have a poor long - term survival rate regardless of their geographical location, stressing the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old family mother in Gold Coast, Elisha Neave, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen its snowmobile parking activities in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel Pohjanhov.
On Monday, the City Board decided that the proposal for a station plan for the Friendship Park and its surrounding environment will be placed on public display at Osvivia service point.
Statements are requested from the Environmental Board and the Ely Centre of Lapland.
Through a change in the station plan, the city wants to enable the continuation of snowmobile activities related to tourism in the region.
The site is intended to form a park area that includes the area between the current Friendship Park and the river.
Up to 200 snowmobiles will be permanently available on the spot between 15 November and 30 April.
Refuelling points may also be placed in a specified part of the area.
Maintenance services are also allowed for the new park area.
The City of Rovaniemi has rented the area of Friendship Park to safari companies for snowmobile use during the winter.
The tenancy agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and is valid until spring 2018.
The snowmobile parking operation and the change in the pattern have caused even loud opposition.
The inhabitants of neighboring blocks of flats have been snarled by both sound and concern about emissions.
However, emissions from the area have been investigated and no findings exceeding the guide values have been identified.
Modernised equipment is also less emission than the old one.
The park of friendship as a parking lot is also supported by the fact that if the starting point were moved further away, hotel safari pigs should be transported to the starting points of safaris by buses, which are estimated to be 15 departures a day.
According to the city, the area and surrounding area is also large enough for snowmobiles, better than the places presented as replacement points, such as the east side of the Ounas River Bridges by the pier.
The park of friendship is good for its location, too, because in the future the activities can expand to the Ounaspaviljong region, for example.
The consolidation of parking is part of the urban strategy adopted by the Rovaniemi City Council, which states that the city aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally advantageous locations.
The friendship park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiles in the central part of the general plan, which has not yet gained legal power.
The decline in owner-occupied housing is seen in garden shops
The reduction in the number of homeowners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a reduction in the turnover of garden shops by tens of millions, as today's young consumers reach the "main target group" of garden sales on behalf of their age. The Financial Times reported a study by the British Horticultural Trades Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, only 55 percent of the money used by owners is used by tenants for gardening.
The survey also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanised dwellings without gardens, and the size of the garden is reduced as the front yard is increasingly paved into a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be about GBP 5 billion a year.
In a large area of London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where gardening is the country’s lowest spending per household.
However, according to HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), an increase in the rent of dwellings or a reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the leading garden counselor at RHS, says that “for example, plants grown in transplanted containers are particularly popular among tenants because such rearing vessels can be included in the change if necessary”.
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a booming period in the resale of the horticultural sector, as housing ownership and wealth increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will pick up this year due to better weather conditions, after last year's worse weather in March and April.
Turkey is questioning an American diplomat on the basis of an espionage report
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the most experienced US diplomat in the country to report on the report on the US and British espionage in Turkey.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the U.S. Embassy’s affairs manager and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept have written that documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spy of US and UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report by saying that all the major countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the espionage targeted by the German Chief Intelligence Service in Ankara led to a more angry reaction in the Turkish Government.
Cannes winner Croze performs in a new Finnish film
Marie-Josée Croze, a Canadian actor in several successful films, has been attached to the leading lady in a new Finnish film.
Croze plays in director Mikko Kuparinen’s film 2 nights in the morning, which will start shooting this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Best Women's Party in Cannes for her role in the Barbar invasion in 2003.
Among other things, he has performed in Steven Spielberg’s film Munich and in Julian Schnabel’s film Butterfly’s Glass Dome.
Mikko Nousiainen is in the male lead of the 2 nights to morning film.
The film will be premiered in Finland in September 2015.
Chief of Police of Majorca Magaluf charged with corruption
The perpetrators of the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the City Board of Calvià in the Majorca Public Prosecutor’s Office on Friday.
The chief of police in Calvià, on the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested for wet celebrating as a result of allegations of corruption by shop owners and bar owners in the Magaluf region.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was put in custody after several of Punta Ballena’s business owners charged him with corruption. On Punta Ballena, most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, those who made the case presented evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the City Board of Calvià at the office of the Prosecutor against Corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard in connection with corruption charges and are being interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
ABC, a countrywide daily, wrote of the anger of nightclub owners over the partiality of the authorities, which significantly hindered their business.
"It's not about money anymore, it's about survival," one business owner said to the court.
You're not destroying our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in the headlines of magazines in several countries this summer when a YouTube video was distributed online, where an 18-year-old British holidaymaker had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to curb the drunken and uncontrolled use of Magaluf holidaymakers by reducing the number of infamous, alcoholic pub crawlie participants.
In addition, the Playhouse nightclub, where the oral sex video was filmed, was ordered to be closed for a year, and the club owner and pub crawl organizer Carnage were jointly fined EUR 55 000.
Especially among young British tourists, Magaluf’s popular tourist attraction has also become popular with the so-called ‘balconing’ trend, which has caused many alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel’s swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after the Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50 - day Israeli - Hamas war and schools remained closed as the area recovered from battle.
The opening of schools brought joy and excitement to the rocket - bombed southern Israeli communities, but the tracks of battle are still visible.
In Ashdod, in the southern town of Ashdod, at Pashosh day care, workers removed fragments from the walls and slided before the children arrived after the rocket hit the day care centre.
"We are a little scared but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in a kibbutz called Saad, an Israeli commune, and works as an English teacher at a school in the city.
Many children living in this area desperately need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that coming back to school after a long time feels a little weird.
"We've had difficult times sometimes when we didn't leave home," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip to offer his support.
Before the start of last week's ceasefire, thousands of people from border communities such as Saad had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community in the vicinity of the Gaza front are sceptical about the return of the Palestinian grenade after the killing of a 4-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Department of Education, over ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed in alternative schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited school in Sderot, a city close to the Gaza border, which was the subject of heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that “children’s education and safety will be taken care of”.
Israel and Hamas agreed on a cease-fire in force for the time being last Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately halted the fighting, but it did not provide a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egypt blockade and the reopening of the air and maritime roads in Gaza.
Israel wants to disarm Hamas and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who fell in war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no solid evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the side of Israel, including a Thai worker.
In battles Hamas and other Gazaan soldiers fired 4,591 rockets and grenades on Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, on the other hand, carried out more than 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to shelter in more than 100 U.N. schools that had been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still sheltered and fighting continued, school officials moved the beginning of school the previous week.
"I hope that school will soon open up and that we can get back to school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children," said the 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in the shelter of a school in Gaza.
According to a commonly used indicator, house prices have risen most in seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic apartments, which measures the prices of apartments in Australia's capital, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, as revealed by RP's data on Monday.
With the rise, prices rose by 4.2 per cent over the summer, July and August period, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as high as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to RP Data’s research director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the forefront of price increases.
The results of RP Data show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are next highest; the average price increase is from 5 to 6 %.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent a year as a result of government spending cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that started in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on sale in the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the rise in sales of dwellings to be auctioned, the generally high sales rate and the continued low interest rates, it is likely that the increase in prices of dwellings will continue over the next three months," Lawless says.
The new Gösta Museum has led record audiences to Mänttä
The new museum and art have attracted record audiences this summer to Mänttä.
By the end of August more than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has featured classic pop art works from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, Mänttä’s Art Weeks told us that they had recorded a visitor’s record, while 14 500 people had visited the Minute event this summer.
I don't think we've gotten used to these numbers.
People have fallen from doors and windows," says Pauli Sivonen, Director of Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to Serlachius museums this year will reach 100,000.
In previous years, there have been about 40 000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has approximately 11,000 inhabitants.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that new museums are always open to phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
In Mänttä it is hoped that the art season will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
Police are investigating four thefts in Kajaani in the last few days.
On Sunday night in Pohjolankadu a business property was broken down by breaking the window.
Whoever did this had got a small amount of money from the cash register.
Between Thursday and Monday, there was fuel stolen from the truck tank on Syväojankatu.
On the other hand, between Sunday and Monday, the boat had been taken from the boat’s marina with its rear engines.
The rowing boat was white on the outside and yellowish on the inside.
On the inside, it said "OIVA" on the nose.
We've already caught a couple of suspects.
On Sunday night at the Tikkapurontie, there was a break-in at the commercial property.
A police dog got a print, and a man in his 20s was found hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police picked up another man in Paltamo who was also suspected of breaking and entering.
A missing amphetamine brought a murder charge in Kajaani.
The disappearance of less than ten grams of amphetamines brought a murder charge to a man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone into the apartment with his common-law spouse and another man and shot the owner of the apartment he suspected to be a drug exporter, a 34-year-old Caucasian woman.
The defendant denied the charge and claimed that the other man involved was the shooter.
The case came to the attention of the police when a police patrol stopped a car where the company that had been involved was burning clothes used in blood work.
In addition to burnt clothes, a severed shotgun was found in the car.
Kainuu District Court will pass judgment on the case later.
August was unusually warm in many places.
According to the Finnish Meteorological Institute, the same warm August is repeated on average once every ten years.
The statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most parts of the country the deviation was from 1 to 2 degrees.
Due to the heats of July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature during the whole summer was measured in Pori during the first week of August, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says my father never hugged me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born into a seven - child, Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Britain’s Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and the relationship between his son and his father was distant.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
The audio track is a mixture of reggae and rap in upbeat paces.
Henry has had to go through some painful childhood memories.
He has been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he ponders much about his relationship with his father.
Father was very difficult to read.
His face never showed up, just a voice said, "Stop making noise."
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I'm looking at cricket now.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer stand or the beauty of cricket.
I never talked to him about things like that.
For most of my life, he was the smileless man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal smelter in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father’s life must have been like, even though working conditions are now better than they were then.
Melting plants are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoky, labyrinthic depths with flames, smoke, and soot, reminiscent of Sheol.
Father used to take a bath and just lay in the tub, and slowly he began to sing by himself as he washed away the dirt from the melting house.
As I walked around the melting house, I realized that he had been working for years to get us food for the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacked parental intimacy.
My father never hugged me, never said he loved me.
It wasn't until my mother started getting sick just before she died that we started repeating to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter named Billie with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she herself lacked as a child.
Do you have to keep saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why don't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend to French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the causes of the mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from heavy obesity and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to turn around.
After that, I began to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a heavy diet to reduce the symptoms.
It is very difficult —
And boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short beard may be a reflection of his change in career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othello, he is absorbed in the theatre.
Next came the Mistakes Comedy and August Wilson's Fences ("Aidat").
Making a theatre offers a different experience than sitcoms and comedy that Henry has been doing throughout his busy career.
Henry started the business when he was only 16 years old.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and contacted the New Faces talent competition.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s. "For a long time I was the only black impersonator and comedian on TV," he says.
Henry learned when he was working.
I had to grow up in the spotlight of publicity, I had to learn to make jokes on the conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while living leftovers and I was on TV. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces talent competition in 1975
Henry's manager had stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where the characters appeared in black makeup, so Henry ended up being a comedian for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and reprehensible, I was able to work at huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Still, "the award-winning, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program of British TV" was at the same time "a grotesque parody of black people".
Henry worked in another comedy series in the '80s, where both a joke and admiring the black British culture were made.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known, among other things, for his character as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade in advertising, documentaries, TV shows and movie parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv show in the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it looks like you're just walking in your seat or walking on the sidelines."
Next up was Radio 4 documentary series "What's So Great About...".
The first part dealt with Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught properly at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, who wears pantyhose and has money.
That's why I was afraid of Shakespeare.
All the people we interviewed on the show – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me, "Try it.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Go out with words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry spoke 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost seemed as if a part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"This is what it's all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your verse, do a little research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was carried out.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but that was not exactly the case.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the lead in the comedy of Mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, 'You have to do 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.'"
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me sighed with relief.
It's not my duty.
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play. Stay in your role."
Henry "Fences" play at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lines for the "Fences" play was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more durable.
This play was also well received, so it was as a sign from the gods; "This is what you must do."
That, of course, is what Henry will say in a BIG voice.
So I decided to stick to this.
I sincerely love this job.
I love training rooms.
Henry, however, is still basically a comedian: little boys of humor keep interrupting our conversation as he switchs from one impression to another.
Abstention from the Stand-up Committee is a matter of will, for getting immediate commendation from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you want it all the time, it could lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general it doesn't inspire me the way it used to.
I'll ask Henry if he's going on another stand-up tour.
It gives me real joy to sit with the director, who will help shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new reincarnation?
I think so.
I like acting —
It's really funny.
When you show me, you keep telling me a story, and that's what I like to do.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya is drawing up a register of officials to remove "ghost workers"
Kenya has started to draw up a biometric register of civil servants in an attempt to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer receive remuneration, the Government press release announced.
The government suspects that thousands of people will continue to be paid wages after leaving their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to eradicate corruption in the public sector after taking office in 2013.
According to an audit carried out earlier this year, at least one million dollars was spent on the salaries and other financial abuses of "ghost workers".
The government suspects that wages will be paid into the account even after a person has died or left office, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports from Nairobi, the capital.
All officials must register themselves in the next few weeks in the identification centres in order to ensure that their data are stored in biometric registration form, reported in a government release.
According to the notice, any person who fails to do so without due cause will be removed from the payroll.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people actually work in their jobs, and that will clean up the payrolls at both levels of the government, thus solving the problem of "ghost workers", says Anne Waiguru, a private office official of the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The result for the financial year 2015 in Seinäjoki may remain in deficit of EUR 25.5 million unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual margin is about to fall into a deficit of 9.4 million.
Possible ways of improving efficiency were to reduce the scope and level of services, as well as the purchase of services, the sale of assets and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
Of the EUR 10 million reduction target for investments, EUR 8.5 million is available.
There will be no relief in the condition of the municipalities.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient tax revenue growth, rising unemployment and a 5% reduction in central government contributions further undermine the outlook.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into the strategy's objective," says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the City Board.
The City Board returned the proposals submitted to the Management Committee for preparation.
The City Board's proposals will form the basis for the preparation of the budget at the Council's economic seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After the Board of Governors seminar, the budget proposal proceeds through the Board of Governors and the City Council.
Dozens of Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of a plot against the government.
In total, 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspects of "anti-government plots", according to local media sources.
Police didn't comment immediately.
According to Hurricane Daily News, 14 high-ranking police officers were arrested.
Some police officers were in contact with corruption investigations last December, targeting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey on charges of organising a broad criminal code and following telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdoga (who served as Prime Minister during that period) said that police action was part of the planned action against him and others in power by Islamic leader Fethullah Gullen.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally important day for families, and like thousands of Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsnyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the expectant journalists that not all schools have reopened, but he said that he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first of September were not celebrated in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the vast Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexander Pastuchov, a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsynyuk’s daughter attends, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally return here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The celebrations of the first school day traditionally include children’s embroidered shirts, balloons, and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry in Texas, the slandering tweet was unauthorized.
On Sunday evening, a defamatory picture of a Democratic district attorney was sent from the confirmed Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry of Texas in the middle of the allegations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed and followed by a new tweet in which Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was illegally sent from my account.
"I don't approve of the tweet and I've deleted it," the later release said.
Perry's back-up teams did not respond immediately to requests for clarification.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's unclear who posted the photo.
The first tweet contained a reviling cartoon of Travis’ district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry blocked the funding of Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a grand jury meeting in Austin this month with Perry on trial. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet was, "I don't always drive drunk, three times as much, but when that happens, I blame Governor Perry for pointing fingers."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has said that he is innocent and has called the accusations a political plot.
His influential legal aid team has asked the judge handling the case to dismiss the charges and has said that the law on the basis of which the governor in Texas is accused is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry cut $7.5 million in state aid to the state’s department for public inviolability, which operates in Travis County and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Mr Perry's decision led the observatories to make a formal complaint to the left.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After gaining fifth place at the Iowa election conference during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry announced that he would end his tie by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself jogging around the lake with the text "Here Coming, South-Carolina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is "normal" again.
One of the main developers in London has warned that the housing market in the south-east of England has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital city of London has been plagued by huge demand and steep price increases, while the fear of a widespread credit bubble has caused the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgages in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-level developer Berkeley, said that "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market and the number of stores have returned to normal since the peak in 2013" and added that this has allowed a "stability of the environment".
The London housing market went well during the recession with foreign investors flocking to the capital.
According to the land register data, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent in the previous year alone, thus well above the average for England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings rose by around one fifth in the previous year, reaching a rise of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has made London's properties a less attractive destination in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new property tax laws and political rhetoric about a possible "manor tax" before the general election in May.
Last week, London’s real estate agent Foxtons warned that the April mortgage report, which reported stricter lending regulations, would lead to lower market growth both in terms of sales volumes and prices in the second half of the year.
On Monday, recent data from the Bank of England showed that the number of loans approved decreased in July, indicating a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has decreased its forecast for 2015 from London real estate prices, which suggests that prices will fall by 3%, as the price index for homeowners has already started to decline.
The number of transactions made in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen a quarter of the year ago, says real estate agent WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased its income from the sale of properties to over £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, correct product at best locations has remained stable and thus sales have remained high".
In June, the company reported selling 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost one third more than the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40 per cent year-on-year by GBP 380 million and net sales by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting, Mr Pidgley explained that Berkeley’s earnings for the year correspond to current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the profit before taxes for the whole year is GBP 450 million.
In the afternoon, Berkeley's stock sold evenly on the London Stock Exchange for £23.96.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's nude photos online.
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th annual Academy Awards award ceremony.
A hacker who claims to have hundreds of other star photos leaked naked pictures of an Oscar actor Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet.
The representative of the Hunger Game Star confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for "poor violation of privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged.
The images originally released on the 4chan image release page had apparently ended up in the wrong hands because of the weakness of Apple's iCloud recording system. The list of hundreds of other stars being hacked is claimed to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
We don't know how much of the photos are authentic, although Scott Pilgrim versus World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"For those who look at pictures taken by me and my husband in the privacy of our home years ago: I hope you feel good," Winstead tweeted.
However, Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and Victoria Justice of the "Victorious" series denied the authenticity of the pictures and tweeted that "these so-called nude images of me are FALSE, don't you understand."
Let me put an end to this right now.
BuzzFedin announced late Sunday that a pop star from Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures about the star.
It's just that we have an excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and "J"
They dissolved, it pictured what had happened best, they gradually separated from each other like a cardboard box that was left out in the rain.
Only once in a while did he hear from a woman that she was too serious, arduous, intense, detached, and perhaps also slightly thorny.
That's when he waved his hand.
He recognized the spike.
Yes, he was a thorn, like a hedgehog.
The most recent victim of his thorns had been an early relationship that had nevertheless been promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have eased his lonely boredom, and it might have brought some substance to his life.
Ailin Solomons had un tamed hair and was a delicately delicate beauty with a cheerful heart, from a village in the north, even more rugged and farther away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling companion, who Kevern assumed was his aunt. An aunt had inherited a house in a damp but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was fittingly Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, snails had left their mark on the windows, keeping the whole place their own, weeds grew in the garden, like giant cabbage heads.
The cabin was like a children's fairy tale, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Written by Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is nominated for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
The nominations will be published next week.
Kevern had sat hand in hand with Ailinn on a broken terrace chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening with a disunity to the reception, through which the whole country heard soothing music and soothing news, when the crossed, sunburned feet of Ailini reminded Kevern of a song that had been sung by a black performer who had long been forgotten and often heard by his father in the cabin’s shrouds beneath.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were, in principle, too aggressive and no longer played on the receiver.
They were not banned — nothing was actually banned — they were just no longer played.
They wanted to leave them in oblivion, like the word unhola itself.
Public opinion did not achieve what laws and declarations had not achieved: just as in literature people chose the memoirs of heroes, cookbooks and romances, in music they favored the ballads.
During the day, Kevern began to press the imaginary piano and sing a serenade to the large feet of Ailini with an arrogant comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a famous song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and at the same time raised two fingers naturally in front of his mouth.
This is what his father had always done before the "j" got away from his lips.
It had started as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me he played the same game with his own father.
If you let go of the word "j" and didn't remember to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn had never heard such a thing.
Jazz wasn't actually banned, it wasn't just played.
The improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only room for one "if" word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same thing had happened to cleverness.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was the wit of music.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, he had become familiar with jazz music through his father’s semi-secret CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailinn, it was likely that he did not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Here again, there was no need for laws or coercion.
Obedient society meant that each of its parts accepted with gratitude — gratefully, as if they had been saved by happiness — the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people of African-Caribbean genealogy are best suited to entertain and exercise, so they sang and ran.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were naturally gifted with electrical equipment, so it was their job to make sure that each family had a functional telephone that was used to handle matters.
Those remaining in the Polish community worked as plumbers; the last Greeks broke plates.
When what happened, if it came to pass, those from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled quickly in fear of being accused of burning the flames and fearing that the flames would catch them next, opened restaurants serving Labneh yogurt and burning a water pipe, and continued their lives with eyes set on the ground and boredom.
Let everyone do what they have to do.
Ailinn had only heard the ballads, and it was difficult for him to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung had ever been dressed as music.
Love was expressed through music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe the Bigfoots think so.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of security.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to lift two fingers to his lips with Ailinn.
Ailinn thought he was weird already.
"It was funny to my dad," he said instead.
Ailin shook his head in disbelief, and his hair covered the field of sight of Kevern.
There's nothing to see in the whole world except Ailin's huge crow's black hair pad.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
Ailinn seemed genuinely confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't exactly big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I find you attractive because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix it.
I'm twisted in that way.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
In spite of his gentle eyes.
Ailin Solomons blushed and got out of his terrace chair and at the same time knocked down the receiver and spilled the wine they had just had.
Even the wine was made of selyan flowers, so he could not use it as a reason for colliding.
In his nervousness, he seemed to shake, like palm leaves in a storm.
"And your fat head is what I'm pervertedly attracted to you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern felt sorry for Ailinn, both for his own unwarranted cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailinn decided to stand against him.
Did Ailinn think he was gonna hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in the cold northern archipelago where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically like life here.
The same vast, cold sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, even more paleer and diabolical after what happened than their smugglers and breaker grandparents, walked from pub to pub, ready to beat any woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Thick head?
If he wasn't careful, he'd see a fat fist!
Suck first — kissing had become the most common word for erotic encounter between man and woman; the antidote for the meaningless love ballads pumping out the receiver — first suck and then attack.
Kevern thought it was too much, too, for the sucking itself was hostile.
Ailin Solomons' body language told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of the terrace chair like an old man.
Ailinn also felt weary, but the depth of Kevern’s grief surprised him.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
Ailinn followed him — just as his traveling companion watched Kevern go out the window upstairs — to a man who was responsible for his own heavy life.
Adam leaving the garden, he wondered.
He felt pity for Kevern and the men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him to strike.
The man who turned his back, bowed down, ashamed, beaten, who had lost all will to fight — why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had seen it once before this moment?
When Ailin Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the General Opinion-measured Private Institute in Ofnow, conducted a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-hard violence in those areas of the country where the reduction or even the end of violence was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to eradicate it.
"Many things have already been accomplished, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "in order to compensate for the natural aggression of the people who have fought for thousands of years and most often won, especially in the abandoned and remote corners where, despite the towers of the church across the hedges, human mildness has rarely been known over time.
However, some things should not be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower the appetites it produces.
The people weep among the sentimental ballads, devour tales of overcome adversities and swear in the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old-fashioned cruelty persists in the grip of both rural communities and urban cohabiting areas, and there is also evidence of a new, more vicious fight in homes, workplaces, our streets and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to dramatise," his director commented after reading the full report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum put her eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme still appealed to her right not to answer personal questions.
Feminist?
Once again, silence.
"I'm not asking," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I'm opposed to atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
In this workplace, prejudice is not maintained.
We are servants of an open-minded society.
Although a certain type of hypersensitivity in itself is totally acceptable and respectful, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, things that you have just presented to me.
Clearly, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil soul, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
SAID WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened yesterday, if it ever happened, will destroy the fundamental vitality of the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, the flashon-pink LED light proclaimed a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for a quarter or longer of the previous century.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence and the sung word is better than written, but nothing prevails over love.
"I understand what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered in a quiet voice when she was sure that her director had quit, "and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves to be.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to SIIHEN in the first place, what happened if it happened.
True, this time we do not pour out our hatred and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz used his fingers to form a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "when you describe as 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their 'hate and distrust on others'."
A person like you should not have to remind you that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no 'we' or 'other'.
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest, in that chaos," Esme ventured to continue, "no group of society can say that they have behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What was done was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it – we agree on this.
And just as it is unnecessary to make accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to make them.
But what's the past for if you don't learn from it --
The past exists so we can forget about it.
If I may add one more thing --
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'll go over your report," he said and indicated that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, he was hit by a motorcyclist on the sidewalk, whose driving was described by passersby as "evil and fierce".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho's army forbids the attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the Lesotho army have denied having staged an attack on the government and said that they were working against a police officer who was suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The head of state and his family travelled to a neighbouring South Africa after telling them that he was threatened with death.
The military representative, Major Ntlele Ntoi, denied the attack and said that the army thus responded to the threat of 'political fanatics'. The police have been said to have tried to arm fanatics.
"Lesotho's defence forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics when they are ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America News Office.
According to Clayson Monyela, President of the South African Government, military action seemed to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces seem to be in all respects consistent with the characteristics of the revolutionary company," he says.
According to Lesotho’s army officials, the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday, and the capital was in a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that he is the target of the action because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions due to disagreements between the government of the Great Coalition.
He thus denies contempt for government power, even though it is claimed otherwise.
Shopping magazine: Microsoft will set up a data centre in Uusimaa
Microsoft has set up a large data centre in a location in Uusimaa, the location of which the company refuses to specify.
In a notice sent by Microsoft to the media, the company states that it does not indicate the location of all its data centres for security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It's an investment for Microsoft for hundreds of millions of dollars.
In public, Oulu or Kajaani had previously been placed in the centre’s seat.
Microsoft completely closes its Oulu office, which takes the job from about 500 people.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will terminate up to 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Microsoft Communications Director, says to STT that the company does not comment on the number of employees employed by the new data centre.
On Monday, Kauppalehti reported on the establishment of a data centre in Uusimaa.
He's accused of assaulting a girl on a traffic light crossing.
A 78-year-old man is accused of assaulting a three-year-old girl at a traffic light crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of hitting a girl at a crossroads in Pittenween, Eastern Neuk.
According to prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car recklessly and injured her.
Stewart, 78 from Anstruther, denied the charges at the Dundee Sheriff's hearing.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have several different device options to choose from.
The preferred option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures at a family party using several different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules you should follow.
Always double-check your device.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed waterproofly.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a setting to optimize underwater imaging conditions.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure you know how deep your device can be.
Some cameras can only withstand a depth of 5 feet, while others can withstand a depth of 50-60 feet.
Take a look at both ordinary and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital cameras reviews.
Take several pictures — many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to compose the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see underwater, and the composition of the picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
If your camera also allows forks, which means taking several photos at once with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
Light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you can see.
Try to get close to the target you're shooting.
This is important advice when shooting on land, but even more important under water because light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when an action camera is in use: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, which means that the photographer must be close to the target in order to fill the whole picture up to the frames.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders — protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not elect candidates despite the growing unrest that called for democratic reform in the 2017 elections.
The decision is likely to give a spark to long-awaited protests on the Hong Kong Business Quarter after activists start planning and implementing demonstrations only hours after the decision has been published.
The decision of the People's Congress in China to give the Communists the power to eradicate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was to be expected, but it is still infuriating," says Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
This isn't what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kong people.
It is clear that we are dealing with an autocratic regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Congress Committee of China, defended the Chinese regime by saying that it would be too 'coatic' to stand as a general candidate for the election of the Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when Great Britain handed Hong Kong over to China, Beijing promised the residents of the region that they would be able to choose their own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to the Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to exercise strict control over the electoral process through the appointment committee, which is managed from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the decision, some of the biggest and most prominent protests in the region took place in Hong Kong for years.
The campaign for democracy was largely backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, the organisers of which have threatened to block the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal voting rights.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in front of Hong Kong’s main government buildings.
At the demonstration, the organisers announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would generate protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details, evidently in fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online press release, the organisers said that the movement "considers the Occupy Central act as a last resort, which will only be introduced if there is no hope of dialogue and no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last opportunity for dialogue has been lost and the taking over of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday the security measures were tight near the main government buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, unrest is fueled by the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing control of their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has led to competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is a fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are disappearing under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s lifeblood — the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to great financial losses, depending on how many people take part in it and how long it lasts", says Regina Ip, the legislator, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to see Hong Kong slipping out of our grip.
Such an image would be bad for investing.
In the media of the Chinese state, there have also been stories that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the minions of the revolutionary Western powers".
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights involving 780 000 people — more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations for democracy in the region.
United States prom tradition strikes British universities: new students private jets
We are excited to respond to the demand by setting up Britain's first class of luxury travel for today's students.
In addition to a private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 to ensure the most memorable possible arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security aspect of the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in vehicles loaded to the limit.
When this is combined with many VIP features (VIP friends), we are ready to offer students today as easy and high-quality transportation as possible to the university.
According to the company's representative, reservations have not yet been received because the service has only just been established, but added that "students will start making orders in the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, even though most students pay £9,000 per academic fee.
Today’s students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the National Student Association criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, vice-president of the university section of the organization, "this service plan seems to be a long way from the life of the majority of students".
Many of their studies this month begin to be shocked by the level of living costs when the financial aid available in the form of loans and grants is lagging behind the huge increase in basic living costs.
For sale in Ipswich Pig House
Real estate agents removed the picture of a house for sale in Suffolk after discovering that a big pig is lying in the living room in the picture.
A one-bedroom house with a price of 120 000 pounds is located on a private road in Ipswich.
The ad included a picture of the living room where the pig leaned his head on the couch.

"However, the photo ended up in the notification by accident and has since been deleted," says the company's representative.
In the announcement, Connells describes the former meeting house as a "one-bedroom house of unique quality".
Even though the real estate office has removed the image from its website, it is still displayed in advertisements.
The sale of the house has attracted interest in social media, where the question is whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Basketball: Fans’ encouragement almost too much: Sasu Salin had to faint in the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was the embodiment of Finnish victory today.
He was able to forget his sinister U.S. fight and turned the blood of the second half of Ukraine into seismic solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the wolf fans and did it in style:
I almost fainted there at the end of the field, that encouragement was so great.
It just got darker, couldn't help it.
That noise and the white ocean was almost too much for me.
Salin’s power moments contained nine surfaces in a fast pace, snags, discs, and tangles in every place.
I don't know how it happened, but I got into the flow mode that it all worked out.
They just come from somewhere sometimes, now to a place that's incredibly important, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
Do all that stuff.
Now it was great to see that everyone else caught up with the plot.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is the team’s joy pill and spiritmaker, so it’s no wonder his example raised the whole team to flight, which was too much for the big and rough Ukrainian five.
Finland in the World Cup after a 32-year break: The previous ones remembered a gross judge game
Heikki Montonen (right) was Finland's main coach at the Argentine World Cup in 1982.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men’s volleyball team last played in the World Cup finals.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was the second coach in Finland and the current player-agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament than yesterday: it was a fire-hot match against France in the beginning.
"In the game's resolution balls, the judge game was glaring," Kosonen recalled.
We had already won, and both teams had already set behind.
Suddenly, the game was continued.
We lost it 2-3, and then the shit went crazy more," Parkkali said.
Finland played under the command of head coach Heikki Montonen and finally ranked 17th.
Now Finland is back among the world's champions, when the Polish World Cup will be on its way today on Saturday.
Many things have changed dramatically in international volleyball over the past 32 years.
The players' strength values are about the same as before, but there is now more quality and skill.
The average lengths of players have also increased.
The game is faster than before," thought Parkkali.
But what will happen in Poland?
Finland’s player material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to be able to move forward from the beginning.
Then it can be tough," Kosonen says.
Seppo Sirkka
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a victory match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
Let's hope this is the 17th floor.
South Korea and Tunisia should go down," Parkkali said.
The legend Reino Kosonen was second coach of the national team in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö aired in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and evening devotion at Buenos Aires Seamen Church were part of the national team’s program at the World Cup in 1982.

Finnish tourists rescued Cita dog from Mount Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
On Thursday, when Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini bravely offered to help.
On the weekend Mikkelsen looked for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank his helpers once more.
Mikkelsen told me in a public Facebook update that the Cita dog that was with him on Thursday in the mountains hurt his paws.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in steep terrain.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
Many times I tried to lure it and pull it forward a bit, but its feet did not just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, there was no help from the police, a nearby hotel, or passers-by.
By nightfall, things were beginning to look threatening.
Fortunately, there were two hikers who were ready to help: Antti Soini of Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their campsite when they saw a woman and a dog on the mountainside.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm compared to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog," says Antti Soini in his message to the Evening Sanomat.
Soon a German man came along with a camping mattress.
From the mattress to Cita, they got a stretcher like the one where the wounded dog was attached.
A German man showed up after us when we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog down the slope for a while, Soini says.
PHOTO: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down with a mattress.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but it was slow to carry in difficult terrain.
About an hour and a half later, however, Cita was happily brought down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still on Facebook looking for "international heroes" so he could thank them once more.
The Soins answered him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unreachable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen will be happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all the praise and honor, I will be forever grateful to them.
On the night against Monday, the Soini were already on their way home.
They'd gotten some happy things from Mikkelsen: they said Cita's feeling better!

Genetic anomaly is often misdiagnosed
For years a British woman feared death because of a misdiagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth had only a few years left to live because she had a diagnosed second disease.
He actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT). It means a number of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as there is so little knowledge of them.
It is estimated that some 23 000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motors, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking and toe splintiness.
The disease can also cause numbness or pain and is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he had Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and die before reaching the age of 30.
Today, a 51-year-old mother of two says that as a child I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer than anyone else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently from the others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he had several cuts in the Achilles tendon to straighten his legs. In connection with the surgery, after the doctor left the room, he quickly glanced at his examination papers, which said he was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I checked the medical records in the library and wrote to the FA society," he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicking.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose my entire ability to function.
I went through this on my own and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he found that his walking had not deteriorated as much as he had thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just hugged me and said, "Baby girl, I don't think you have this condition because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT.
"When I was explained what CMT was, I thought I had been delayed," he says.
Charity CMT UK organises CMT month to pay attention to the disease.
A Hundred Migrants Found In a Coal Car in Macedonia
The Macedonian authorities have found more than a hundred illegal immigrants on a coal-carrying train, the country’s Ministry of the Interior reported on Monday.
The stowaways were mostly Syrian and Iraqi refugees.
The train was coming from Greece.
The colonists were found late Sunday in Veles, Central Macedonia.
It was hard to communicate with most of them.
They did not know where they were, where they came from and where they were going," said Ivo Koteski, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the police, migrants had paid about EUR 3 000 each to enter Greece, and an additional EUR 800 to 900 to enter Serbia.
Illegal immigrants pass through Macedonia with a large number of two million inhabitants on their way to Western Europe.
Three million people have already fled the bloody civil war in Syria.

Nastola donated 1.4 hectares of beach property to Bottas - about 60000 euros
The municipal board of Nastola donated a 1.4-hectare beach plot to the shape driver Valtteri Bottas from Villä on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
The municipal government showed a fair sense of sports and was unanimous in its decision.
There were no gravel sounds at the meeting when the plot was decided, says Mayor Pauli Syirakki.
Bottas's gift plot has farm buildings - a total of seven.
The municipality will dismantle them this year, except for one.
Bottas has promised to build a free-time residence on the property within two years.
We are pleased that he has enjoyed his birthright and wants to continue to be here.
Valtteri has visited primary schools every year to tell about his sports career and life.
And hopefully he will continue to do so," says the mayor.
The municipality manager estimates the value of the beach property at EUR 40000 to 60000.
The beach is shallow and child-friendly.
The area has been owned by the municipality for over ten years.
Throughout the decades, Nastola has kept sports successful with gift plots in the municipality.
Aki Parviainen, World Champion of Spear Throwing, and Tuuli Matinsalo, World Champion of Aerobick, got the detached plots from the municipality and built the hilarious detached houses.
But instead of staying in Nastola, they sold their properties and moved away.
Parviainen and Matisinlon came to Nastola for work and then changed life as things changed.
Bottas is a native of Nastola, and his situation is different, Syracuse inches and believes that Bottas will remain in his municipality of residence.
Hull hired the attacker with a record amount of Hernandez Society.
The Champion League Society Hull invested a record sum in the acquisition of Abel Hernandez, a member of the Uruguayn National Team.
Hernandez will trade the Italian club Palermo to Hull for £9.5 million, or approximately €12 million.
It's a three-year contract.
Hernandez scored 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and took the lead in Italy.
He's scored seven goals in 14 matches on the Uruguayn national team.
At last summer's World Cup final tournament, Hernandez came in two games from the exchange to the airport.
Abel is a fantastic acquisition and shows how far we have come in a short time," said Hull’s head coach Steve Bruce.
On Monday, Hull also told us that he had acquired Senegalese national team captain Mohamed Diamen from West Ham.
The Russian space experiment failed - the geckos sent on a sex trip died
The five little geckos sent by Russia into space have died, says Roscosmos, the Russian Federation Space Agency.
The Gekos traveled on board the Foton-M4 satellite for over a month and a half.
Satellite returned to the country on Monday morning in Finnish time.
The purpose of the test was to study the reproductive capacity and use of geckos in a weightless condition.
One male gecko and four females participated in the test.
Although the experiment sounds bizarre, its purpose was serious.
Little is known about the effects of weightlessness on the development of gecko eggs, for example.
The effects on the Gekko can be used to predict the effects of non-weighting on man while he is in a state similar to that of longer periods of time, illustrating New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause or cause of death of the geckos will be determined.
According to the Interfax news agency, the passengers who were crucified as "sex geckos" were frozen.
It is also surprising that the fruit flies that traveled on the same Foton-M4 were able to survive the trip and also had offspring.
France arrested a terrorist suspect at Nice Airport
France arrested a man suspected of terrorism at Nice airport on Saturday.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of being a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities informed on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track him down after he had used money to lure a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.
The girl was to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border.
The airline did not believe the girl’s explanation that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but alerted the authorities.
The authorities contacted the girl’s father, who was completely unaware of her daughter’s intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, the man is from Chechnya, but he now lives in France.
The French intelligence authorities had followed his actions before.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalising young people who have attracted Iraq or Syria to the wars are also a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or people registered in France have travelled, returned to Syria or are currently planning to go to Syria during the last conflict.
Koponen: We have a good chance of winning
The hopes of the basketball team for the post are at stake when Finland meets Ukraine today in its second match for the World Cup.
If the opening loss to the United States was expected, Ukraine will again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for the extension.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petteri Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine won its first match in the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team is coached by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under the command of Ukraine playing aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-metre world champion from three years ago.
He threw 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but we've been playing them before, and we need to get our standard defenses in order," Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland would play better than in yesterday's defeat to the United States.
We need to find our own strength again.
I can assure you there will be a normal pack of wolves on the field," Möttölä said.
The alleged naked pictures of Hollywood stars are spreading online - some of them authenticated.
There are a number of naked pictures on the Internet that are claimed to represent well-known public figures.
Among other things, the actor Jennifer Lawrence has been victimized by a 'naked image campaign'.
The entertainment site TMZ has published an angry comment from Lawrence’s representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a flagrant violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (on the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures will be prosecuted, the representatives are threatening.
According to TMZ, the actor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, has confirmed that the images that spread about her are genuine.
He had taken those pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a gruesome effort it was to do this.
I have sympathy for everyone who was the victim of a hack, he writes on the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice calls images of her own name counterfeit.
There are also real or fake nude photos of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka goalie criticizes his own: "They don't work hard enough to get out of here"
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the betting league.
The comments made by goaltender Walter Viitala after Sunday’s VPS match well reflect the confused current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
But you have to adapt to everything," Viitala said after the battle that ended in the loss of 1-2.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes, especially during the first half of the game.
The goalie Viitala wasn't so happy to play defense.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and that is why defenders in front of Viitala have also changed rapidly.
With the player roulette, many young players have also had opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get out of here sometimes," Viitala snorted without naming any individual player.
Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi agreed to some extent with Viitala.
“After the game, I told certain players that if you come to practice and games to have fun and you think you’re a betting league player and you don’t have to work, you’re probably on the wrong team,” Kuqi said.
I've given a lot of kids time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
However, Mr Kuqi also pointed out that players cannot be expected to succeed immediately when their players are constantly changing.
This period has not had the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the defense head, there's been a change of people.
That is the main reason we are in this position," Kuqi said.
After the VPS loss, Honka is a serialjumbo, at the equities with the second last TPS.
There are seven more rounds of the league, so the Espoans still have time to avoid falling to number one.
I've never dropped a team, and I'm not gonna drop it now.
We're definitely not going to fall out of this show," goaltender Viitala said.
Lars von Trier making a TV show after decades of break
The film director, Lars von Trier, is going to go back to making TV shows.
The Danish director is preparing a TV show called The House That Jack Building.
The series project was told by Louise Vesth, the producer of Trier's films, at the Venice Film Festival on Monday.

"Hold your breath," says Aalbæk Jensen in the press release.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been known in recent years for his media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom Series to television.

Isabelle Roberts roared so loud when ice - cold water was poured on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I just roared, but as I roared, I felt my jaw getting stiff," he says to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing and began to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old British who took part in a super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to the hospital, where the jaw was put back in place.
Video has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
View to how wolves howl (also): How can you explain the increase in the number of fans?
I had a great feeling today.
That is what basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995 when Finland had played against France in the European Championship in the Marouss ballpark in Athens.
He didn't exaggerate.
I remember the game when he was there.
So were the about 100 Finns who shouted the noise of 20,000 spectators, otherwise an empty hangar.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the Finland-Ukraine World Cup match.
There are 80 times as many Finnish fans in Bilbao.
The European Championships 1995 was a time for looking for Finnish basketball.
Men made their way to the finals by winning, among other things, a Russian qualifying match at Helsinki Sports Centre.
That victory opened the doors to the cream of Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising kids like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann took Möttölä to the final tournament team with lime lines.
A solution on which many disagreed.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was wise from afar, even though not everything went according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep.
In the Athens Games there were reportedly just over a hundred Finns present.
The group included journalists, gamers’ relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
There are journalists, relatives and coaches in Bilbao, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
I'm sure no one can say the exact number of Finnish racers.
Estimates have moved between 7 500 and 10 000.
No matter what the number is, it's an incomprehensible amount.
This is explaining to sports sociologists.
In a global global world economy, companies move across borders.
There is still an opportunity in sport to look at how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we can go to see how our girls and our sons are doing well in the world," says Professor Hannu Itkonen of Sports Sociology.
Surely both in Spain and in the volleyball World Cup in Poland there are Finns who are looking for an experience.
It's a shared experience.
It still doesn't explain everything.
You have to be attracted to sport itself.
Crying makes sport a part of popular culture.
There is a lower threshold for going to sports games than Berlin to see art.
Without success, the masses will still not be able to move.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball league and players to engage in top-notch sports professionally.
Almost ten years went by.
Then the direction changed and the national team action was lifted to the pedestal.
The volleyball people made the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruits of the work.
As Itkonen says, both species have managed to produce their top-of-the-line sport, where the Holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
Then the audience will also be interested.
And the media have taught us what this kind of carnivalism is, Itkonen reminds me.
Can ball sports also transfer this massive interest to the home series?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
Crying thinks the question is good and does not necessarily give an answer that would be very good for the species.
Another school believes that interest is shifting.
One is the one who doesn't want a sweet belly full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, domestic series are not of interest to you twice.
It's a challenge for the escorts in the middle of the rush.
Confirming the Bottas property - nearly 1.5 hectares from the lake
Nastola rewards the shape driver Valtteri Bottas on the beach property.
The municipal government unanimously approved the transfer of 1.4 hectares at its meeting on Monday.
In the future, the property will have a free-time residence.
In Nastola, the success of Bottas has been monitored since his kartting days.
He is considered a good ambassador to market Lahti, the Lahti region and Nastola.
The gift plot is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärvi.
It has come under the ownership of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate transaction.
The area has seven buildings in order to be demolished, of which six will be demolished at the expense of the municipality by the end of this year.
Bottas won the formala 1 in the Belgian race as his fourth prize winner this year.
He's fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a native of Nastola and has lived in Villälä, his childhood.
He currently lives in England, but he goes to Nastola every time he's free of formulas.
Bottas has visited secondary schools and youth facilities.
Design smart clothes are coming, but I don't think they're for the poor.
It will present and test them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren's smart shirts are tested by the ball players in the field, but also by the top-of-the-art amateur Marcus Giron.
According to him, the shirt helps him to monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors have been woven into the nylon shirt, from which information is transmitted to the mop on the shirt and from there to the smartphone or tablet.
Sensors measure heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress, and steps.
Before throwing the shirt into the washing machine, the moped acting as a central unit will be removed.
The fashion house has not given us the exact time to start selling the shirt, nor has it even hinted at the price, the Tech Times reported.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests in smart clothes.
Athos, California, has brought in a smart shirt and smart shorts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The clothes cost $100 apiece, and the thumb-sized central unit that they require is $2,100.
Red Orbit also wrote about the technocrats.
A Smart Way to Save in Textbooks
The cost of university books in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder, starting his second year of study, found a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which students of later years borrow their books for nominal remuneration instead of selling them straight away.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I paid $10 for using it for the whole semester and a big sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester's books would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the university's board of directors, the average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have many ways of reducing these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder’s idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay significantly less for it than students who buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which runs over 250 campus bookstores, the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Statistics on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of university bookstores in the past spring were book books," says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus bookstores.
Here is the simplest way to save money.
Online stores
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would cost at the campus bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's book "Calculus" is almost $290, but the book is available at Chegg.com for $239.99 from the online specialist bookstore.
Buy Used
Books used are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by other notes and worn appearance.
For example, the "Calculus" book can be used at the Chegg.com online store for $93.49.
Brigham Young University’s senior year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says that he bought a book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” at Amazon.com for only $0.42.
If it was a new book, it would have cost 48 bucks.
Ingrid Bracey, director of Amherst's College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous editions can be used in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid for a new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Renting
Renting textbooks should be considered if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them after completing the course.
By renting, you can save more than 80 per cent of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a book called "Calculus" for the entire semester costs about $20.
Find out about the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the charges resulting from the use and wear of the highlight pen.
Renter, watch out: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the book purchase price.
E-books
It may also be a question of obtaining e-books instead of ordinary paper.
These books are sometimes rented out to the holder of the e-book, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
You can get an e-book of "Calculus" at the Chegg store for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many students in literature save the most because many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It pays to compare different sellers, whatever option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start in Pepperdine law school, recommends using the book ISBN number to determine the price, because it can be used to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before ordering online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learned this the hard way.
The book he bought was on ice for four weeks, and he finally had to obtain it at the full price of the university bookstore.

Nearly double the number of people killed in fires compared to last year
This year, almost twice as many people have died in fires of fire compared to last year.
According to media surveillance by the Finnish Rescue Association (Spek), 55 people have already died in the fires in 49 different fires.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11.
According to the Association’s statistics on fire deaths, the last worse situation was in 2009, when 64 people had died in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in blocks of flats, 21 in detached houses and seven in terraced houses and other small houses.
Spec reminds me of reviewing home fire safety.
At least all home smoke detectors should be verified according to Speck.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial fire-extinguishing equipment is easily accessible.
There must also be an accessible way out of all the premises of the home.
Children should also be informed of the electrical equipment they are allowed to use while alone at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Opponents of the NATO Summit protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport for a march against NATO.
On Sunday, about 150 people met at Cardiff City Hall for a so-called counter- summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events this weekend and spoke with the demonstrators who had arrived from Belgium.
Young people were rescued by air from the blue mountains of Australia
TWO teenage hikers were raised to safety after being stuck overnight in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man wandered off after noon on Sunday to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The family were worried about young people who had not returned home and called the police at eight o’clock in the evening.
A search party of local police and helpers was sent out to search for young people, and the two were found about 11:00 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and struck his head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were brought to safety on Monday morning.
The hikers were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdrew from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
According to the Ukrainian army, the soldiers were ordered to retreat.
According to Ukraine, the paratroopers have been fiercely converging with Russian tanks in the field.
According to an army spokesman, the gunfire on the other side has been so precise that Russian professional soldiers are likely to be the shooter.
In the past 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
In the Asovan Sea, a Ukrainian patrol ship that had won a artillery hit off South-East Ukraine yesterday sank in the morning, reports the Border Guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The Border Guard didn't know where the ship was shot.
Separatists already told me yesterday in the social media that they shot the ship.
According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov insisted that the Ukrainian forces should immediately withdraw to positions from which they could not fire on civilians.
According to the Foreign Minister, the Minsk talks today between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE should create an immediate cease-fire without conditions.
Mr Lavrov also pointed out that Russia would respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First of all, we will protect our own interests, our own economy, our social sector, our businesses.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rains caused floods in Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen when heavy rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters cut off several roads, disrupted traffic and buried cars under them.
On Sunday the authorities estimated that it might take some time to stop the flood, even though the rains were predicted to end by Monday.
The heavy rains caught the Swedish authorities by surprise and no weather warning was given in advance.
Ari Mustala, the on-call meteorologist at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimated that the rain front was very local.
The rainy area looks narrow and stationary.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
French socialists should "keep quiet and help France", Francois Hollande's main sponsor says
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to 'show their feelings' to the Socialist President, who was in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not win the approval of the majority of the French people.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"It is our job to stand by him," said Valls and deserved a round of applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to abandon the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the proposal put forward earlier this week by the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, that the rule should be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, caused dissension by appearing at the meeting of the socialist parliamentarians who expressed differing opinions and criticising the Socialist Party for allowing 'France to give up hope for the future'.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme right-wing national front, mocked the ongoing disunity between the socialists and said that he did not believe that the new government of Valls would last for a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war on a phone call, but so has Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
"And the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He repeated his party’s proposal to break up the parliament, and he believed that his party’s election victory in early elections was certain, and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The ruling party in France suffered a crushing defeat in the March municipal elections and the extreme right held the tip of the list in the May EU elections.
According to an opinion poll in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party may break up into several competing groups before the end of the Hollande season in 2017.
The political scientist at Po University, Pascal Perrineau, warned that the French will soon lose their patience if the new socialist government does not succeed in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, things could get worse.
Pokka cheated on the good morning of the Finnish host Kirsi Alm-Uoran, Nina Rahkola and Meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka seriously betrayed the program in the recorded part.
The Morning Finland program released a funny video of the recordings made on Thursday on its Facebook page last Thursday.
In the video, hosts Kirsi Alm-Uoja and Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pou are trying to record Good morning to Finland’s ad-puffi on the next day, but the recording is not quite going to go straight.
Alm-Mora is going crazy in her words when she tries to pronounce the word "budgetary" and her confusion also causes Pouda and Rahkola to lose their cheeks over and over again.
And these heroes should be allowed to broadcast live again tomorrow," says Good Morning in Finland's Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has both been liked and distributed on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo office, ranked third in the pottery series in 1972.
This is Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel.
On Fredrikinkatu in Helsinki, a Socialist International meeting was held at the Building Masters' House in May 1971.
There were a lot of heads of state at the meeting, and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had more than five minutes to shoot.
I took this picture four to five meters away.
The light and the background were right.
At once I realized that this time I succeeded.
You can see from the look on Meir's face that the Middle East leaders have had a difficult time in the past.
At that time, you were able to do well with pictures of known people or events.
It’s great that you can also succeed with other pictures now, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the fall of Lasse Virén from the Munich Olympics.
That's not what I sent to the competition.
Dissertation: Aarnio investigation cost more than EUR 5 million
The investigation into the legality of the activities of the Helsinki Police Department of Drugs has already cost more than EUR 5 million and required 30-50 person-years.
This is how Jyri Rajamäki assessed his doctoral thesis on information technology at the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the enforcement of police law and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining IT systems for investigations and judicial proceedings.
According to Rajamäki, modern technology enables multiple use of forensic material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which information collected to investigate a crime is automatically electronic evidence that meets the chain of evidence and at the same time allows for comprehensive judicial control.
The doctoral dissertation will be examined on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetarian food was forgotten on the school wall: "Caucas diet includes fish and chicken dishes"
A picture of the special press release on the wall of the Pirkkala Women's Travel School caused food to rise on social media, says Yle on her website.
Vegetarians!
Fish and chicken food belonging to the vegetarian diet at school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we prepare a vegetable option!
This is stated in a 15 - year - old newsletter on the school wall.
You can see the picture from here.
The image spread in social media has caused people to send indignant feedback to the Pirkkala municipality.
Arja Vaarma, Chief of Food and Cleaning Services, says to Yle that the note that was left on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Apparently, before I came, there has been an idea of this kind that has been discussed with health care in due course.
Every student gets a meal as he wishes," he says to Yle.
Today, in Pirkkala schools, students are offered a vegetarian choice only with parental permission and a doctor’s or nurse’s certificate of vegetarian diet.
The problem justifies the solution to Yle by the fact that young people’s vegetal experiments may leave their nutrition in a short position and the lack of meat or chicken can cause wonder to their parents.
Norwegian Cruise near the $3 billion Prestige Cruise contract
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is conducting negotiations to purchase its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for three billion dollars.
As a result of the transaction, Norwegian Cruise, with a market value of 6,8 billion dollars, would have access to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of Prestige Cruises as it continued to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that the negotiations will not be successful.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 % of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public because negotiations were not held in public.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments and Apollo’s representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise from Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013 when it amounted to USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami as well, sails under Oceania and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the year before.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise of emerging economies in the coming years, such as the Chinese and Indian middle classes.
Companies are competing to become the number one choice for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
In January 2014, Prestige Cruises registered its first issuance of shares on the US stock market.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares since the 2007 deal, which amounted to $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 in its current composition after its merger with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and casino company of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
According to the published data, Genting accounted for 28 per cent of the company, Apollo 20 per cent and TPG Capital LP 8 per cent of the company from the end of June onwards.
The combined share of North American cruise capacity of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises is 82 %, as shown in the registration document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the issuance of shares.
The City Board of Tampere will discuss this today.
Animalia hopes that the City Government will support the initiative robustly.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, the University of Tampere's doctoral dissertation, it is appropriate to close quickly during the period of the dolphinariums in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, the view has become more widespread that the presence of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither animal-friendly nor ethically sustainable.
This view should also be taken to Tampere.
The abolition of the dolphinarium is not only an issue of animal rights, but also the issue of Tampere's image as a tourist destination," Tuomivaara points out.
According to Judiciary, the death of Näsi-delfiin strengthens the demands for the resolution of the dolphinarium activity.
The death of Näs is a sad follow-up to the dark history of the Dolphinarium in Särkänniemi.
It is time to put a stop to the deaths, close the dolphin prison, and find out how the dolphins in Tampere could be transferred to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, Tuomivaara insists.
Your nose did not have time to return to the dolphins' original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkänniemi will have more to live than a non-inspiring concrete pool, Tuomivaara hopes.
The Animal Protection Association Animalia aims to ban the use of all wild animal species in circuses in the overall reform of the Animal Protection Act under preparation.
This includes the dolphins.
In support of this demand, Animalia’s Executive Director, Tuomivaara, will participate in today’s 1.9th demonstration on behalf of dolphins.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will take a stand against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting season, some 2,300 dolphins are cruelly captured or killed each year, either for the use of dolphins or for food.
Mr Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with East Ukraine on a new state.
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the 'statehood' of the dissociating region, Russia's news sources report.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled Eastern Ukraine region would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand for negotiations with Russian rebels as equal partners to the government of Kiev is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the beginning of the violence five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the region and thus force the Ukrainian Government to effectively grant the newly declared Novorossian independence which will enable it to go to Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with State Channel 1, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to take back the region of Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk, which was dominated by separatists in March and April, following the annexation of Moscow to the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently baptized the region as the 'Novorossija', the 'New Russia' – this term resembles the days of glory that preceded the revolutions of the Russian Great Power.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tassi, Putin said that the planned peace talks would be an illusion as long as Ukrainian politicians were campaigning for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces were attacking civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"We must start a wide-ranging negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the State of South-East Ukraine, taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to 'stateism' is linked to a broader sense of independence, which has been discussed for months with the leadership of Kiev in its attempt to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are being threatened.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine'.
The interim remark by the Kremlin representative, which was intended to correct the 'false interpretation' of Putin's comments, underlined that the Russian regime is dealing with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions differently from the one in Crimea, where it practically took over an area where the majority of the population of 2 million people is ethnically Russian.
It would be far more difficult for Moscow to integrate even the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically Russian and, according to pre-conflict polls, the majority of the population was in favour of remaining in Ukraine.
The independence discussed by Russian diplomats in international fora would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin practically power in an area that links Russia to the Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, which was annexed to Russia five months ago, Russia's main fleet is located as well as commercial maritime ports and historical coastal sites.
There are also mines, factories and metal smelters in the area between Rostov and Crimea, which produce vital products for the Russian army.
In his inauguration address on 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine proposed that Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making power of regions that are not members of the Ukrainian core region as regards their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ sharply from the view of the separatists perhaps armed and fomented by the Kremlin and Moscow.
Mr Putinin made his latest demand to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels made further progress last week following the invasion of Russian tanks and troops in East Ukraine from a previously peaceful area off the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the takeover of the separatist city of Novoazovski, supported by Russia, will be the beginning of a larger effort to take over the entire strategically important coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military reinforcements of Mariupol city. Mariupol, half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city between Novoazovski and the narrow land area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke to the leaders of the European Union in Brussels, asking for further action to prevent the future violations of Russia in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon reach a point from which there will be no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders suggested that additional sanctions be drawn up to enable them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine flares up again in unclear circumstances.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian Armoured Divisions and 1 000 soldiers entered the Donetsk area last week to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, a representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev on Saturday.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers surrounded by Russia in Ilovaisk was replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
Milan's opening goal was made by Japanese artist Keisuke Honda already in the seventh game minutes.
At the second half, Sulley Muntari was first hit and a little later Jeremy Menez was shot.
After his narrowing goal, Lazio got a heavyweight at the end of the game, but the goalie Diego Lopez rejected Antonio Candreva's shot.
Lopez moved to Milan for this period from Real Madrid.
In the training debut of Milan’s former attacker, the San Siro Stadium was only half-hearted.
39,000 spectators were announced for the match.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko in the vortex of the naked image scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he's horrified by the hackers who may have stolen his fiancée and the naked pictures of the Hollywood A-lister Gabi Grecko.
Since Jennifer Lawrence’s naked photos were released on the Internet as a result of a wide-ranging celebrity hacking scandal, the entertainment world has been teeming.
The hacker has been said to have a total of 60 nude photos of Star Star of Hunger Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and the actor Kirsten Dunst.
Also photos of Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Grecko in Melbourne have apparently been stolen in connection with the iCloud leak.
The list has the names of 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, said to Confidential magazine, "This is disgusting."
All personal communication and images should remain private.
