Emili Kooki led the Hurricane home victory in the opening - Savo Volley's second victory
After seven consecutive medals for the men’s volleyball Championship, Hurricane Lois started the season 2018-19 with a home win when Raisio’s Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Emili Kooki, a general player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most efficient in Hurricane by 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't happen, and then a call came in from Loimaa.
It was pretty quick to settle things," Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu, supported Kouk by 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was Samuli Kaislasalo, a national team chipper with 17 points on a match-by-match agreement.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it added extra extras to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but continuing the medal line is of course the goal," Kouki said.
Määttänen Savo Volley's most efficient
Miro Määttänen was the most powerful in Savo Volley by 18 points when the team knocked down Vantaa Ducks by Vieremä 3-0.
Our game was erratic, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately we were able to squeeze the victory.
At least I didn't have any conscious different downloads when I was playing against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3nd series in the season 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was satisfied with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was in the ceiling all the time.
I didn't feel good about opening the house.
Miro was the king. Silli played a good game, too, said Tuovinen.
The previous season of Siltala in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavesi Sammo, even when Tuovinen was the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful at 14 points.
Mikkonen again star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, winner of the 2012-13 league spot exchange, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season's opening win after he knocked down the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started just fine for itself.
Of course, today was a loss, because we were down for the fourth round from 17 to 21.
We dug somewhere for a win, and the fifth round came at the same time," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, still in the finals, the most effective of the Tigers was 28 points made by the chipper Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's picker, Mikkonen said.
Finland is the world's number one in the comparison of human capital
Finland is the world leader in the comparison of human capital, says Science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was ranked one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan ranked worst in comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, the local game ended untargeted
Real Madrid goaltender Thibaut Courtois ran into great fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian watchman Courtois managed to fight back.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico when he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, the International Football Federation, Fifa, chose him as the goalie of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale scored the best goal, but his shot was directed past the end of the opening half of the goal.
After the break, Bale was replaced by a femoral injury.
According to ESPN, disillusioned Real supporters shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the target cannon that moved to Juventus in the match.
The United States is now under attack against the right to abortion - A powerful document tells us why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected candidate Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice will be overturned by the decision by Roe against Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern’s and Annie Sundberg’s documentary Reversing Roe – the United States and abortion rights show how the current situation has come to pass over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also topical in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (sin) has been working on public relations against safe abortion and has received various levels of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of a powerful documentary, we meet gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been left to be the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri because of legal blackmail.
The clinic's armed guard says he's defending the freedom of religion in the United States.
News videos remind us of the deadly terrorist attacks on the clinics.
Let's move on to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the association of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons for the interview are good, but actually they are not even needed; a photograph of the woman who died of an abortion herself is enough.
There were deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The Republican Party in particular defended the legalisation of abortions.
In 1967, California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, Reagan, in his campaign for the presidential election in 1980, began to revolutionize religion into politics to pick up voters.
The abortion strain was also reversed by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And Donald Trump did the same thing.
The document reaches the heart of the matter in seeking the basis for the politicisation of the abortion issue.
When tax exemption was denied to religious organizations that support racial segregation, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
When writing this in the United States, the President, who has taken the votes of the religious right with an abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh as the highest candidate, who is now accused of sexual harassment by many women.
Kavanaugh can be given the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on the scale.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children on the border, with major demonstrations.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months when Israel has been firing on demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border area, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
The Ministry says that 505 people have been wounded.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike on the border zone when protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The military says they've started using force so the protesters don't break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in the demonstrations in Gaza since March when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations on the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 12 000 are injured.
The protesters called for access to the Palestinian families in the areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was founded in 1948.
An Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got the penalty kick. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's toptop Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty zone.
The referee Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left with the referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick for the 85th minute when Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed me a punitive spot, and Mario Vranc hit a 1-0 goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the championship series.
The last one was born last Saturday against the QPR with an elegant pectoral muscle.
I had another taste for Santa to work with.
After losing the ball, he went on to the end of the situation.
He created goals and defended them tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was five in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
The paedophile help service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small proportion of women experience at least some sexual interest in pre-industrial age.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Up to now, it has been difficult for those who are sexually interested in children or young people to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Foundation for Criminal Service and Sexpo train professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood and appointments were booked very quickly in Sexpo, which provides advice and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a source of shame for many.
The majority of those who perceive paedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus done nothing criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent quality.
Most hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life," says Yle, sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Chorean leaders or Congolese gynecologists?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, it may sound strange to me, but Trump is one of the biggest favourites for the prize, based on the odds of betting.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea, at least at the speech level, to commit to nuclear disarmament.
On the basis of the odds, the main favourites for Nobel Peace are President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and President Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who have met three times this year and promised to reach a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the koreas is remarkable, as it was still good last year.
Still, the reward of Kim, who has spent years on nuclear weapons and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday onwards, and Friday will be the most prominent, i.e. the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to participants in Korean diplomacy, one of the top candidates for the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape and has become the world’s leading expert in his field.
Mukwege’s work has focused attention on sexual violence, which is a gruesome by-product of many conflicts.
The UN refugee organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there will be 331 candidates for the prize.
The names of the candidates shall not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel got it.
In May, the journalist asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korea negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump’s Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which is the winner of the prize, has often given recognition to people and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multipolar world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation seen as opposed to Trump.
In the 21st century, three American politicians have been awarded the prize: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
So to reward Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in the tunnel: Motorists behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
On September 8th, the traffic chaos in the first stage of Lohja took place.
Due to the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department tried to bring the traffic back to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it could not be opened, because there are motorists in shock and they drive how it happens, the on-call fire engineer Pasi Kääriäinen told STT that he was fresh at the time.
At that time the motorway was even going in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to work against traffic rules, some others are often followed by Tapio Heiskanen, Head of Communications for Transport Security.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for an overriding reason.
Traffic safety points out that in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to start endangering traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles shall always be provided with maximum access.
In particular, it is forbidden to go in the opposite direction on the motorway, as well as to make a U-turn and cancel.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlights must always be switched on.
Stopping without compelling reason is also prohibited, as is, of course, parking.
Back in the day, there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity," says Heiskanen in the Transport Safety Bulletin.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught in the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans transported by the Inland Watership M/S Tampere would have liked to stay on the ship to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the lake floor by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship’s captain at the time.
M/S Tampere, who was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught in Vanajavesi in Akaa.
Nineteen passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one got hurt in the hash.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on board until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them to the port by fire department and by bus home," Syrjä said to STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to follow the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with the win of Ilves 4-3.
According to the side, Saturday’s hashish was due to the fact that the water level in Vanajavesi was about three feet [half m] lower than normal.
According to Syreja, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered with log trails, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant impact
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumuse Strait shortly after the shipping route was under the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syreja, there was no greater drama in the case, since the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not result in a more significant impact.
According to the margin, the navigating of the bottom has not caused any leaks or imprints on the ship and, in view, the cruises of the ship continue normally.
On Saturday morning, the diver visited to check the ship’s condition before the ship was towed off the shallows.
We are still going to the shipyard to check that no damage has been done, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S trip to Tampere, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
According to him, the cruise season will continue until the Fourth of July.
No use for ambulances
The rescue department received an alarm on the case Saturday night after a little after half past twelve.
The port of Viila was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
The on-call fire engineer Matti Willman told me late at night that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult due to darkness and a rather harsh wind.
On the night against Sunday, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced that all those on board had been evacuated and that the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s candidate for justice on trial for harassment and drunkenness may be deprived of top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who has been presented as Supreme Court Justice of the United States, may well be missing the post he is seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct during his studies.
According to Aaltola, suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in office with another person.
From time to time in the United States, there have been many conflicts between the presidential candidate for Supreme Court justice.
In this case, the candidate for a judge is usually withdrawn himself," says Aaltola.
This has enabled the president to maintain his face.
The nomination would rain down on the Democrats.
The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a very sensitive political process.
If Mr Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain on the Democratic Party in the forthcoming interim elections of the Congress, according to Aaltola.
This would increase the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment will not be held for every presidential term, for in the United States the Supreme Court judges will be appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of 70 to 80.
Republicans, too, have some doubts about the name.
The judges of the U.S. Supreme Court are normally investigated, says Aaltola.
Even though Trump has only set a week’s deadline for the FBI’s further investigation, Aaltola says that it can bring up something relevant.
Yeah, it might.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inadequacy for office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be suspicious of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to be put to the vote and the Republicans to disappear.
A woman identified a Salisbury suspect as an agent of military intelligence.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes the Russian man suspected of Salisbury poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
Based on the photographs, the woman reported that it was a military inquiry by Anatoli Tshepiga, a member of the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported that they had exposed one of the men suspected of poisoning to Tshepiga.
They said that they had already found evidence that the current identity of men is a cover.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East to a village near the border between Russia and China where Tshepiga grew up.
The woman in the village recognized the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from pictures of the British police officer who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov, a man who now calls himself himself Boshirov.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok neurotoxin in March.
The Scripts survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, the honour of a Russian hero in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspect's GRU connection.
Earlier in September, men suspected of poisoning reported to Russian television that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people as throwing bags for social welfare reform
There is now a vivid example of what the change limit for social welfare reform, as defined by the Sipilä Government, means in practice.
My municipality of birth Vaala's social services are produced by the Oulunkaare Municipal Authority, whose health service director has been elected the former Regional Director of Attendo in 2016.
The directors of the joint municipal board warn the council of a change limiter.
If social welfare expenditure now increases, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central decision-makers of the municipality were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in care for the elderly, which would end the institutional care of the ward of the health centre and a small unit of people with memory problems.
Home care would be increased, which means that the elderly living in remote villages will be torn from their roots next to the health centre to be treated as "home".
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left-wing party did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many family members, local carers and also delegates from other parties.
I presented with slides on the preparation of the Sote region how the municipality of Vaala already treats the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
There was also a neighboring councilman Carina Läntinen.
The local newspaper did a big story about the event, and it raised the Oulunkaare preparers to their hind legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any paper that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for the residents.
There are no other service providers.
The drafters only talk about the service voucher, but do not tell us what level of care they receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will provide for the elderly until the hospice.
Without a nurse?
It is because there is no doctor’s night duty that the facilities at the health centre are stopped.
Attendo will also rely on the doctors at the Vaala health centre.
An example of this is the way in which officials in the centre run delegates with inadequate information and the delegates are put back against the wall with a change limiter.
In this way the Central Party will empty the inhabitants of Vaala, for who will remain insecure to live voluntarily if there is an opportunity to move away.
Was it one of the ballots in the city center that the whole country is kept inhabited?
President Erdogan of Turkey opened the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Germany, in Cologne, thousands of people protested when the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the Rhine River since morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the signs of protestors, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10 000 people were expected to protest in advance on the streets, including the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan’s supporters were also gathered near the Great Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Mr Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and felt that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdogan and Merkel vowed to rebuild relations between the countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the attempted coup d'état in Turkey in 2016.
However, Mr Merkel stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
Review surrounded by a visit
Both the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening ceremony as the criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Mr Cansu, reported that he had come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go out on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything different from his own thinking is terrorism.
On the last German trip to Erdogan, North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three counts of murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
On Friday, the prosecutor told us that three people were charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
In February, Kuciak was found shot in his home in Bratislava with his fiancée.
He'd been investigating the connections between the politicians and the Italian mafia.
The police have suspected the murders were related to the investigation of Kuciak.
The case and the article published by Kuciak have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of cattle in sparsely populated areas on Sunday
Also due to a printing defect, the Sunday Karelian will have to be mailed without address.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where the distribution of shared boxes is carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday’s magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra magazine bouquets in the province.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Reporter Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala today live in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about her upcoming space trip, which she booked as early as 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, for which a bank loan was required.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after the unfortunate test flight that took place in 2014 and the death of the victim, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa’s flight number is 300, which means that his trip is about a year away from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours, and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells us about the future on his website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw Star Trek on TV.
They've seen the wars of the stars, and that's what left the idea of...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued its lossless course in the Champion League as it knocked down its homefield on Saturday with Brighton paints 2-0.
The season sixth winner of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by the goal sprayers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth hit of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute of Brighton's goal at the back pole.
Agüero raised his own score to five when he and Sterling sawed Brighton defense to pieces in the 65th game minutes.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 finals on the penalty spot easily.
With six wins and one draw, City has started the season leading the Champion League with 19-point catches.
However, Liverpool, who played less than one match, is only one point away.
On Saturday night, Liverpool will meet a series three Chelsea in his seventh round match.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term 2019-2021 at their meeting on Sunday.
Anu Sivonen was elected Chairman from Upper Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen was elected Vice-President from Häme.
40 members and 40 alternates were elected to the Board of Governors, the Finnish Youth Associations will be informed on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for their quality and safety.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu offers three promises in its three-year action goals: We keep the doors open for everyone, and we organise equal leisure activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own growth paths," says the Finnish Youth Associations in their newsletter.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and surprised Ferrari: " Lose a very important driver"
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British driver of the Mercedes was asked if he believes that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton during the rest of the season.
Hamilton runs the Ferrari's second driver at the World Cup by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari told us that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he was moving to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen is going to hit the gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change in the remaining games.
He's an exceptional professional... fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has told me before that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian sectional.
From the stake point to the 14th race, Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes is leaving.
The evening paper will follow the race from the moment.
Football A-Yourten Championship Championships became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
Football boys' top league ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
Before the start of the round at 13 p.m., the starting point for the championship battle was clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough for a point against Vasa IFK.
In order for the situation to change in the final round, Ilves, second in the championship battle, must win PK-35 and hope that the Bayers will lose.
In practice, however, the Lahti championship was confirmed even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer vasers, the fight could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the game 16-0.
On a break, the Bayers led from 7 to 0.
One of the reasons for the loss of players in Vaasa is that the team has played part of the same players in the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the men's C block.
Vasa IFK has played practically against the fall of the season in second place.
On Saturday, Vasa IFK will be forced to win JBK in the final round and at the same time hope Tampere United loses its own guest match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno, where the rescue department said there was luck.
The passenger car drifted off the road and ended up on the roof of the Eno at Kovavaarantie on Sunday around 9 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, reported by the rescue department.
Good luck with that, the press release says.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol came to the scene of the accident.
Supo is looking forward to new ways of intelligence: Equipment procurement and recruitment already carried out, there is no hint of foreign planning of operations
According to Antti Pelttar, Head of Supo, the intelligence law has been prepared by means of equipment procurement and training of personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, a permanent increase of approximately EUR 10 million would be added to the subsidy budget.
In the premises of the protective police (supon) located on Helsinki Ratakatu, full head is already being prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, a member of Supo’s team, tells Western Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence.
Serena Williams is startled by a video where she sings topless campaigning for the awareness of breast cancer.
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is shrugging again.
Now he is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video in his Instagram account, where he only sings with his hands in front of his breasts, says AFP.
The song is a 1991 hit by Australian The Divinyls by I Touch Myself.
With this video, Williams supports the Australian Association for Breast Cancer.
"I voted for The Divinyls' world-wide hit to remind women to conduct regular [breast] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this placed me in an area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women, regardless of their skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it plays for many lives.
The other author of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project that has been made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been watched 1.5 million times.
It was released early on Sunday morning.
In the video comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
In the background is the US Open Tennis Tournament three weeks ago.
Williams became hotter at the main judge of the match, claiming, among other things, that men are accepted for much more violent behavior than women players.
A Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not suitable for high-fearers
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant serves magnificent landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located on the cliff.

The rugged landscapes at the heights make restaurant visitors gasp in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to a restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant's bathroom is.
Hiking to a restaurant requires good ground condition, the location is reported.
The alley runs out of Korpela today: This is how it all ends
Everything good ends in time.
Today, this happens to the domestic country drama of Korpela, which has been quite popular.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week the episode was first seen on television by 722 000 Finns.
The top figures in themselves have no practical meaning anymore, as the Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen series are not going to continue.
In the final period the relationship between Charlie and Mirku will take a big leap forward again, and I think Charlie's mother will be the first to guess what's going to happen.
Even between Anssi and Miisa are warm, and in the light of recent events it is quite romantic, but then Laiho shows up again.
The police are also skeptical about the sly man.
Still, no one can predict the fate of Skinny in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, is getting incredible news.
The last will of the distance will be revealed, which will make a woman tear away.
A week later Sunday evenings will continue with the latest episodes of Sorjonen.
The Korpela alley race today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Do you think it's a good idea to go to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
There's a lot of people who don't want to stay home.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go infecting, as the disease can be contagious even if their own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may be infecting others already, even if your own symptoms seem small,” says the Prevention publication.
So you think it's worth staying home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when the person does not have symptoms.
The virus is transmitted one day before the symptoms start and then from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough subsides and the fever is no longer there," says Dr. Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Too fast a return to the gym will slow the recovery.
Also remember to wash your hands, toss the handkerchief and throw the snot papers in the trash.
Sore to move, though?
If you have to leave your home sick, consider wearing a mask.
The mask does not control the viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you can't put your fingers in your nose or mouth," Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited to the mask.
How, then, can we avoid infection?
The best way is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
In the United States, for example, an average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missus tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
The hockey player and the Misses are often connected.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
Alina Voronkova, from Pertunmaa, has been awarded the 2018 Miss Finnish Crown.
The beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Ingrid Finn and her father is a Russian.
Dad's Russian history, Voronkova, was bullied at school.
Mom and Dad have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for being Russian.
In Pertunmaa, I had no friends at all," says Alina at the semifinals of the Miss Suomi competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start off clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the beauty of the beauty found new friends, and the ark went on to roll hopefully.
When you're 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans ranks.
SM league after a career hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days of the affair, the couple lived almost a year in distance, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and get a career out of it, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good trust, and the good thing about distance is that the initial spark stays on us all the time, Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death upon us
Almost everyone is concerned about the earth’s endurance.
Yet there is little desire to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are being sought, but even the theory of a moderate economy faces major problems.
Over the course of a few generations, continued economic growth has brought a standard of living to ordinary people, especially in the northern hemisphere, which could only be dreamed of.
However, the long-standing exceedance of the earth’s carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to destabilise this market economy.
Two men were stabbed on the night against Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at 4 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born less severely in 1968.
The older men are already out of the hospital.
The police have apprehended one person whose potential contribution to the stabbing is being investigated.
The police are also looking for another suspect involved in the incident.
These events are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
An important point for IFK Mariehamn - Interin coach resented the mistake
IFK Mariehamn’s Simon Silverholt goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men’s football league on Saturday.

Silvelholt got through the right side of the ball and happily lifted the ball over the goalie Henry Moisander.
With the guest game, the Mariehamn reached two points to the Turun Ball Society on the spot of the serial marker.
An important goal and a valuable point, summed up Mariehamn’s head coach Peter Lundberg.

We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but fortunately, the goal of the Turku people brought us more into the game.
According to John Allen, head coach of the Home Team Inter, the game was under control, but the goalmaking was painful again.
One flaw in our defense took the jackpot, Allen resented.
We were the best again!

Lehtä showed his underpower skills, but the game is not yet certain.
Jori Lehtä’s strong underpower play came up as his NHL club Philadelphia Flyers played their last training match before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtä fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In the last few days, Lehtä has been on the scene because of suspicions of drugs.

Sam Carchidi, who closely follows Flyers, estimates after the match that Lehtä belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom will be assigned to the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehtä was excellent in the training match.
In the second round, Lehtä fought the puck for himself by force, pulled the defender on him and pitched him into the open position of Raffl, who was waiting for the goal.
For the second time, co-operation between the two brought the goal right at the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season on October 4th with a guest game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenseman Urho Horizontal is waiting for the team’s coaching management to decide whether to join the NHL team.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I think I'm ready for the NHL, the Horizontal said in an interview published on the Boston Twitter account.
In the river boys, the Quadrant played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.

A fresh picture shows a change: The strongest man in the world lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world’s strongest man, is undergoing a striking transformation.
Britain’s Eddie Hall hunted the world’s strongest man’s title for a long and determined time.
Hall could eat as much as 10,000 kilocalorie worth of food a day and, according to Mirror magazine, weighed 200 kilos.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body was not created to be this size," Hall said.
The British were hunting the world's strongest man for victory by all means, and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise, and he was no longer seen at the April 2018 World’s Strongest Man.
In Instagram, Hall recently published a picture of him posing in a much thinner condition than his active career.
Hall writes his present weight is 169.5 kilos.
Hall wrote that he is now training five times a week aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
In addition, Hall does four exercises a week at the gym.
This year, the most powerful man in the world was the Icelander, Hafąór Júlíus Björnsson, also familiar with the Game of Thrones TV series.
The previous Finnish winner is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed on the rocks in Pyhäjärvi - "Soundly caught with rock"
Inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late on Friday night in Akaa Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue department received an alarm about a water traffic accident on Friday night after 9:30.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has drifted to the rocks, and is firmly attached to its bow on the rock, described the on-call fire master Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue department, there was no personal injury.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they are being transported by bus and bus to Tampere, told the on-call chief Jari Nieminen to STT after 1:00 at night.
The port of Viila was alerted to ambulances to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason the ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route to the west of the narrow Jumuse Strait.
The police are investigating the cause of the events.
The on-call fire engineer Matti Willman told me earlier last night that the conditions at the lake are difficult because of the darkness and the rather harsh wind.
According to the rescue department, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship isn't leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now an inland waterway vessel serving as a restaurant ship with a maximum number of passengers of 180.
There is also a private meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers claim unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
The fight against Erkan Teper by boxer Robert Helenius tonight is being followed by a money dispute.
The evening-Sanomat news today about the challenge application submitted by the boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila, where Helenius is charged a total of more than EUR 80 000 in unpaid management fees with interest.
According to the application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius on 15 April 2014-30 January 2015.
We've tried to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done,” Kokkila says to the Evening Sanomat.
The current manager of Helenius, Markus Sundman, sent a reply to the evening paper, which tells the fighter’s view of the events.
Helenius denies his obligation to pay the required amount.
According to the reply, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in an economically difficult situation to Helenius and promised to provide him with matches and sponsorship income.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would be required to pay only percentages of the fees for his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius does not have to pay anything, only receive the income they provide.
This is also normal and the only practice in professional athletes' management activities.
Wage work has never been agreed upon and it would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation," Sundman explains in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to the reply, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not reach the draft until the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal was poor on his own behalf and cut off co-operation with Chefila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought once in his dealings with Chefila and Helmise.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius had been assigned an "indivisible but large" bill for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helmiinen and Kokkila to be a cowardly act, the reply states.
Helenius meets the heavyweight list of challengers of the boxing federation IBF today at Erkan Teper Stuttgart, the seventh.
A Man of Hearts and a Good Journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
At the age of 83, the long-line radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died of incurable liver cancer.
The plotter's obituary was published in Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The report says that Päll died on September 3rd.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the fate of an acquaintance.
She left Facebook earlier, as if goodbye," Ile Vainio says.
Vainio sees Erkki Päll as a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He remembers that Päll was a loved one with a quick mind set and fun stuff.
I got to know Erki as a little boy when I first went to Finn album when I was 12 years old and started there as a storage man.
That's when Erki and I met.
He was then Finnlevy's spokesperson and in various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
As a music producer, there were hundreds of events where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties, doing stories about artists.
He was always expert, and I saw how much fire he had in entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly on the skin of his interviewees.
He was a kind man and a good journalist.
For many, he became a respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote brilliant articles.
Erkki interviewed me several times too.
She was good at talking. She says she's good at talking.
Over the decades, Pälli worked with Toivo Kärje in addition to journalistic work at Fazer.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the biggest passion of Päll was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He did radio work since the 1960s and became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the financial year ended in May showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The Federation describes its economic situation as an experienced 'full turn', although the economy is, of course, burdened by the 'significant debt in the balance sheet'.
Managing Director Mika Kulmala praises the rapid response and tight financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation last autumn as quickly as possible, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning of operations and financial management is instilled throughout our organization, Kulmala explains in the press release.
We have also been very successful in the procurement of partners, and in addition, in the past period of competition, the profits of the world Cups were maximum.
However, in the future, cost management must continue to be precise and, at the same time, we must constantly look for new financing models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
There are dozens of bodies lying in the hospital’s backyard in Palu, on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been assembled to assess the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to post-shocks.
One of the people who was in the hospital area was a 52-year-old Palavian Bahaudin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Bahaudin told the news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris was lying in the yard of the military hospital in Palu. He's been injured in his back and arm.
He was at the start of the quake at the local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to a wedding party in Palau.
I was probably squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, told Haris news agency AP according to the British media.
They're robbing small stores.
Risa Kusuma, the 35-year-old mother of a baby, tried to calm her fevery baby.
He described the moods in the city as tight.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, told Kusuma.
Many of the inhabitants of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboos.
Even if the house is soaring, possible aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the inhabitants under themselves.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners became enraged and set the prison on fire after the guards told them not to go looking for their relatives who suffered from the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first to land a military C-130 carrier that brought relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are allowed only to a limited extent.
The pilots are forced to land on the ground without air traffic control assistance, as the air traffic control tower was badly damaged by an earthquake.
Rain sweeps over Finland at night
On the night against Sunday, the whole country is spreading a long rainy area from the west’s direction, reports the Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but in Central and North Lapland it is expected to run down or snow.
The frosts of the previous night are not repeating, because under the cloud cover temperatures remain higher.
A cloudier night will keep the lowest temperatures quite effectively under control.
Just in the west, you can visit the cold side," said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area moves eastward during the morning.
In the south and west there are pots or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures move up to Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the south and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and wave warnings are in force in marine areas.
No actual autumn storms are expected for the next few days, but otherwise the typical autumn weather will vary.
It's going to be a big fall right now," Ilkka said.
The Miss Finland final is not seen on television

Other representatives of the jury are Jutta Gustafsberg, a well-being entrepreneur and photographer Nadi Hammouda, Minttu Murphy-Kalanen, CEO of Joun's Commerce, and Katja Lintunen, news producer of Seiska.
We were hoping she'd get to college before she went to the beauty pageant.
Russian father Dimitri and Indian mother Svetlana believed her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, the parents of the fresh Miss Alina Voronkova of Finland, proudly followed their daughter's first moments with a crown on their head.
They entered the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the final.
I love the atmosphere!
We believed in Erika the whole time, but half an hour before the arrival, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkerian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells us that as a child, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than her career.
They used to tell Alina when she was so pretty she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina got excited about the beauty contests.
It was the parents' wish that Alina would be admitted to the university before taking part in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina wanted to graduate before she went to the pageant.
We asked him last year why he wouldn't take part, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy food.
And Alina likes to be out there, you can see it.
Alina’s boyfriend Joonas Hurri plays hockey in Japan for a living, and he did not get to Finland to encourage his love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that a young person's relationship lasts for a year.
Yes, that is the intention!
Her parents were hoping her daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break since we've been visiting because of the Misses.
I miss you already, even though you've been texting me.
A young man was killed in a hit-and-run in Lahti. Police caught three people.
According to the police, three people have been apprehended as a result of the incident.
On Saturday, the Häme police did not comment on the course of events and the possible intention of the hit-and-run, arguing that the investigation was incomplete.
Nor did the police comment on whether the persons apprehended and the man who died in the hit-and-run were familiar with each other.
More information on the case is available at the earliest at the beginning of next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - thought of the idea of a comic book: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic fool once left my husband's comment, where he suggested it to a story I developed as a person, says Espoan comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo says that she was an EU economic and legal translator in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been having a great time as a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, "What would you do when you grow up when even the smallest child started to be big?"
Then, in 2014, a comic book came into the picture.
The bishop tells us that he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tintt and Asterix since they were little.
The last time I drew was when I was a kid, but when these Organic Stuff manuscripts began to come into existence, things changed.
At first I wrote a few dozen manuscripts in the drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilled sketch artist, but I was unable to attract her until summer 2016 when I bribed her with a record.
His enthusiasm lasted about a dozen strippers, and then I had to start trying for myself, laughing at Piippo, who says that the drawing board was a great incentive for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to accomplish something.
I didn't even try to draw on the paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
Manuscripts pop into my head all the time, but usually I don't make them all at once.
One strip of three squares takes up to several hours.
I might do one screen at a time, and I'm happy to play with the colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest part, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says that she appreciates Scott Adams Dilbert, among other things, in the modern comics of newspapers.
The characters of the organic blob are the mother of a carrot with a salad hair.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In an organic world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer you a coercive bun, even though the Organic Gnob sometimes pushes the point.
The bishop tells us he reads his series with his husband and children.
After all, it's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book you're drawing and you tell me that this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for a housewife!

The Indonesian earthquake... the air traffic controller sacrificed himself... didn't leave a fissile tower until he got hundreds of passengers safe.
A 21-year-old air traffic controller, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, has become the hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung was left alone in the air - control tower until he was able to safely transport a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an earthquake - shaking island.
The young man was in charge of air traffic control at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others escaped from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before he was able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway to the air.
In this way he could save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Aviation Administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower was shaking and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping off the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe visceral injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation agent told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight reached the air, finally measuring 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Aviation Administration has respected Agung's heroism in social media.
Mr Rehn wondered about Europe's end in a trade war: "We must look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
In the first morning of Yle, Director General Olli Rehn said that, although the tightening of the voltage does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
For the time being, Mr Rehn believes that Europe is a very mina.
It has been able to build peace with the United States and has also helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be at the foot of a trade war.
We'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted sharply to the clear deficit budget presented by the Italian Government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is over 2.4% of GDP.
Mr Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Five per cent of the country’s loan portfolio is problem loans and over ten per cent unsorted loans.
In addition, its public finances are weak and the country seems to be once again overstepping its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps we should not paint new crises yet, Mr Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would lead Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another thing that is testing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would work out.
The difference would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn started as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) will resign in just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, has flashed in the speeches.
Rehn said and added that he is not going to comment on the matter any further.
HS Super Popular Black Box performances will continue next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are for sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the beginning of the week.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23rd Black Box visits Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers on stage during the evening will tell a true story they have prepared for a long time, which has not been published before in any HS instrument.
There's something else in there that I'm sure no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and an addressable story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the public will have the opportunity to meet with the HS journalists and photographers and to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has arranged the evenings of living journalism for three years.
They have been popular from the outset and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have already been in the stands.
The black box was awarded at the Bonnier gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The winners commended a new way of making journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The content of the proposal will be different from that of the evenings this autumn.
The missing sponger was found due to a "unprejudiced experiment"
The Finnish police have the highest drone expertise in the world: "We are being asked for training"
According to the Rector of the Police College of Applied Sciences, the police can use drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example in crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the Oulu police managed to find a lost mushroommaker in Raahe with drone help in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, President of the Police College of Applied Sciences, tweeted about the case and mentioned, among other things, that "by means of an unprejudiced experiment and effective education, we are also the world's leading player here".
Drone is a very new piece of work, and he's even more recent in police work.
There is no record of the Finnish police being the champion of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been explained, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There is a great deal of interest in it elsewhere," says Himberg.
There would be a lot of visitors to watch the Finnish police drone operation.
We're being asked for training.
More and more
Himberg points out that finding the lost in Finland as soon as possible under winter conditions is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained more.
Even now, drone is widely used in police work, and its use is becoming widespread and increasing in the future.
That's what I'd dare say, Himberg says.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police can use drones, for example, in accident or crime scene investigations and in certain types of intelligence.
For example, we already need to check a region a little further, where it is perhaps feared that violence will occur there.
Drone can then be used for preliminary inquiries.
The Rugby of Karelia rose to the First Divar
On Saturday, Rugby of Karelia celebrated the victory of the 2nd Division in Kuopio.
The Joensuuers were still halfway through the match with a 7-12 loss to the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second period they found a plot and porched the guests from the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2nd Division Championship for Rugby of Karelia knew the historic rise to the 1st Division.
In the past, the club has played first, but the Finnish rugby series were divided into two levels, the SM series and several blocks of 1 division.
The Society is going to take the show place, but it will be quite a piece of work next winter.
The current roster of less than 20 players needs to be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the fundraising must also be in line with it.
Eagleniemi starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens in the hockey NHL, confirmed on Twitter that the Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super-promise in Kotkaniemi, 18, in the first round of number three at the summer booking event.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training strength at the end of the summer and has played a strong role in the September training games.
In his first training match, the Eagleniemi was able to score a goal.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish for taking big developments after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL regular season begins next Thursday night in Finnish time.
Montreal will face the opening tour of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader like?
This week a lot has been said about leadership in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, Chairman of Nokia’s Board of Directors, spoke in an interview with HS about her book Paranoid Optimist, where she sheds light on her philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also referred to the inability of the leaders to function as a team; fear and lack of speech, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking and agility of the company's uplifting phase disappeared.
During the week, a business event was also organised in Helsinki, the Nordic Business Forum, which drew the Finnish business cream to the Exhibition Centre.
In addition to Barack Obama, the top 12 stars of the business world came up on stage.
There was enough talk of good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of management doctrines, said that a good leader should dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of a wide range of organic products, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a success book about introverts, said that the most successful leaders are surveyed to be humble.
They acted calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good manager should coincide with the life cycle of the company.
At the beginning of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A mature company needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum were heard by 7,500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were in danger of being informed.
It takes a lot of money to be a good leader.
That's why management often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Silasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other in backgrounds, comrades.
However, they did not wonder if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge from an outsider.
Sara Chafak arrived on a red carpet straight from Los Angeles, spending most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland’s spectacular dress also had a laced sling.
A little jet lag.
I came back from L.A. again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me how he's doing.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for an audition.
Among other things, he has done advertising.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting and similar to that of Finland.
True, he says that work needs to be done even harder, as there is always a replacement for model work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive," Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors' live art award for 30 000 euros in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won a cultural prize worth EUR 30 000 on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, is working on choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have previously been lacking, the jury described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The award is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
The Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for in a major operation: "We can't tell you where"
The extensive search by the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the Øresund and Great Belt bridges.
All land and ferry services from the island of Själlann were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS has reached the shift manager of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
We've found the car we've been looking for.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet," Henrik Storm from the Copenhagen police briefing tells the Evening Sanomat.
According to Storm, the wanted black Volvo doesn't have a direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
An extra Bladet from Denmark told me about a police briefing on Saturday.
The investigator, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime name was being investigated.
Skov said, however, that this is a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
There's been a search for three people in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they've already been apprehended.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen police also watched the events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public at large no longer has cause for concern, as certain people were threatened.
The Macedonian name has led to decades of disunity - now the people are voting on it in controversial elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the agreement between the Macedonian and Greek Governments, the Republic of North Macedonia would be named.
Until now, Greece has blocked Macedonia's attempts to become a member of NATO and the EU with its veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not refer to a new name, but asks whether the voters are in favour of Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by approving the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at a school in the center of Skopje, the capital.
The retired nurse who voted at the school, Olivera Argirosvka, hoped that the agreement would be supported.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This means a change, especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which became independent in 1991, has been officially known as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned to approve the agreement.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is a lot of tension about whether the turnout exceeds the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of the yes votes would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the Constitution.
The agreement still needs to be approved by the Greek Parliament.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m. in Finnish time.
That's a great win!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper
Robert Helenius met Erkan Teper in a heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany late Saturday night.
A 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, next to Stuttgart.

Canada is fighting time to reach agreement on Naphta with the United States.
Time is threatening to run out in the course of negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on NAFTA.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canadian chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus fully on trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago for the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but Canada has not yet reached an agreement.
The United States and Mexico want to bring this agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Mr Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that there are plans to sign the agreement at the end of November, whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to give the US Congress sufficient time to assess it.
The neighbor thought the candles were flashing into a fire in Kaakuri. The fire department was alerted to the scene.
The candles burned in an apartment in Kaakuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night against Sunday.
A dozen rescue units were alerted due to a possible fire in an apartment building.

There was no fire on the target.
After the Honka-HJK game, the police caught 11 people fighting in the field and at the subway station.
The police caught eleven people after the Honka-HJK match in the Men's Football League in Espoo on Saturday, and the police detective Teemu Värtinen of the Western Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and disorder.
Those arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The captures were reported earlier by the Evening Sanomat.
The fight ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed into the field from the HJK audience.
The situation led to pushing and fistfights between team supporters.
One of the things that was needed to put an end to the situation was the Mounties.
In addition to the field, the riots took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures was an unpleasant situation.
According to Värtinen, no crime reports have been reported as a result of the events.
Table stone caught butterfly swimming in the world cup, Laukkanen also swam to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table stone have progressed to the finals on the closing day of World Cup 3/7 competitions in the Netherlands.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone was harassing Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was the second in the first round at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table stone swam in Helsinki during the SE-time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen from Cetus from Espoo was 24.68 in butterfly swimming.
The Swimming Club Vuokatti Laukkanen was the sixth in the early stages of the 50-metre cheststroke at 30.48 and progressed to the finals.
Laukkanen was the 15th in the period 2.14.25.
The students play a rare treat: the ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects their visuality
Ancient tragedies are a rare treat on the Finnish stage.
For example, the National Theatre last seen the ancient tragedy of Sofokleen Filoktes in 1988.
Now the Academy of Theatre brought to the tour of the National Theatre the only drama trilogy of Aiskhylos, Orestetia, that survived as a whole.
In the Stages open! projects that started in 2015, the acting students of the Theatre Academy work together with the professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
His international premiere in Berlin was held in April.
Roiha’s atonement for Orestea sums up the story of the end of the Atreus family’s vendetta and the birth of the rule of law with merit for one hour to twenty minutes, especially by condensing choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of Kirsti Simonlainen's fine Finnish translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the display of the theater pages highlight a simple and clear stage thinking.
Its focus is alternately on the dynamics between choir-exiting, name-starring performers and choirs.
In the performance, both double and triple chairs are used for name roles.
Actors do not leave the stage at all, so, for example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra, who return from the Trojan War, are also shown on the stage, unlike the ancient drama.
Of course, the performance does not highlight its loyalty to the ancient drama.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created before the eyes of the viewer, who is constantly aware of his ritualistic roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing out the rhythmic group of master-level acting students as a close group, even as one organism.
Especially in choir-parts, very expressive, convex group formations, actors are able to exercise their rights on the bare, only the white curtain adorned, on the stage.
Impressive.
The show tour of Oresteia continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrogen truck
The new situation is beginning to emerge in Europe, particularly thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and the Swiss company H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a 1000-car batch of novelty models for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market the fuel cell-powered truck Hyundai continues on the Nexon and the ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology even further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles by, for example, monitoring the development of the gas supply network," said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor, at the launch of the contract.
The fists were fluttering on several occasions in Kajaani
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in the center of Kajaani and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first struck one man inside the restaurant, and as a result he was removed from the scene.
Outside he pushed another man into the country, and in the absence of a third man, the batterer struck him too.
The police picked up the abuser.
At the police station, the man still acted aggressively and kicked another policeman in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to jail to calm down.
The case will be investigated in the form of three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
Another assault incident occurred in the center of Kajaani on Välikatu on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, an approximately 20-year-old Caucasian man hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who hit him earlier kicked the victim.
The outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and the police called.
However, the perpetrators left before the police arrived.
The police ask eyewitnesses of the event to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigation.kainuu@polipolipoli.fi.
Long-line radio host Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, known as a long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of terminal liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is it.
Even the doctor has said that, I live day by day, he comments on his situation in the Evening Magazine a month ago.
The safety of the store's aunts and uncles must be guaranteed
For the first time in 1984, I got paid for a newspaper article.
When these rings of years amaze you with a subject, it is usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karyan, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to the article Erika Kähärä, the working environment expert of the Finnish Trade Union for Services (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us what's really going on.
The problem is growing, even though employers of course claim otherwise.
The police are only aware of cases that are clearly serious and many real violent situations are not reported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to statistics their near-miss situation on the basis of the Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and are not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't end up in the statistics.
In violent situations, there has always been a problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Nevertheless, mental trauma can be much more serious than bruising and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threat of violence is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive intimidation has to be counted as violence - even if there is no assault.
Too many people are afraid of what they're doing at work, even if it doesn't happen.
Some residential areas are restless.
The store's got security.
As shop opening hours were released, the media also had quite a stir in its impact on sellers’ safety.
"Then quite a few employers arranged security services for at least night hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this is producing a new negative trend.
When security kept the incident under good control, the impression arose that it would be unnecessary to guard.
Now, in many places, efforts are being made to find solutions to eliminate costly security services.
Mild assault is a crime of the plaintiff, and it is understandable that a battered seller does not want to make an inquiry about a criminal who usually lives near a store.
However, according to the same paragraph of the 2011 Act, minor abuse becomes a public prosecutor if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time an aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from that hard end of the penalty scale, customs would be cleaned up.
A society in which the grocery trade must be open in small towns almost day and night must guarantee the safety of the shop's employees.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before the live broadcast, "Sara, Iiro is married."
Miss's crowning will not be seen this year in the traditional way on TV, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and the host of Viasat and Viaplay’s NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet is hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before direct transmission, the three host groups informed the invited guests and media representatives who had arrived.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this man host of ours, Sohlberg raved his colleagues while the audience cheered.
The Eturivis competitions are followed by many of the previous years' Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, then Iiro is married!
Sohlberg was sore looking at the Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg pointed to the newly divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though he seemed confused at first.
That's the first time the Sieppi talked about his breakup in the Evening Sanomat weekend paper.
She said that she did not want to open the reasons for the divorce in greater detail in public, because that is between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he's not in a hurry for a new relationship. He's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own business, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone," Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula’s marriage status was brought up at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly referred to Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula as couples.
The host three laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, wasn't he? How did it go?
Janni Hussi signed for a screw-up.
The Northman tortured his tied common-law spouse by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The District Court of Ostrobothnia has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for a number of crimes committed against his common-law spouse to three years in prison.
Among other things, the instrument for committing crime was the belt, cable, and zip ties.
The court condemned the items in question to the State.
He was charged with a suspected aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the District Court.
Four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threats, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and two acts of injury were attributed to the Kokkolan.
Crimes took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the final act, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia handed down its sentence and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in the prison of Vaasa.
There's no evidence of rape.
A 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivation of liberty and of aggravated rape on May 22nd.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court unproven.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public report on the sentence.
According to the district judge, the accused had subjected his or her spouse to violence, threats and coercion in situations where he was bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, fed a strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By its judgment, the court ordered the State to be deprived of the means of crime: the belt and cable, the zip ties, the bathrobe belt, the knife and the shear.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the acts.
It is clear from the operative part that a large proportion of the most outrageous acts took place at the end of the period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old must pay his victim compensation for pain, suffering, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
He hardly has the money in question, since the sentenced person already has debts in his legacy.
It's not the first time a man's incarcerated.
The evening paper does not state the name of the convicted person in order to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district judgment is not valid when writing this.
Europe at the top of four points for the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their leadership in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup on the outskirts of Paris with a score of 10-6, while the twelve double games are still ahead on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four four four ball games that started on Saturday, and in the afternoon’s quadruple the winnings were evened 2-2.
European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had been able to achieve this.
On Sunday, the two of us are looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in one Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have ever gotten more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka game: "Violence is not part of football"
On Sunday, the football league team HJK published a press release condemning the interference of its supporters in Saturday's FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We apologize for events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," says the press release.
At the end of the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Honga’s supporters.
There was also a fight between the proponents.
The organizers were not able to calm the situation down, but the police and the cavalry were needed.
HJK reports in his press release that the team’s players and staff are shocked by what has happened.
Post-match events are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old society.
"We strongly denounce any action that endangers the safety of match events," says the press release.
HJK promises to help the authorities and event organisers identify security threats and eliminate mild phenomena.
Proponent culture is part of football and HJK is important.
We will do everything in our power to support positive, cheerful and encouraging action in football audiences.
"The violence is not part of it," says the press release.
A Philippine inventor flies a drone car to avoid traffic jams.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He's one of the world's growing people now who swears he invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola, however, does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he started developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he's made the first successful test flight... with his device at a height of more than seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope that the device will generate positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Tomorrow’s industrial action will be visible in children’s day care and social and health care services
In the public and well-being sectors tomorrow, the bans on overtime and shift change will be visible especially in social welfare and health services and in day care for children," says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there will not be enough staff on the ground.
Everyone has to wonder how to pick up their children.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services are played and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift exchange due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, not to hire staff, but to work overtime or to change shifts.
This is not yet a collective action.
It is quite the norm, in terms of health and safety at work, that regular working hours are taken care of for each worker and that they are done only.
JHL opposes the government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies from dismissal.
Markku Jalonen, President of the Labour Market for Municipal Employers, does not undertake a prior assessment of the impact of the bans on overtime and shift exchanges.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may be weakened.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so vast, social and health care and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employer," Jalonen said to STT.
Mr Jalonen says that last week there was already experience of similar activities of the Association of Local and Dependent Nurses and the Association of Social and Health Care Professionals Tehy for three days.
Their effects were rather limited.
The ban on overtime and shift exchanges of JHL applies to employees in the fields of municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health care.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the industrial battle affects almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's activities may take a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other collective action if the preparation of the notice law continues.
The government should now admit that it is running into the wall and hard.
The noble believes that both the Ay movement and the government must meet.
That's why it's strange that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the show hasn't been given yet, Jalonen is updating.
The great coral reef is born with the strength of children and adults - the fitness circles of the performance study the gestures of skates and seahorses
The Grand Coral Reef of the collective in other premises was premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from beginning to end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the findings made in the initial exercises.
There's a lot of fairytale magic in theater games for child participants.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation of the work.
However, the great coral reef is not a children’s performance but a performance that adults and children cooperate with.
It provides adults with information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children’s ability to throw themselves into exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
The Great Coral reef is somewhat similar to the saddle ballet, the fitness circle and the nature-related information strike, but it is finally tuned around visits in different, non-human environments.
The Great Coral reef begins with exploring the business lines of corals and coral reef living organisms and fish.
Six different fitness districts learn the gestures of skates and seahorses, among others.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour is made, where music, lights and shiny paints and costumes help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
In the large coral reef there are both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and the coral corals that are being considered.
In addition, we are coral - looking organisms.
Looking and observing in many directions makes the performance dense and life - teeming.
Whether there is a landscape of an organism, an organism that views the landscape, and another organism or landscape that examines the organism at the same time.
For children, it does not seem to be difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the boundaries of thinking and action with its practices, where it is challenging to catch up when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held at Sitratori on behalf of endangered corals.
Disasters beyond man’s understanding should not be allowed to harden, even though it might be difficult to understand the importance of exercising one’s compassion no longer in the face of destructive visions.
Other facilities have built their works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also by means of a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, for which it makes room for wonder and play.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid
Children and young people today are increasingly irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time when they are younger and younger.
In my opinion, children should be children throughout their childhood and not mess with their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at the "boyfriend"'s house this weekend.
When he came to get his drunk sister, he told me about his sexual experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs can't be touched and sex is an adult thing.
I wish today’s children could have a decent childhood and would not have to grow up too early because of group pressure from friends.
On Instagram, I keep seeing younger and younger girls in their pictures wearing makeup and revealing their clothes.
Snapchatt is used in the evening to take and transmit revealing images.
It's harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smart phones when I was a kid.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn’t have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities informed the government that the case of the Helmi of Airisto was not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Yle, the Protection Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation of the Helm of Airisto is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, reports Yle.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else here," Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
According to Yle's data, no evidence has been found so far of a connection to national security, but the investigation is only just beginning.
There is no way of knowing what can be revealed there, one of Yle's interviewees says.
Extensive domestic searches started a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere financial crime or a threat to Finland’s internal security.
Earlier this week the evening paper compiled a case that goes through arguments both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saved Liverpool's lost series
Liverpool’s 100 percent start of the Champion League came to an end, but it was still more satisfied with the team’s 1-1 draw on the Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday it will be exactly a year since Manchester City arrived at the Stamford Bridge and ran off to a 1-0 guest victory.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Champion League that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool's manager Jörgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Champion League with six consecutive victories.
Liverpool started stronger, and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to rule alone after his own end in the field.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a wonderful victory on Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in on it right from the start.
At the 25th minute, he first played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorgenho in a triangular game.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty zone, but he bombed a perfect left-foot bet in the back corner.
Pool's Brazilian watchman, Alison, was a little slow in her fight, and all she could get was her fingertips in the ball.
Klopp must have felt that the defeat position was lightly unfair, because almost immediately Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah’s guidance from the finish line.
In the second period, the Chelsea Vescar Kepa also got to work.
The Basque watch quickly reacted to the draw of Sadio Mané and pushed the ball from the root of the pole into an angle kick.
At the other end, Alison, on the other hand, zeroed the drive through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his concentration.
However, the brass star’s brow turned toward the national teammate David Luiz, who saved the host leadership.
It couldn't take another 89 minutes, either, when Daniel Sturridge was free to fire 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and in honor of it the attacker bombed an irresistible bet on the top corner.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start came to an end at the 1-1 level, but it's still at the top of the league together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also firmly involved in the championship fight with two points behind the tip.
The time-shifting conversation is deep in the potholes
I remember a few decades ago a magazine asked different Finnish influences, which divides the Finnish people.
The only thing left in mind was Juice Widow's answer, the Nen terminal.
Some people's last name has a nen terminal and some don't.
I mean, there could be lines of division anywhere, and here was one of them.
In the EU, Finland has achieved the abolition of the annual clock shift.
Very many people agree that two times a year the shift of clocks has been a job for fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing is now to decide at what time you end up at: the present summer or winter season or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to express their opinions on the Otakantaa.fi page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on Friday 12 October.
There is a heated debate at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say.
Wintertime defenders justify their position with the influence of morning light on people’s well-being and summer time are defended by the influence of evening light on people’s desire to walk and thus on well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
Even research has shown that the morning light rhythmizes a person’s day and gives freshness.
On the other hand, if you do not particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the light will increase people’s movement outside and provide better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I'd rather have both, but bad for our location in the northern part of the earth, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
It is typical of the debate on the subject that one’s own vision is being pushed and the other’s view is being opposed very strongly.
There is little to listen to, because the most important thing is how you feel about yourself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, there is little point in trying to turn the other’s head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy to debate, because it does not require a great deal of effort, and it is enough to justify it.
Similar types of issues are usually debated with the strongest and equally infertile.
I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I think you'll agree with that.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat, if life feels sad.
Josba fought a close foreign victory
Josba’s first guest game in Salibandy’s Divar produced a full three-point series against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki with a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo was still in the finish line at the beginning of the third round, but Josba sought compositions and recycled men in chains.
In 50.47 the brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5-winning goal.
When both teams were stalling, crucial minutes were played in the stable.
Josba’s most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
Chain two was also firepower when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) were also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second line at the time of her goal.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next person to meet is O2-Jyväskylä, visiting in two weeks.
At Uncle's church on Sunday, the 200th birthday party.
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow in some very sad moods.
The arson of the Church of Excitement one week ago was a shock.
Uncle's church was also guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a celebration.
Even if no one wants to do so, the Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other alliances in the world.
Family Mass starts at Uncle's church today at 10:00.
Then we go to the parish hall at the Karelian banquet table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, both inside and outside.
For example, you can get to know the church building with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has been a retired parish master for 37 years.
The celebration of the church’s birth also marks the end of an era.
The church house, which was already abandoned in 1982, will keep its doors open for the last time today.
We are now in evasive spaces at the former municipal hall," says Markku Koistinen of Kappa.
The parish hall was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk withdraws from the position of leader of the Tesla government - Fraud charges were settled for $40 million.
The electric car manufacturer Tesla and the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, have agreed their case with the US Securities Regulatory Authority (SEC).
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he set up.
However, Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to resign from the position of Chairman of the Tesla Board for three years.
The company will have to hire an external board president.
Musk will also be subject to stricter supervision.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent managers and to monitor Muski's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk will each pay $20 million (about EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market failures and harm to Tesla's shareholders", says Director Steven Peikin from the SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secure.
The tweet temporarily increased Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
According to the agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the company’s other management or potential sponsors.
In practice, Musk was accused of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC stated that it was demanding that Musk be fined and that he be prohibited from acting in the management of listed companies.
The SEC's challenge scared the investors, and Tesla's stock went into a strong decline.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian quake and tsunami
The number of people killed in the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, reports the country’s disaster agency, AFP.
It is believed that the death toll will continue to increase, as the damage is still to be solved.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may reach thousands.
Friday’s earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
Tsunami was given a warning immediately after the quake, but it was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are at least for the time being Plus.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already many people are known to die.
Calls for Assistance From Ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived at the disaster area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the focus of the rescue work is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to still have between 50 and 60 people in its ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue services agency, reported that one person was found alive in the ruins of Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular hotel for business travellers.
We also heard people asking for help, he told us.
According to Syaug, heavy clearing equipment would be needed quickly in the earthquake and tsunami areas.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and in the neighborhood.
My friend's family are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked because of the deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
Interferences had access to the telephone numbers of ministers, among other things.
It was an application used at the British Conservative Party Assembly in the government.
For example, Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Boris Johnson, former Secretary of State, were the subject of harassment.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the application's lack of encryption, the public was able to access the politicians' profiles that were in the MAP of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public had access to profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
The profile logged in to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile for a moment to make a pornographic and title abuse.
Michael Goven's profile was changed to a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to log in to other people’s profiles with their email addresses.
Then the login can look at the contacts of the profiler and send messages in his name.
The meeting application made the telephone number of every journalist, politician and participant public," Foster criticized.
The conservative spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) supports the data leak.
The application was developed by the Australian company Crown Comms.
The Labour Party in the opposition criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in matters of security.
Every week there are a large number of applauding Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland
Watchful viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The Wall, a fast-spread U.S. format, landed in the Finnish version of Four last Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Heikki Paasonen, is filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio the possibilities for photography were exceptional, as the large 12-metre high gaming wall required space for the space.
During the start period, a studio audience of the program was raised in the social media, who was thought to be Polish.
On Twitter there would be a debate about whether Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about a game to play in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, the head of the four domestic programs, is illustrating the matter to Evening Magazine.
He says that the studio audience includes close players, other Finns living in Poland and Polish viewers.
The audience is made up of international clappers in Finnish production, just as the audiences of The Wall episodes in the same production space in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called professional audiences, who go to different programmes, Sormunen backgrounds.
He reminds us that following a game in itself is not so difficult, even if he does not understand the language in which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish between red and green balls falling off the wall.
However, for foreign-language speakers, there are interpreters in the studio who do the translation.
There are two interpreters who interpret for the studio director as a simultan interpretation all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of slaps are going on there, for example, and what the situation is going on," Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was delivered recently in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff participated in Talent Finland's filming in Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly receiving a simultan interpretation into his ear and knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the shoots, the sum of Sormune.
The typhoon that broke the southern parts of Japan is moving towards the main islands - authorities warn against landslides and floods
Authorities also warn against possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the typhoon Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided and there is no record of fatalities so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Company, people have been evacuated to shelters and electricity has been cut from more than 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are in some places stopped because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there will also be heavy winds and rains.
Train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to weather scientists, Trami torments Japan until Monday.
The sky of the ace became darker and darker
It's been a bad start.
The sky was almost black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Porians now have five consecutive losses, with a total of two points for six rounds.
No Ässi defenseman or two lower chain player has scored yet.
The pressure is increasing, too.
At the point of almost half of the game, the audience left the hall against Sport.
Six games have just been played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to worry, because that's what we played weakly.
Especially the performance of the second round was embarrassingly bad," Jarno Kärki, who made the power for Ässi 1+2 told.
Sport naturally enjoyed winning.
The team had a game under it from Friday, so you would have thought it would show up in the making.
Maybe it did, but the Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen wonders about the audience of the event in the big hall.
Somehow it was thought that maybe not so many people would come this year," Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Finnish Traders’ Championships were held together with Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations would be that the number of audiences could even fall slightly from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were blocked before ten, the sellers reported that the products had stopped, the news porridge was sold more than before, and Hyvärinen heard that there was an increase in the number of cars.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, says Hyvärinen later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon, five hours had a particularly large number of programs for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to a record number.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach an even longer time.
The sellers also curve to Liperi from a larger area every year.
This year, nearly a hundred rapporteurs, handicrafts, pastries and harvesters had arrived in the bread shop.
The mother of Bread Day Pirkko Hyvärinen admired the audience from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the day of bread, the harvest was blessed.
In the children’s series Teija Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
Eleven different types of bread arrived for the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the Martto pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you will recognize a good lamp
Bring space to life, create the right atmosphere for interior decoration and read the book without tiring your eyes.
You might want to invest in good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokinieemi, Sales and Marketing Director of Innolux.
Do Your Eyes a Ministry
Lighting is growing in importance, the more years of age are behind it.
Sufficient light can be used to help with problems that many experience with age when vision is reduced and dazzling more and more people suffer.
Olderly, the need for light is also growing.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
It is therefore worth investing in the light-manufacturing effects and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but not dazzles, something tells me.
Create Beauty Around You
The beautiful interior can only be seen with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
The favourite is the elude, Scandinavian and Japanese Japanese Japanese Japanese style.
On the other hand, modern and playful retro style with strong colours, metal with different shades or ice cream colors, inspired by the 70s, has also risen to the boom.
Authenticity fascinates you in the same way as in other interior decorations in the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more investment is now being made in the home than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want a tailor-made, bold luminaire with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very designer-conscious," says Jokiniemi.
It is not necessarily the latest trend light that will be purchased at home, but a timeless classic for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, elegant and elegant classics hold their ground year after year," Jokinieemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
Kokoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of the Kokoko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are dissociating.
The Canadian attacker played three league games in the orange black, without power points," Kookoo says in his press release.
O'Donnell moved to Kooko in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period for the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old attacker played at KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and at the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no word of O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling - things go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic turns to paper
A special game movement The player now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of Stonefoot Shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online stores are packed in packages from importers, for example.
All packages coming to us will be reusable.
We may use the boxes about ten times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used," says Ville Puurula of Oulu’s Player.
As plastic material, the company mainly uses newspapers and similar recycled materials.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we're supposed to move on to recycled material even in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It also saves money when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is natural for the player’s operations, as in addition to new products, the key product range of the shop includes used games and equipment.
Acquisition of every fashion-conscious person: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work in a costume from one season to the next.
They create the basis of a good garderob with their multifunctionality, as it is easy to assemble different costumes around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality sweaters.
This category also includes the black polo.
A black sweater made of natural material, polo collars cannot have a false purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight trousers, tulle skirts and jeans, and it can be combined with both a discreet outfit and a snotty style.
The polo sweater is suitable for both a youthful modern dresser and a classically sophisticated stylistic artist.
This is how you create style.
Autumn’s trend look comes from golden brown and wide-footed corduroy pants, black polo sweater and grey anklets.
The classic polo sweater together with other classics, blue-green Scottish-screen skirts and wine-red loapers form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Bring it to the black polo sweater by combining it with a relaxed trendy garment: jeans, high boots and thick pantyhose.
Young and classy!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the foreign intelligence of the Russian Federation, the SVR or the military intelligence GRU, have abandoned this course of action.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and reconnaissance.
The agents of the USSR Security Service in Western countries have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasiili Mitroth (1922-2004) who has defected to the west of the KGB.
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired for the DRG groups the uniforms and accessories of the Bundeswehr, the railways, game guards and road workers for covert operations.
This trik was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, set up checkpoints on roads from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
Cold War agents were hiding in sabotage teams supplies containing mines, explosives, detonators, and communication equipment.
In 1998 there was still a KGB stash in Switzerland that was blown up by a trap mine when it was sprayed with a water cannon by the authorities.
The police caught four drunk drivers in the county last night.
The police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Contiolahti blew 1,57 per mil.
At 3:30 in the morning, he drove two passengers at the beginning of the Kajaanis.
A 19-year-old local man who was alone in the car blew 1,54 per mil according to the police.

HPK keeps Risk in its ranks for the rest of the season, Lehtinen’s trial period ended
Mika Toivola, the sports director of HPK Hämeenlinna HPK, says that Philip Riska (in the middle) has been important to the team in the first steps, in the underpower game and in the defensive role of field four.
Filip Riska, who played during the trial period in early autumn, continues in the HPK in Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to her convinced the Society’s leadership.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, in the underpower game and in the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK’s sports director Mika Toivola commented in the Society’s press release.
According to Toivola, the value of Risk will rise when the Ice Hockey League’s solution games are played.
Riska, from Pietarsaari, has played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport.

True story today on TV: The climber was left to die twice
The American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on his own experiences.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest is now getting his premiere on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm caught climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's guidance for 2015 is about the battle for survival, which has been dealt with in a grainy way.
Tragedy has been made into movies... and documents... before.
Real events are also being investigated in this case.
22 years ago, the world’s highest mountain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions — Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was the guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could be saved by an eye surgery performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of that and atmospheric pressure, he lost sight, which was why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall went on and never came back.
However, Weathers’ struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and could no longer find his way back to the camp.
When they came looking for him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
They left Weathers to die.
But like a miracle, he got on his feet and found the others.
The worst frozen Weathers were still thought to be dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
It's obvious that against other expectations Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, fellow climbers too began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
In the movie Beck Weathers is playing Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrate the 200-year-old Eno Church.
Uncle's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on the church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and in honor of the centenary year, the whole family’s feast was prepared for Sunday.
The party started at 10 a.m. at the family fair on Eno’s church hill, after which the Karelian banquet table has been served at the Eno Parish Hall.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family messoon.
Uncle Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to the work," says Iron Mountain (in the picture).
Many have been touched by the fire of the Church of Excitement, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno Congregation.
Eno Church is now the oldest of the Evangelical Lutheran parishes in Joensuu after the Church of Kihtelsvaara was destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, there was a devotion in the danger of excitement, where the church that was destroyed in the fire was silenced and remembered.
Photos and videos: The Medican flashed his power in Greece - The sea disappeared and the street became a river
On Saturday, a powerful hurricane - type autumn storm came from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, has been named Zorba.
The Greek Air Science Institute has issued a red weather warning for Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Kykladie and Crete.
The pictures taken from the area show plenty of floods all over Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows the sudden appearance of a river, not a street, but a flood, in the town of Kiato in Corinth.
The second video shows how the car has been carried by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, heavy winds caused strong sea traffic.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their Facebook pages to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The delegation calls for the follow-up to weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even a flood risk.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011, medicans occur only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically around September/October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The current storm left floods in Tunisia and Libya before moving north and towards Europe.
There is also concern in Greece about refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper shelter.
In the summer, the storm will also be hit by areas destroyed by fires in the vicinity of Athens.
In Greece, the Medican was also raging last November.
We should not go to the sea now, but flights on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands threatened by the autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, it is advisable to be careful not to hit a storm with branches or other bulk.
These guidelines have been distributed to more than 3,500 Finnish people who are on holiday through Sun Trips in Greece during the weekend.
The instructions will be needed, for even storm Zorbas is predicted to beat up the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speeds can rise up to 45 meters per second in gusts.
Heavy rains add to the despicability of the weather.
According to tour operators, all those who have made their phone numbers to Greece through the Sun Trips and Tui have been warned by SMS about harsh winds.
Still, the sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, an expert on solar travel communications, Saturday by the beginning of the evening, the resorts have avoided the worst.
For example, flights have landed and taken off according to normal schedule.
Of course, we're monitoring the situation all the time.
We're going first. We're going first.
I supported the media officer Antonia Schroderus, who says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our personnel on site.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the early evening on Saturday.
In the most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, there are currently over 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is likely to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had been shining on Rhodes, and the temperature was up to 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C], says Ikonen of the Solar Trips.
It is estimated that Zorbas will become the next Turkish nuisance, albeit somewhat less so.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, for example," says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvisen and Janni Huss have identical evening gowns in the Miss Finals - this is how they react to the situation.
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived for the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-back evening dress.
Hussi says she got a dress from Meslewi.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a wonderful dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver evening dress had also been chosen by the host Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their uniforms and looked at the situation with laughter.
Karvinen told the Evening-Says he got busy in preparation, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi is a backstage and red carpet host at the Miss Finals, and he's talking to the front-row stars coming in.
Huss has a recent move in since he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for the time being. Let's see what happens.
The essential thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before he moved, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress erupted, I had a cold, but otherwise the vacation was really successful,” Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention, gathering curious eyes from senior citizens.
The host and Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen of 2016 told us on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final that she had enough to do with the radio plots and Love Island Finland photos.
There has been so much urgency that Karvinen arrived at the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I put on makeup and I put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
In the evening dress change at home, Garfield laughs.
Garvinen says he pulled out his makeup among pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people looking at me in the mirror.
At least everyone else thought it was funny to wear makeup.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
At Marbella he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience so far as to be a stoppage.
Garvinen says he went to say hi to the singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They're people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the show.
How am I supposed to wear over-generation boots?
Three Perfect Exemplary Suits
Classic clothes are clothes that work in a costume from one season to the next.
Classics are often decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, the over-generation boots that became the hit shoes of the autumn and winter season have gone nowhere.
According to their name, the boots that reach the knee repeat in style from year to season.
Showy boots share the opinions of users, but a bold model is worth a try, no - bold.
Indeed, the boots of the generation fit into any outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, girl, or tights, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
The long boots look good in both the holiday log and everyday costumes.
Black overcrowded boots are also very suitable for delicate outfits.
They appropriately balance the feminity of a pink, flowery plideer skirt and a tender, rich sweater.
A fresh but autumnly stylish everyday dress for a romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is created by long copper brown velvet, over-generation boots, spectacular earrings and a nitpick bag.
Although the boots have a certain fineness, they also fit perfectly into a casual everyday dress with a T-shirt, long shorts and trendy cap.
It's so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They travel for the rest of the year and pick up passengers," the City of Espoo informs.
The Otaniemi robot cars play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area will start traffic on a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show us how robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robot cars run completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger on board.
The vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several different sensors and assessing whether the road is free.
If not, they will interpret whether the observed obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or, for example, snowflake, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4 for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: Tuesdays from 1 pm to 3.30 pm, Wednesdays from 10 pm to 3 pm and Thursdays from 10 pm to 3 pm.
Robot cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
The stops in the robot cars are identified by the signs on the stop.
The most secure way to get aboard is from the stop number 1 on the Otakaari.
The bass player of the band fell off the stage in the middle of the show and got hurt
The Mokoma group informs on their Facebook website about an unexpected situation at the Tampere Pakkahuone concert.
The show of the Mokoma band at the Pakkahuone in Tampere took a dramatic turn on Saturday when band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage in the middle of the performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the evening.
The twilight's wrist was broken.
The band's on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped off the stage in the Packroom last song and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour's gigs will be done with backup, the pages will read.
The fans of this country respond with concern to the photo update, where the bassist Santa lies with a plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news has been awaited, it was quite a worry how badly it happened.
The relief is great. Fortunately, the bones heal over time.
Come on and get back to Santtu and have a good tour for the rest of the band plus a replacement!
And thanks for last night, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave out such a strong dramatic show in the future, right?
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo.
The main focus of supervision was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected for a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state soils.
In addition, licences for the possession of hunting weapons and the permitted quantities of self-loading weapons used in chicken bird-fowl were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance and only one hunter was found missing the required hunting permit.
12 daily fines were imposed on the hunter for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, 133 drivers were blown by the police, two of whom are suspected of being drunk driving.
In addition, patrols handled five traffic offences in a fine procedure, police times.
To sum up, hunters are very much in compliance with the permit for hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mr Mykkänen is going to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of Interior Kai Mykkänen will be travelling to Turkey in the next few days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees to Finland this year from Turkish refugee camps.
Selection trips usually take place a couple of times a year, including representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey conducting interviews.
The UN Refugees Organisation (UNHCR) first selects particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered particularly vulnerable in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
More people are elected to the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some people will not arrive for different reasons.
On his way, Mr Mykkänen also meets with the Turkish Minister for the Interior, Süleyman Soylu and Syrian NGOs.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
We're talking about raising the quota.
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years the quota was 1,050 a year, but there has since been no government agreement to increase it.
The Coalition Party has been in favour of raising the quota, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) recently proposed a gradual increase of the quota to between 1 500 and 2 000 people per year.
During this term of government, the silent visit is the first that the Minister of the Interior makes on the spot to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous Home Secretary Petteri Orpo (C.E.) and Paula Risikko (C.E.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going off the grid... and we don't know if we're gonna cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday, a Karelian reported on a bill to amend the Animal Protection Act.
The article gave the impression that the draft law in principle prohibits the keeping of all animals as farmed animals, pets or other business activities which are not specifically authorised by ministerial decrees.
In other words, everything else is, in principle, prohibited except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If the bill ends up being a law, then it should mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities which endanger the security or good manner of society.
In principle, we are now introducing a ban on any activity which is not expressly authorised by law or regulation.
This change means that nothing new can be tried out in business, for example, and nothing else can be done until the law or regulation approving it has been adopted.
In general, the government's activities in drafting the law have been weak.
If we now go down the road that, in principle, everything that is not permitted is forbidden in Finland, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Protection Act will require an update.
But a legal project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept this 'everything is forbidden, which is not expressly permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully, there will be a sensible minister who will suspend this kind of legal project.
Metti Forssell tips: Autumn’s four trendiest skirts
This autumn's trendy clothing comes in snake bumps.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Combine the snake-like skirt with the more restrained tops, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to keep the overall outfit classy.
This autumn there is plenty of silk, and silk skirt in particular is one of the trendiest clothing items in the season.

For example, the combination of squares and ballwork is beautiful.
Asymmetrical hems are a breeze of light summer, which can be taken with them until autumn.
At the same time, the asymmetrical hem is feminine and playful and is perfect for everyday life as well as for celebration.

Turkey is urged to charge mobile phones in case of a storm
The storm Zorba in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, Meteorologists warned in particular the seamen, fishermen and farmers on the west coast of the country about the Greek storm, reports CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to travel along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
On Saturday, the disaster and emergency authorities called on citizens to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that the internet is operational so that people can receive timely updates, says the local news agency Anadalu Ajansi.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from windows and move garden furniture out of the way of the wind, for example.
A heavy rain is expected in Turkey and the wind is expected to blow between 28 and 33 meters per second.
In Greece, a red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for Attika, Peloponnesus, Ionian Islands, Kykladie and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned the Finns in Greece about storm Zorba.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were invited to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, the wind was heavy and it was raining.
People were calm, and Laura Aaltonen, Communications Manager, from Tui Travel Agency, told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any messages from Finns in distress either.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, reported Amna, a local news agency.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, the travel agents were informed to the STT.
According to the Finnish delegation in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and shipping were expected.
Finnair was informed on Saturday that the weather situation was actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrar Kimi Räikkönen was allowed to admit that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russian GP time.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven and with their teammate Sebastian Vettel clearly left out of Mercedes.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
They asked the ratty what caused the sudden fall from Mercedes' ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are. That's how simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know any more than anyone else does.
This is always speculation, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
A rare treat was seen in the time periods for Sauber in Räikkönen's future stable.
Next season, Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen on Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson reached the last time-driving session.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place to leave is best for more than three years.
And even though in the second driving session as many as five drivers failed to drive completely, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging Räikkönen in view of the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were in the early season, then the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it. Robert Helenius knocked out Erkan Teper. "Robbe is back."
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match in Stuttgart's evening progressed steadily.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he didn't get a good shot.
Clearly, Helenius controls the match with hard series that found their way.
The Finn was also clearly in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth period when Helenius knocked Teper down on the left.
The hit was so hard that the guy who fought in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In the ring interview, he first praised the good atmosphere and opponent created by the audience.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius rejoiced right after the fight.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
There might be a chance to even get to the World Cup, Helenius commented to the Evening Magazine before the match.
Instead, the loss could have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
This isn't getting any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before he met Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the country calls for a clear rise in the number of victims.
According to the country’s vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Difficult Circumstances
The rescuers are looking for trapped and also dead in the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: the Port of Palu and its neighbouring Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Plus, and the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say that they heard the cries of the people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of grubbing-up equipment has delayed the start of the rescue work.
The Indonesian president, Mr. Widododo, has ordered the military to do rescue and grubbing-up.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications are cut out in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
The hesitation and long reflection of the Miss Finland finalist led to a mockery
The new Miss Finland is currently being selected at Billnäs Ruuki.
Each Miss Finalist was asked a question during the interview.
The finalists asked the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, hesitated to answer the audience there caused sweet but benevolent laughter.
The question to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book was read by the Miss Finalist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a long time before he began to hesitate.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is... Anttikoski said with thought.
A pause in the audience caused laughter until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've ever read is...
I've read books at school!
It's probably something about economics.
So the last book I've read is an economist, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a fresh applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the miss tour, Anttikoski drew attention because he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9 p.m., when the crown will be abandoned last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue away.
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples from behind, for the domestic apple is at shocking prices in the store.
You might have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people are already growing that pear tree.
This cake can only be made from apples if you do not want to buy pear.
Of course, the flavor is more varied if you add the pear to the cake.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed homes.
Cut.
You can melt in a pot.
Shake the eggs and sugar to foam and then add cornmeal and melted butter to the foam.
Combine the corn starch or maizena and baking powder and add them to the dough.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread dish with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the dish, and spread pear slices on top of sugar.
Sponge half of the dough over the pear slices and apple slices over the dough.
Sponge the rest of the dough over the apple parcels.
Cook in the oven at 180 °C for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let it cool down in the pan and then turn it down on the serving dish.
Just cut the cake properly when it's cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and is easily crumbed because the dough contains almond and cornmeal without gluten.
Ruka will host an international crime literature event in January
In January, the first international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held at Ruka in Kuusamo.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers and jazz music.

In addition to Swedish names, the event also includes writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers at the event are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the organisers of the festival, the northern location, nature, dark season and the unique surroundings of Kuusamo provide a framework for unique written experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
The researchers at the University of Sydney have outlined two types of "coolness" of slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolness and, in part, dissident coolness.
Attractively, according to researchers, the cool people had many features that were considered socially desirable: outward, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterised by distance, independence, rebellion and edge.
They craved experience and cared little for outside evaluations.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardy is not cool: high status in teens does not necessarily lead to success in later life.
So says the United States study published in Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who dated early, partyed, sought out good - looking crowds, and sought the popularity of others, had an increased risk of drug abuse and delinquency as young adults.
In their relationships, they were less able to cope than their peers were ever more inconspicuous.
High-status luukos, designer bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least genuinely attractive.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science magazine in August, most people were more prepared to make friends with the average supermarket shirt than with those wearing a branded shirt - despite the fact that most people chose a brand shirt when they visited.
If you're in the Greek resort islands, watch out!
There's a typhoon coming up, a weather warning screaming red.
During the weekend in southern Greece it can rain as much water as in Finland on average during the six months.
The storm Zorbas hits Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Kyklaads, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens announces it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported in the weather service foreca’s blog.
According to it, the storm’s toughest gusts are as high as 45 meters per second.
Because of comparison, the storm Kuisma, which beat Finland from the beginning of the week, blew at its hardest by over 31 meters per second.
According to the blog, however, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
On the weekend in southern Greece, more than 300 millimetres of water can come.
It corresponds to about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused floods in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize Love Island Finland, drooled by men?
Appears on confusing YouTube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, Aku, a beauty drooled by several men, also performs on strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In the videos Anku advises craftsmen, among other things, to produce an octopus from an old roll of paper towels.
Anku also shows his sympathetic style how you can work a hedgehog out of tights and grow the right spikes.
Now let's get the Easter grass to grow, but let's do it a little unexpectedly, Anku insinuates and presents sawdust, pantyhose and freshwood seeds that he makes hedgehog.
You can watch videos from below or from Ankun YouTube from here.
Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursting with adrenaline in Sochi, is he going to be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking for tens of minutes after his Russian gp pole drive when he was in front of the media.
The fine round left Lewis Hamilton, the number one star of Mercedes, behind and was certainly a spiritual criticism of the Finnish driver who collected this season.
It's a nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the solution round.
Feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on a stake once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so it's been quite a while.
This track has been good to me before, and I got good rounds again.
It's not easy to miss the Sochi track, so it's a particularly big part of the race.
And of course, Bottas had to answer questions about whether he was going to win tomorrow or whether he was going to win the World Cup title in front of Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the pole, there can be no other goal, Bottas impaled.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' management to Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference to me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
We'll see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was genuinely happy with the success of Bottas after driving, and Mercedes’ stable boss Toto Wolff also enjoyed it.
Lewis had a plan to win Valtteri, but he couldn't make it to the 7th.
Valtteri knows he's gonna have to tear it all apart to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that the adrenaline burst out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
Whether the stables allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive honestly, Wolff replied dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen, a member of the Kitele, won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship series ended rarely.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done in the final rally around Turku and Salo by the Tuusulaites Eerik and Henrik St Petersburg, because Eerik won SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen, from Kitelainen, ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the final race sealed the Finnish Championship in the SM4 category of two-wheeled cars.
Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civic, started the Turku sectional due to their clear starting points: an investment in the top group would guarantee the Finnish Championship title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to compensate when some of the extra lights failed with another special experiment.
It was a pretty blind spot for the third part.
In a situation like that, you don't want to be a fool.
On Saturday, only Jussi Tepo was following the pace of the second series," Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and he says that the war against terrorists is 'almost over'.
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven - year war.
Over 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting with the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey is scheduled for October.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV.
The Supreme Court candidate judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassing him, got an exceptional number of people in front of the screens.
In the United States, the appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge at full power brought at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasey Ford, a California professor who accused him of harassing him, were in front of the Senate judicial committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary results, the consultations were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, the online consultation followed several million more.
NBC reported that 6,8 million people followed live streaming and CNN reported that it had reached its record of 8.2 million live broadcasts.
The CNN will rise by more than 10 million, including those who followed through Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also made it to 8.0 million.
Digital start-ups are channels' own, TV viewers come from Nielsen, a research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they will be dizzy anyway.
Not many people reach 20 million.
In the United States, more than 20 million admissions are usually limited to sports matches and the great Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, it's a long way from the U.S.'s most watched annual show, the American Football League NFL final match at the Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year Trump’s first speech to Congress was, according to Nielsen, a total of nearly 48 million people and a total of 30 million people took part in the inauguration.
Top priority
The appointment of a Supreme Court judge in the United States is an extremely important case, since the posts are for life.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to prevent the then President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
Another place opened up when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was the so-called "scale language" on a number of issues, whose vote could determine the position of a nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015 he decided by his vote that same-sex persons were entitled to a marriage right in the whole federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his heels.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock down the right to conservative superiority for decades.
Children have the right to get their information to parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children’s health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Originally, of course, the situation in Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health records or recipes of infants.
A temporary correction was introduced in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing amount of time to repair them.
Now we're in the process of repairing in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a case-by-case.
Then the layman’s understanding is about the push of the button: now that the wire is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has a bank account or an official ID card.
But how many ten-year-olds have?
The ID card is chargeable, and a ten-year-old can't even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the fourth grader’s data except by asking for it in print.
It is not so much a matter of parental rights as of children's rights.
It is extremely important for the child’s care that the parents can be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be ensured.
Even underage people can have family situations where not all things can be freely spoken about.
Often they are related to sexual health, which is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI started to clean up the harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to American media, the FBI is investigating the harassment charges of at least two women.
One of the women was before the Senate Committee on Justice earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The investigation shall not take more than one week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not become public.
He threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajaani.
The captured brawler continued to bludgeon at the station.
The police say they put a man in a police prison "to calm down."
The police were threatened by a suspected abuser on the night against Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities report a case that originated when a well-balanced 30-year-old man was in a violent fight at a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When the third party tried to intervene, he hit him too.
Triangulation led to the call of the police.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, the police will tell you.
The suspect was still acting aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police say they sent a man to a police prison to calm down.
He's suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
Aid organizations are preparing to start work at the Sulawes in Indonesia - "The clean water is the most urgent"
The UN Children’s Organization, UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes, Indonesia,” says Kirsi Haru, Head of Information at the UNICEF.
The local authorities are conducting rescue work, but the need for further assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
In the town of Palu, Sulawes, rescue operations are underway, but in the area of Donggala a little further north the situation is less clear.
There are still places where communications don't work.
The aid measures are difficult because the roads are also cut off, says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often light - built, so the damage caused by the earthquake and the tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they will need shelter... for example, tents and clean water at first.
Clean water is the most urgent in times of crisis.
The first thing most people can do is offer water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in storage.
Efforts are being made to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is transported to the first emergency by trucks, for example.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and the reunification of families is one part of Unicef's mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is a part of the UN.
In the initial phase, the funds previously raised will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already started to raise funds to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of Tesla's Board of Directors, ends a $20 million fine for tweets.
Elon Musk, founder of space rockets and electric cars companies, avoids fraud charges through an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends his duties as chairman of the board of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to a fine of $20 million.
Mr Musk resigns as part of an agreement with the US Securities Regulatory Authority.
By agreeing Musk avoids fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission, the SEC, threatened Musk with securities fraud because of the tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing to withdraw Tesla’s electric car company, which led to a rapid increase in the company’s share price.
According to the agreement, Musk is not allowed to chair the Tesla Board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board of directors and include two "independent directors" in its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Muski's communications.
Musk can still be CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, Tesla also has to pay the equivalent fines of 20 million to the financial supervisor.
Tweets Misleaded Investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the financing by which Tesla would be bought back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
Billionaire tweets say the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420.
After tweets, Tesla's share price rose by more than ten per cent in the day, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Muski's claims had no basis whatsoever.
According to the overseer, he had not really negotiated what he claimed to be funding.
Furthermore, he had not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with any other management team or the board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14 percent when the SEC announced a fraud charge.
It is expected that the agreement on the news will strengthen the company's course again.
The final verdict is not the reason.
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical flaw.
The clock of the Helsinki Cathedral Tower has stopped.
The wise men point at twelve o'clock.
The situation is like a mediocre horror movie: while the crypt of the church would be exorcised and the organ would sound on its own.
Of course, this is not the case; the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have broken down and a new part is expected, says Suntio Evelina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account.
In fact, it is mentioned in the account that the final sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen tells me the church bells don't ring because of the fault.
