A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a San Francisco shopping mall.
Only recently a 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at the Westfield shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfrancisco Frank Galicia, reports San Francisco Medical Office.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a homicide.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job as a chef at San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and tight team, like a family.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia reports that Frank first lived in the hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend," told Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and with a great heart.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the river.
Despite all the injustices in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about this case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department tip number 415-575-4444.
Strikers ’ Junior Doctors Call for New Industrial Struggle
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and have requested permission for further industrial action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is in the process of requesting the support of its entire government for further industrial action from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA during the vote in July.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter on Twitter to JDC members, saying that the government 'suffocated' on the questions that Mr McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter reads: "In the light of this, the JDC Government has voted against a completely new proposal for a treaty and calls for further formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Government has submitted a formal request to the BMA Government asking for permission for gradual expansion of industrial action since the beginning of September."
Because of the controversy, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete shutdowns ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawana, director of BMA junior doctors, resigned after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions that BMA had recommended.
At the meetings before the vote, Malawia told BMA members that the agreement was good and should be approved, 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement will come into force and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and to bring to an official conclusion the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides did shake hands.
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't see much heat coming out of him even by his own reserved standard.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr Putin — five times according to a report.
I couldn't keep count myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his zeal just the opposite.
But Putin’s constant coolness showed that the Russian client has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event was fierce.
Putin, in strict words, attacked Duckara and accused him of stabbing her in the back.
The insult was even greater because it came from an assumed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to regain real confidence.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, government-controlled media campaigned against Ankara in a thorough and aggressive way.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the allegations made by top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in Isis - controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the charges.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting was held only so that Putin received his request for an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have won some kind of victory.
For the severe, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after last month’s almost overthrown in a failed coup d’état.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter ban, as, normally, many millions of Russian tourists travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be able to breathe a sigh of relief when air transport can finally continue.
They put their faith in the late autumn rush into the Mediterranean.
And even this week, government television has predicted a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish agricultural products are allowed again.
"Tourned there, the tomatoes back here," was formulated in Vedemost's article.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it feels that the West has a subdued reaction to the attempted coup d'état.
Not to mention the old resentment over Turkey's negotiations on EU membership and Putin's intervention, which is keen to take advantage of cool relations and to break Turkey's ties with the West.
There is no doubt that the Russian leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the attempted coup d'état.
This was self-evident for Moscow, which has its own concern about the change of power.
Russia and Turkey were therefore able to convey an image described by an analyst as an 'union of outsiders' by their high-level meeting at the seaside palace: two countries that feel rejected and abused by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major disagreements.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents reported at a press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek consensus in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a total disaster caused by Turkey, a member of NATO, when shooting down a Russian combat machine, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are again on speaking terms.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the Bank’s global objectives.
The bank had to back down when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to let in more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be abbreviated by RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS turns into an investment brand and because our staff is employed because we are now becoming a bank of many different brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our ambitions are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby and has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now is the time to become a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's President.
"It would have been very sarcastic three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But our work and focus on our customers’ needs rather than our own have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode the Predilection to win the New Market and won his 3,000th prize.
Dettori sprays champagne twice in a row in New Market, which meant 3,000.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th victory in the British championship in New Market on Friday.
This is the milestone he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to victory on the same night on the track of his own place. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey that reaches this milestone in the race running on a flat track.
He's the same one that's been reached before by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey dettori, who previously won in Ghayar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in New Market because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The event is not a big one, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel so humble."
Dettori takes cheers with Predilection after winning
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race, and they are master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, 9 times Derby winner, 4 493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is not surprising that it was he who reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical prowess is what separates him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and his qualifiers have brought fans to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie in Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have won 6,000 races if he didn't only compete on weekends and only in big games!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career in the British Games has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori breathed his accomplishment in a distinctive way by flying off his horse.
Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades.
There's room for ups and downs.
He has won a number of big games, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived a plane crash and has been banned from competition because of the misuse of medicines.
When the non-compete ended three years ago, he had trouble getting started, but he showed an admirable temperament, showed his skeptics and returned to his best.
And for a while now, he is not finishing his career – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his race at least until he is 50 years old."
Mr Putin dismissed Mr. Sergei Ivanovi, Head of Administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Mr Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to a report from the Kremlin, President Putin 'decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as Head of the Russian presidential administration', but no grounds for dismissal were given.
Anton Vaino, Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the post.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he headed the President’s protocol department and the government’s office, reports the Russian - language website of the Kremlin.
Persecution thanked Mr Putin for his appointment in these words: "I am grateful for your confidence.
I believe that the most important task for the administration is to support your actions as Head of State, which means that draft laws are being drawn up and monitored as to how the instructions you give will be implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for divorce and recommended persecution as his successor.
Are smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting on Russian television with President Putin, both said that Ivanov would withdraw from the mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations only convince the few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are they the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very sceptical about the official claim that a man who has been praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy.
The Kremlin's website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
Now I have been Presidential Head of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin served as Head of the Security Service of the Federation that replaced the KGB (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President Putin of Russia after the second term, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for the third term.
However, the mission went to another member of Putin’s immediate circle, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister and then returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of the Criminal Minds – FBI Investigators series, got fired after hitting a producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent fight on the set last month in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios produced a series of kicks in their joint press release.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, had made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened," he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, reports in ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been part of the series since its first production season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in his press release on Friday.
"I was hoping to see the show through, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans the show could ever have wished for."
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Beaching of Fishes in the Banffic Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are windfish caught in the land by a hurricane.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision in Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five - cent fish.
Queensferry's overpass is now connected to Fife.
The GBP 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected the north deck and the bridge to the Queensferry overpass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the deck lines, which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wire ropes.
The GBP 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister for Economic Affairs, visited the construction site today and was one of the first to walk from country to bridge.
Brown says: "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Bridge.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in the construction of the bridge, which alone has been used to build this section of the bridge with more than 30 000 concretes and steel.
Despite the massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge section between the bridge and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
Almost 79% of the whole bridge deck is now in place, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete cover casting in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the peak in the road and civil engineering sector.
After the last section of the road deck was installed and connected to the North Tower road cover, we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. ground) gap.
This was done by pulling the 700 millimeters southwards of the bridge on the north side.
This was a massive operation with great precision at the same time.
Massive, because the bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6 000 tonnes and had to be pulled up at an angle of about 3 %.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small — only a few millimeters.
I'm glad everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells of the miraculous rescue of three men.
Three men caught in a fishing boat off Anglesey were miraculously rescued.
Moelfre RNLI's rescue station made an alarm on Friday at 1.20 local time after its crew discovered an accident in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless course without a director.
"We saw the boat go right by them and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, fortunately, the strong winds had carried the boat away from them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third, 60 years old, was found weary, clinging to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up on a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who have fallen on water are still alive and in perfect condition.
There was an emergency fire cord on the boat’s engine, but for some reason it was separated from the man who was driving the boat at the time of the crash.
They were really lucky on their way."
The Pokémon Go Hunt brings health and happiness
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally it took only television to watch the screen, then video games and, most recently, smartphones came.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which also included a series of drawings, playing cards and other accompanying products).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also fell short before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Descending in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days the number of users of Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In brief, players go out looking for pokémons on their smartphones, which are monitored by GPS. When pokémon is found, it can be "photos" (with the phone's screenshot) or "capping".
The wild has dragged along a generation younger than the video game and lifted the butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps taken by the "average person" in a day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Cardiogram app of Apple Watch which, within two days of the launch of the game, discovered that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know which of the users plays Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have echoed to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to develop cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health-supporting things — exercise, fresh air, and the sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon includes disapproving ridiculers.
And, yes, someone can walk towards the door when they play.
What about it?
Breakthrough is done.
Because even though smartphone applications such as Fitbit could already follow your activity earlier, they did not give any reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty disappears, and the use will be reduced in time.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, there will be more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity and improve their fitness and health of people going on the hunt.

Simone Biles picked up gold in a multiplicity of women's rack gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
It's not a problem at the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
It's great in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old scaffolding gymnast won a multiplicity championship on Thursday and grew the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than the silver-mounted "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the booms in the finals of the women’s arena gymnastics competition at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth in a row and the fifth American woman of all time who won the title of the multiplicity, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all.
Biles burst into tears when his final score came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and raises him to the same class as other sports superstars such as Michael Phelps:
He has won 15 world championship medals, ten of them gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest scaffolding gymnast ever."
There was still one final race in Brazil between Bales and himself and the burden of excessive expectations, not so much between Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be disappointed.

Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point for the farewell party of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought of anything in advance when he was at the top for a long time, that is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes his winning volt series, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The adoption of his grandparents and the discovery of Coach Aimee Boorman’s mother has become a force figure. Borman found the girl when she was on a daycare trip in the gymnastics hall where he trained.
He has not lost a single multi-match competition since summer 2013, and the winning streak is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina was able to take a small lead with two threads, it was like a mirage.
There was a boom and a perm, where Biles is the champion of the world.
He got back in the lead after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the result with 15.933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him while they were waiting for final points — a mere formality — and tears began to appear around Bales’ red, white, and blue crimson color when his dream of writing his scrapbook came true.
Raisman’s performance was a small rematch for a race four years ago when he first divided the third place but then lost the bronze to Mustafina in a re-round.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call the team's "mother" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent kisses to the audience after his permanto program and thus became a winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Party is concerned, this 19-year-old tweet made earlier in the week and widely distributed now has a completely new meaning:
Police report three people listening to music in the car as victims of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating massacre in Phoenix in ten years. Victims sat in the car and listened to music when they were shot, reports a police report published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, a car parked on the street was shot at Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis’ daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, from which he fired eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, says the press release.
The police suspect that the triple homicide was not the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of the second adult victim.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says that the police are now investigating whether the murder is related to four previous attacks.
Seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in Latin - American populated areas within four months.
"It is common for events to happen in residential areas outside homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of the TV and radio company CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the late 1990s brown Nissan, the late 1990s black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that the three had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a press release on the shooting of an empty pickup truck just half an hour before the triple homicide, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Investigators found shell casings and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "It's getting better."
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephalism, or congenital smallheadedness, due to the genetic disorder of his mother Elizabeth Picciuto, whom she was unaware of when pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't get away with this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them and may not live at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing a child in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think there would be any more such practice," says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
Edmund sat up and didn't start crawling until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly progressing at his own pace.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's idea of a sign that means "sing for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean ordinary sign language, but also the signs made up by Edmund himself.
Microcephaly may be caused by several different diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund’s case, or viral infections during pregnancy such as measles or zikavirus.
There's a lot of variation in the symptoms and the prognosis.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of those affected by the zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm of an uncertain future.
"I kept on taking care of what would happen to us,
"What will happen to us?"
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hope - giving counsel for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
"It's getting better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods caused major rescue operations in the state of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, and more rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South-West Mississippi flooded their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of heavy rains.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, reports that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the National Security and Emergency Response Board, reports that the agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steele, Tangipaho County alone has requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in the majority of South Louisiana.
According to the weather service bulletin, there may be an additional 76-127 mm of water coming into the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood warning was issued on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
During the weekend, near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana are predicted to reach record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that flooding downstream in Ascension County poses a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas.
On Friday, at 9 a.m., the Tickfaw River, which flows just south of the Mississippi State border, was already higher than ever.
The rescue work continued in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those saved near Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose quickly during the night.
He had been warned by another stepson who lived nearby.
"We got up, and the water came with a constant feed," Hansford says.
"It reached to my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can swim.
The rescue workers had rescued all three of them into a large military - style truck and taken them to the fire station in Gloster, where they kept shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading as heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information received from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was heavily wet after the rains that started on Wednesday.
Authorities report that due to heavy rains and the flooding of the streets, the inhabitants of Tangipah County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had informed WWL, a subsidiary of the TV and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both of them.
Robby Miller, head of the county, reports that the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped by the flood.
For those evacuated, shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They get to go back to their homes when the water starts to draw back," he says.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipaho County, nearly twenty streets were closed because of the flood, and the inhabitants were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and premises.
"For the first time we had a major flood in March", says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
"This flood seems like it."
In Mississippi, the rains continued steadily along the Gulf of Mexico, reports Rupert Lacy, County Rescue Director of Harrison County.
Lacy says that on Thursday there was a report of a handful of houses flooded, but so far nothing had come to light on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store, says that he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
A six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who's got multiple bullets in his body, survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say there's been a shooting in Philadelphia of a 6-year-old boy who's already the second six-year-old who's been shot in the city this week.
The kid's grandparents told me the kid was Mahaj Brown on CBS Philadelphia.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has had several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that they think he's gonna make it.
He was about to start his first class at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men may have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The scene was filled with assault weapon-like shell casings from various types of assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been a number of armed fighters and they have been actively involved in the shooting," Philly police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old who was shot in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by a stray bullet while playing outside her home on Tuesday in the West Oak Lane district.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
This is what I call the Olympic team for women's gymnastics, and there are more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, this team’s three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female stand gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America was cheering.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the threefold world champion Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, and the surprising and masterly scaffolding programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in the multiplicity of women’s competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman, in turn, won silver.
Such views are at the top of the species, but it does not look the same in scaffolding gymnastics classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), since the next Olympic team for stage gymnastics will have only four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
However, the reality is that scaffolding is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnasiums run by their parents. Parents are paid for training costs, facilities, travels, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members) etc.
Most of the scaffolding gymnastics facilities are located in wealthy residential areas that are able to support the activities.
The training of scaffolding gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Both Simone Party coach Aimee Boomman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have trained the sports enthusiasts since they started scaffolding.
We need to provide more affordable and accessible scaffolding lessons for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm has been aroused by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own scaffolding gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organisations have offered free or affordable opportunities for scaffolding for more than 15 000 urban youths (mostly black and Latin Americans) and some of these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown Detroit so that we can provide high-quality scaffolding for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Box gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits throughout life and supports good health and success at school and in working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start the gymnastics, and it is absolutely amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many young girls of different backgrounds to start their way into prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute on wage and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37 000 junior doctors who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, the Minister of Health, Mr Hunt, announced plans to force an agreement and said that the British public health system (NHS) was 'no one's land' and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that will include changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in antisocial times.
The chairman of the BMA Committee of Junior Doctors, Ellen McCourt, issued a statement last night saying: "The Junior Doctors are still very reserved for the proposed agreement, and there is a particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we have to move on, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even reacting in no way to attempts at discussion.
I did, despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors will be prepared to take further action in the field of industrial battle."
At the end of April, the previous strike postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consultants were asked to support strike doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with the British trade union staff representing doctors.
Trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS employees, appealed to junior doctors not to go on new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Labour struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already operating at the extremes and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, nursing staff and their families.
Over the last two months, we have had discussions with the Junior Medical Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of irregularities.
Workers were hopeful that a continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of the seriousness of the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and May between employees, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health.
A medicine that pays about €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about to receive a daily dose of about €2.40 of the medicine as recommended by the authorities for more people and longer-term use.
Anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is currently given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NHS) has instructed patients to receive ticagrelor for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.
But now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NHS) has instructed patients to receive ticagrelor for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even further.
In England, about 140 000 people are having a heart attack each year, of which a quarter are having a relapse or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fat that accumulates in the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can give birth to a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot falls off, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent the flow of blood into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new attack is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
The ticagrelor manufactured by AstraZeneca in Britain, sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that ticagrelor should be administered at a dose of 90 mg for the next 12 months, followed by a dose reduction of 60 mg and a twice daily dose of aspirin for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the NICE Center for the Implementation of Treatment Procedures says: “Although effective treatment methods for disease progression and effective prevention of symptoms are available, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
We have evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation on the temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in the risk of bleeding, are limited if it is used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Because of the climate of political correctness, electoral fraud flourished in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government
An atmosphere that fostered political correctness led to the closing of eyes to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, reveals a government report published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of Government, severely criticised the police, election observers and city councils for turning their eyes to electoral fraud 'cause of the hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion'.
According to Pickles, a former Minister of State and a current anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form guard chains outside the polling stations in order to protect the frightened voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to the vote.
At the moment, the voter should only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that fingers be dipped in unmistakable ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be given to whistleblowers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for better access for journalists to Government documents and decisions by informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the culture that favours them more widely in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in East London at Tower Hamlet.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court ordered that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, be removed from office because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court held that Rahman ‘wrongly’ the religious feeling of his Muslim community and suppressed his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamicism.
Rahman was said to "use the religious duty of every religious Muslim to vote for him as a basis for his campaign".
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently cast in the way that the person voted by pretending to be some other person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the fraudulent postal election, in which members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of suggestions to clean up the voting system, including the requirement of identity cards at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the wishes of older members, particularly in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"We were concerned that... the government institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of "politically correct" ethnic and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on the processing of postal ballots by political activists, in order to prevent the 'harvesting of votes' from happening.
The report currently under consideration by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Baptism of fingers after voting in indelible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of the voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic postal voting.
Refusal of political activists to handle filled votes sent by post and mail-sound envelopes.
The right of the police to set up watch chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person is allowed to enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and considers it "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Electoral Court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on several grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient 'cross-checking' of the electoral lists of the city council.
"The decision given by the Court last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and disguised electoral fraud committed by some people and its denial."
The likeness of an Olympic biker with the Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers fad at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild with a French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a similarity with a well-known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives, whose resemblance with Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) of the US men's archery team has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the Duchess Catherine’s doppelganger seen on cycling tracks, many people have quoted in social media how a archer could be the actor’s favorite double brother Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. men’s archery team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures of him, which startledly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that he had heard since he was a child that he resembles DiCaprio.
"I don't see the resemblance that big, maybe apart from the beard and the mustache," said Brady Huffington to Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In the 2012 London Games, a British tall jumper, Greg Rutherford, and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, were struck by the resemblance, which is undoubtedly even more evident in these games.
Alya Mustafina, the great and expressive Russian gymnast, has been called the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
On the other hand, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, who is known for the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of an actor in Inception.
Similarly, for a long time, the resemblance between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has been quoted, highlighted by both strong eyebrows and lips.
Uinn silver medalist, the Russian Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalynne McCord, and not just because of her beautifully tanned skin and blond hair, whereas the United States team Nathan Adrian is, according to his fans, an "atletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter’s actor Jennifer Carpenter (right), resemble each other’s face shapes and eyes.
Not only: This Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the resemblance.
This user wonders if a couple’s resemblance is a good reason.
A tweeter recently expressed his satisfaction when "other people on the Internet agree on the resemblance between Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the actor in the Dexter series are truly startlingly reminiscent of each other's face shapes and eyes.
Many have also found similarity in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and the gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna! in the broad smiles of Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic Commentator apologizes for saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s, in a women’s 4 x 200-metre freestyle message, shocked CBC’s direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian Broadcasting Company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "smelled" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started to sound his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-metre free-driving finale.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC reporting team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
He was too excited, he left fast, and he died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and stayed 1,61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig??"
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhan, who was swimming in the finale of the women's 4 x 200-metre freestyle message, was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg of yours, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with ferocious Byron MacDonald critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters didn't hold back when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
"Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist group. #responsible."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted what MacDonald said: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
The CBC finally had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
My fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to express his condolences on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regrets to more than 90 other tweeters who complained about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We sincerely regret these statements and the fact that they were on the air.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his regret on the air and tried to justify his speech by saying that he did not mean it personally.
"I want to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's swim," said MacDonald at the CBC Olympics.
"I referred to the performance of a swimmer, not a person.
Needless to say, I did not mean anything demeaning by my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, the woman who made up her underwear in the middle of the shop shocked customers.
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman undress in the middle of Primark to try on her underwear.
He further worsened the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to go around and finally tried four pairs of underpants at a store in Folkestone, Bouverie Place.
The Primark chain store at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping mall, where she tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children who was in the store at the same time, says that after experimenting with underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People could not believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underpants and put them on.
He did not try to do it inconspicuously, but did it with complete shame.
Everyone was staring when he took off the underwear he tried, and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn’t like anything, dressed up and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks — and he didn’t think about the person who eventually bought the underwear he had tried.”
Davidson, 33 years old in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has worn and has not washed."
The case happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the shop staff tried to remove the items of clothing from the sale after the woman had left – which is right.
It would be terrible to take home new underwear and find that someone else has tried them without having washed them since then," adds Davidson.
Mr Primark's spokesperson commented on this by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market."
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack with Krav Maga.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, the great champion of the Krav Maga Federation, in New York, and asked for advice on how to cope with a mugger or abuser waving a gun at close range.
The video will show you how to defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
Then take the weapon so that it falls between your elbows and upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee into the groin, and when he goes twice the pain, slap him in the face with the barrel of a gun and back off by keeping the gun pointed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches the front. You must move away from the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot launch.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and hit the attacker with a fist in the chest. Turn the gun away from the attacker’s grip, back off and keep the gun focused on the attacker.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video. See how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, though, that the safest way to get rid of the robber is to hand over your cash — unless you are the great Krav Maga champion.
Ian Wright, who makes the tour guide, licks the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and cacoding reflex to a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk’s host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance to strength by licking euro banknotes, handrails at Piccadilly Circus, train toilet flush button and Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a luminometre to see for himself and show the viewers what he was pushing his tongue into.
The experiment was made a documentary film Ian Wright – after internal power, and its results were surprising.
The idea of licking the toilet button on the train may be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright is interviewing doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening the good bacteria in the intestines and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, where he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
There is no doubt that licking the rail rail rails and toilet flush button challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says in a documentary: "I've been quite careless about my health since I was a child and put into my mouth a lot of things, such as dirt, worms and muddy water."
In the film, he really proved himself to be worthy of his reputation.
Raja met only in a filthy public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4000 units from the sample.
By comparison, the number of newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border met in the Russian public bathroom, where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units — in newly washed hands the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures with Valio in a documentary film Ian Wright – On the trail of internal power, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4,000 units, nothing's dirtier than that!
This place is so disgusting, I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film Ian Wright – In cooperation with Valio.
From Valio Wright was given a Valio Gephilus containing lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the category manager for Valio's snack, juice and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer our consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and we finally came to the idea of asking Ia to join us."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the intestine has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: "It is said that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian bathroom, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some targets was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty licks on the tape."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58% reported that they used at least occasionally products to which lactic acid bacteria have been added.
Before their eviction, the harassment family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltashi, Cornwall.
The harassment family left behind the damage of £50,000 in the town-owned rental house after they had been evicted for terror in the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltashi, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forced out of the apartment, the representatives of the rental housing company were shocked to find that the apartment was in repair condition.
There were gaping openings on the walls, floorboards were torn off, trash was spread on floors, and walls were stained with graffiti.
The couple have now moved, and they are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh, for the property is likely to become known as not such a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, as is its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time. According to the police, the family’s tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug use and care, and loud shouting, fighting and swearing.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the tenancy agreement, received a decree on antisocial behaviour.
In several rooms of the house under the threat of demolition, old garbage was found.
In the past, drugs had been sold out of the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
According to neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency evicted the couple by coercion this week after giving them 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction — they said that their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and the whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here so many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the wild walls of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's behaviour, since eviction is always the last measure that the Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This incident was very difficult, for the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community who took part in the work and courageously offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already in their 20s.

Housing workers now have to clean out the waste heaps around the house.
In 2014, the police raided the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies and 1 700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined for having been found guilty of possession of class B drugs with a view to selling it.
He claimed that the money was for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard of moving to a private home in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were smudged with graffiti.
The police say they're demanding eviction for tenants who break the lease rules.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police say that this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who continue to defy the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they wish without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," Crow says.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
A low - flying, beached army jet scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion crashed to a staggering height.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that didn't threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were panicking when a low - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes near touch from the sun - taking tourists on the sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose to their feet as they were understandingly concerned about the thunder of the engines of the jet engine, which began to be heard before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the photographers of the dramatic fly-by and the videos of the holidaymakers published on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice as low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane was gonna crash on me."
Tourists on the beach at Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a staggeringly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight intended to identify the coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke caused by nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the air force said that this did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused damage in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that due to the poor visibility of the heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The plane was on a training flight that asked the pilot to identify the fishing vessels.
Results for the first half of the year better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where institutional care has been dismantled by developing preventive services.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the exote is trying to shorten the queues of measures.
Exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Executive Board will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special linemen took a military oath at Immola.
The 70 garrisons of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
A military oath was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special class of Rangers was held at the garrison’s sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 garrisonmen.
Special border rangers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special borderer.
Two hundred and fifty were invited to the exams.
Special border icers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime border forces were involved in the meeting in connection with the ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A little bit ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operating the RTA, a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme police department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is a lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers in the turbulent.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would rarely leave the place of the swamps until they received the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target day-to-day police activity where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were set up in the country.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Crime Police, manages operations on a national basis.
PTR units work according to their name from the police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police services and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your area
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm function database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminal offences or similar crimes.
This is called seriesing, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the unsub is made up of a certain image.
Serials can be done on the basis of either the method of action or the person, depending on who the police have more information about.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of the methods of both own and criminal use, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent criminal attempts by the police.
The police will tell the public about the methods if it anticipates that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, news in early summer, the method used in housebreakings to mark empty dwellings.
In it the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
Pre-trial investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning from the mistakes they have made.
The clever ones order the district court minutes, which may show, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppä from the Häme police department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland police department, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu police station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and financing levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl from London who joined fathers was killed in Syria
News reports that one of the three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
A lawyer named Tasname Akunjee tells that the girl’s family heard Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian air strike on Raqqa, the ISIS base in Syria, reported the ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she was planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will so that people will understand that this is a real risk when entering the war zone - and that will cause people to give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, together with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an Isis fighter in Syria and had been widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he's elected.
The Senate's Democratic Director, Harry Reid, says he is convinced that the Democratic President-designate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Merrick Garland as Supreme Court Judge if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have refused to confirm Garland's appointment since he was appointed by Barack Obama in March.
According to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the next president will elect a person to fill the post of late Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a conference call on Thursday, Reid said that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland with a "quite high degree of certainty".
Reid’s spokesperson later stated that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "crush the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District Court of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans who are blocking Garland's appointment are the "commanders" and "advisors" of President Donald Trump.
According to him, Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to both women and men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market a calendar made in the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of the celebrity naked models, they want to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, told me earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from the old school Playboys, because he says: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he feels the same way about the calendar.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, as well as men, can enjoy and be inspired by these pictures that praise the female body," says Shaw in a press release on the calendar.
"I'm sure women want to participate in this project because it's going to be a beautiful piece of art."
Those who wish to use the calendar can send their photos online or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write in the comment section under the name of your angry objection NoAllLonelyMen of Middle Ages, this claim is based on actual research data.
According to youGov, there is no Millenial generation boom behind the much-talked new arrival of vinyl plates, when the millenians want to know the physical object in their hands, but instead there is a middle-life nostalgia behind it.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
Also, it is not just a hobbyist’s desire to pick up records; it is an emotional issue: older vinyl disc buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I was walking along lively Soho Street, wearing an unruly gray jacket. I would get my hands out of the way, bend my hands into a cup, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and roughness when hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over premises before private entrepreneurs, there are still a handful of special record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I get very close to the men visiting these stores and try to evaluate their age and character.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (at that moment by two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (at that moment by eight middle-aged men, one probably in his 20s) is on a meeting trip to London for an afternoon and spends extra time exploring the supply of shops.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I've got about 3,000 to 4,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired so many albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared and buy again things that he had been selling when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of late '60s and early '70s stuff that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25 at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their clients fit the profile of YouGov.
However, he has discovered a new stream of people affected by media leaps. These people have heard of vinyl discs coming again and now feel compelled to buy back their old records.
"On the basis of the discussions I had held, people had usually given up their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This could explain the boom of vinyl awakenings of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they offer a comforting community to like - minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may confuse some vinyl fans, to whom returning to familiar disk cases means stability and reminds us of the lucky days of youth.
"I think that it sometimes fills a gap or material possessions are acquired for some comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe so many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off things."
"We're like social workers!" says Wez's co-worker from behind the record pile.
A April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought vinyl albums in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also reported that 41 per cent have a record player that they never use and 7 per cent of those who buy vinyl discs do not have a record player of their own.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably show a serious face while looking at a stack of bossa nova collections.
The new appearance of vinyl discs is also accompanied by the "potal phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, the seller of Sounds of the Universe (at that moment three middle-aged men).
"A client recently came into the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy Radiohead so he can put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not large, but they are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell us they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is considerably more varied in the Fop, which I come to next. The store has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl plates.
The customers are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is a delight, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of rocking jazz from speakers, Wild Beasts’ latest sex-prone synthesizer pop.
None of the customers look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various albums on sale.
He's more of a watcher than a shopping man.
He says his income is low, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot of money.
Music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the wine is...", he lets out a fond sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping jeans, but they're gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and a daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a staircase with a wall filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac albums: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, key albums for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just an interior element and part so high that they can't even reach them.
They're pure "art vinyl" interiors.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send some customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population most likely to have more time and money than most is also the group that spends most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although the results of my research are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which actually exist both in record stores and in online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
I'm sure they won't be spending their Thursday morning snooping around the Berwick Street record stores, browsing records and avoiding a 30-year-old TV host who stares in fear and stares at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate – video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest ice shark was 272 to 512 years in the study, a female of five metres in length.
The French court rejected an application for the dismantling of jungle camp shops
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities calling for dozens of temporary shops and restaurants to be dismantled in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities made claims that the state should be allowed to dismantle the 72 temporary trades established in the refugee camp, which sell different items from tobacco to energy drinks and offer hair clippings.
According to Calais Prefects, these shops and restaurants must be dismantled because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the shadow economy and because they pose fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid teams told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, since free meals provided by a government-supported organization and others are not enough for the increasing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of the Calais Prefect 'fully understandable'.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply offering food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids cafe in the camp, which is not for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice for hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the camp, whose position is the most vulnerable.
Over 170 000 people have signed a petition requiring children's café to be maintained.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closure would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old".
On Friday, two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that since the sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record number of more than 9,000.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food in Finland is falling sharply to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, it fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become more expensive than 1%.
In the last three years, the price of food has fallen in Finland to the second highest in those EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
In the United Kingdom alone, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
These data derive from the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Development of Statistics Finland, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage of EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, after which the food has become cheaper each year.
The price is now being weighed down by the Russian import bans on food, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has appeared in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same level of pay.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutchmen would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT must be halved to the EU average and the price competition will continue," says Lehtinen.
The newspaper points out that his calculations at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School isn't exactly the same anymore.
A person returning to the school bench may find that a change has taken place in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned and, instead, the practice of coding begins in schools.
Swedish education will begin in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies will start already in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live after that for another 250 years, reporting a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed by only by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507.
Greenland sharks are swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch longer than dogs, can grow up to more than five meters [5 m] long.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimeter a year is followed, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined adult ice sharks from the age of 28 females caught in fishermen’s traps.
The age of the fish was revealed in the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cents Amazonine fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that the glacial females only reach maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people - no less sellers.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operative companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be carried out as redundancies", Stockmann explains in his press release.
It states that the number of suppliers in the department stores will not be reduced in order to avoid the loss of customer service.
In addition, around 80 support workers are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the time of their start, the reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining a profit from the department store are in the background.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the trade in department stores is still losing.
According to the acting CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in department stores have not met the company’s objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018, says Veijalainen in the press release.
The result improvement of the second quarter was based in particular on the success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter net sales and results of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north... temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, meteorologist at HS.
There are showers also in the central parts of the earth, but there is a crouton southward.
The temperature is no longer very summer, since the whole country is below 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20 ° C].
In the rainy areas of the north, they remain at 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya’s athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal — a strange explanation for the coach’s stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah was an athlete for the national team in a doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star, Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, head of Kenya’s national team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after giving a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officers went to the Anzrah authorities to report it.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour", the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, Mr Kip Miele, thundered on the news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Last year, Rotich was fourth in the World Cup and is one of Rio's favourite winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid they'd find out," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s Athletic Stadium Is Treading Out of emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday in Rio, the battle for athletic medals began, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a bafflingly empty audience.
On Friday, Rio organizers reported that only 58 percent of the first - day tickets and 65 percent of the tickets have been sold.
There was another four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheering crowds.
The final tickets are already sold out in Rio.
Even before athletics, Rio’s Olympic spectator loss has attracted attention.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medalistic hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the audience of 12 000 were still full.
The bad news is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian competition tourist, and many Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
During the weekend Mario Andrada, spokesperson for the race organizers, reported that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, because the organisers need money and try to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known species such as golf and rugby for schoolchildren in the country.
Rio Stadium had a lot of empty seats this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba's sand hasn't interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There was a lot of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
Thereafter, private, business and entities can cash in the holder rights to the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is distributed virtually into blocks that can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right to the right to claim the right to the right to a payment.
The holder is entitled to veto a parcel of 187 square metres, which in practice means that not every holder is required to be approved if the use of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
The acquisition of the right to rule is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself to something to protect nature," explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
A person who acquires the right to administration receives precise location information from his or her block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
Names of holders who have acquired rights on the Foundation's website are displayed on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Leviakangas sees only the risk of the Foundation’s activities changing from its original idea.
Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land by buying or donating land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turkey most of the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turkey most of the large cities of Finland.
This year more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police the number of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year and their parts per 1000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, twice the number of thefts is made in proportion to the number of residents," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector of the Police Department.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by the amount of bikes in the city and how many wheels there are," says Sergeant Teemu Mäkäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city where city centres are remote from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility," says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report little more than 20 000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're in large quantities," says Reen.
In fact, thieves take more bikes, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bicycle theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police find out.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in the blood.
"Even in other investigations, cases can also be identified when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with the police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from shopping center bike racks, indoor yards, warehouses and bike cellars, in practice wherever they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopo are the most important ones stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the wheel for short - term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen wheels end up on the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least it has not become known to the police that stolen wheels would go abroad a lot," says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of concealment or violation.
"The alarm clocks should ring if the bike is sold in good condition at a clear price," says Reen.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, carries his colorful fasts to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Moose says. "No one's ever been taken, so there's been a good monk."
"Perhaps this does not attract thieves, it may not even have hipster value," says Helsinginen Moose.
Siiri Valve, who was in the Helsinki Kallio kiosk, quickly locked his bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike swung against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, such as a wheel rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have," says Helsinki student about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that you've been taking your bikes."
"Most of the bad bikes, those booger Jopos."
One year ago, a bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of the building company from the wake itself.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve was expecting it to be taken.
You're under the age of 15 to be held responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurys familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from being caught in a spiral of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under 15 years of age who are now deprived of criminal liability.
A peer jury is involved in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can himself join the peer jury to make up for what he did.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of mediation that are used side by side.
"In all cases, the actions of a young person are directed in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined from the first mistake," Laitio says.
Peer jurorship has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflexes what happened with his or her peers.
We've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The Peer Jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Ms Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all young people who need them, not just those who need them.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress rather than Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring the democrats a landslide in these elections," says Politico.
Only by directing all possible funds to the Congressional elections can the Republicans be prevented from drowning with a Trump-enriched anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is prominently opposed to Trump by Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not a question of supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton outlined the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I'm running for president to make the American economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, 275 billion-dollar five-year programme to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-out for the American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in high-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the builders' people, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders anyway when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the tax of departure," Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to a free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he used to support.
"[As President] I am opposed to any trade agreements that are against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial programme announced by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for “only favoring millionaires of this kind”.
Mr Trump's proposed discount on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton pricked.
These are Rio’s ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Sports games are usually seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a great number of spectators.
At one time, the competitions have glued to the screens at best 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 spectators from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Championships for athletics from one month ago attracted almost 800 000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Championships for football amounted to well over one million.
For the time being, the most interested in Olympic sports has been cycling on Sunday evening and the fifth day of the competition opened up stage gymnastics, both of which reached almost half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Yle Sport, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that the spectators are divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of TV viewers choose the Olympic Games at all.
Even on the television side, the viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competition for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers continue to be from 20,000 to 500 000, that is a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - much of Rio’s race shows come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a weak interest - if someone now thinks it is weak - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are only just beginning, as are other sports of Finnish interest: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the ratings at the beginning have been close to what was expected.
When athletics start, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which became the most downloadable free app in Finland during the first days of the games in Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150 000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get network ratings until later." Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not been operating on all users as hoped.
Mr Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
An updated version of the apps has been obtained that should correct the errors.
Rio Olympic Games are visible on Yle’s channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some species from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Speech transmits games every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the back of the cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical dive instructor, found a 20-square-metre impression on the back of the cross, the bottom of which looked 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by collecting echoes.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 meters," says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So for the time being, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be some unknown depths," Kannela says.
If the deepest lake is defined by the middle depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Viewed this way Päijänne does not reach the ten deepest groups and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction on August 12th at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong.
I admire the tax rate: Pensioners' taxation is still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still stricter than that of employees.
An Ihalainen says that the problem was raised in the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
This is not what the government's proposal contains.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the elections," he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
It heated up in the parliament the opposition representatives, who grilled Alexander Stubb, then finance minister, about election promises.
Buying power is secured. It won't grow.
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (C.E.), tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power rather than increasing, as next year wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (central) and Orpo's willingness to respect the hard-earned competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be destroyed by questioning them.
This will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Addressing prolonged unemployment in a row
An Ihalan appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to halt its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombings of Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists going to Thailand to cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution are worth following," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travelling season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to Finns in Hua Hin for information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No record of the author.
Westphalen says there's no record of who did the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of the divided Thai society and last week's referendum on the military junta's constitution.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country who declared their opposition to the law were arrested.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population arises, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
According to him, the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks should affect the day's course in such a way that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours, when 11 bombs have exploded in various parts of the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, popular with tourists.
Even in a tourist destination popular by Finns, the holiday island Phuket had four bombs detonated at night, reports Bangkok Post, a Thai newspaper.
According to current data, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have been detonated in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb was detonated in the village of Surat Than and Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Unknown attacker
According to the leader of the military junta in Thailand, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not foment people to panic any further," he said to journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trangi are linked.
He said to Thai BSB that the aim of the perpetrators was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions on caution, Westphalen says.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known so far about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has given us a little more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of a clock tower known as a sight.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, the Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The Chief of Police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in Surat Than’s attack, which exploded every 30 minutes or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won the women's quadruple
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was the second with 60,098 points and the third with 58,665 points as Alija Mustafina of Russia.
Biles, 18, is still in the Rio Games for stage championships at permanence, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the full in recent years.
He's got eight personal world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanence championships three times in a row as well as the boom in the past and the year before.
In the US team, Partys has won two World Championships.
The party's got a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate office in Phuket Thailand and the children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the attacks on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think there will be anything more amazing, Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these former ones have not banished tourists, this is hardly the case either.
The office of Huovila company is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around 9:00 local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on because of the queen's birthday," Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach haven't even heard of the attacks.
At half past half past three days in Thailand time at Patong the traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who was at the scene of the attack.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men matching the description hidden in a nearby spruce tree.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One ran away, but later a man was found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft of the use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
The police are grateful to those who tipped us off.
Research Director of Russia's leadership changes: Clear removal
On Friday, Russia made the highest-ranking change in its leadership in years when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-based 44-year-old Anton Persecution.
He's an ex-diplomat. He's a second-in-command of Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanov was disfellowshipped may be that Putin wanted to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling executives is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up independent authority for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in conflict with other leaders or has screwed up.
Drop-off to Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, is taking on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
Mr Putin, on a tape presented by the national media, said that the amendment was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to another position and suggested that the persecution be replaced, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union at the KGB.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin will change his immediate circle to younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city.
Corrected prior news at 7:30: Earlier, we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal," says Professor Tomi Vouti from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
Previously, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants in the Home Secretary's events to the Evening Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information had been recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communication of the Ministry says to the STT that the need to reform practices has been recognised in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio.
Like in the last few years, Bolt has run against time under a high-ranking race.
In the early years, he insulted his backline and had to skip the Olympic trials in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - fashioned samba dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of athletics struggling with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut out in the 200-metre primers at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters [100 m] in which he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors despite the final celebration at the time of 9.69.
This is gonna be harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career with a clock.
World record records in Berlin for 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 for two hundred are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a world record of 200 meters and a 19 - second run, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
For a hundred dollars, Bolt’s toughest challenger is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the Valuable Games if he has been on his way.
In Daegu, 2011 the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in a young man's sport, and Rio's races are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Exposures from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in a women's 100-metre butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his case of doping before the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xinyin Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reports that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormones.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach from Rio home because of a drug offence.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, reported that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to the media, this is John Anzrah, a Kenyan express coach.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from Ferguson Rotich, a 800-meter runner.
Phelps will not be stopped - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, in the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio during the 200 - meter season.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same type of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before the Chinese Wang Shuni.
I'm just trying to have some fun, and the BBC Olympic swim commentator, Helen Skelton, is laughing at the quick interview in Evening Magazine.
The article on Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton won't be much stressed out if there's a little noise in social media or in the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress with at least enough exposure to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no further steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton would like to impress you and perhaps startle you, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the noise has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that points to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It is a touch of nothing if it comes from (the host) dressing.
I'm a little bit amused if one of these has hit someone's radar.
Rio PD made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they have arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
The police made the arrests in connection with the security of the Games.
In this connection, the police made five other arrests and interrogated two individuals before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 News site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have ties to the Isis Association.
The arrests were reportedly instigating violence in the social media.
Messages about violence had been distributed in the popular WhatsApp service, among others.
Eighty-five thousand police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hangar on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place down to the public.
The police let the audience in after they had controlled the explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have performed a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The audience got in after the police had controlled the package.
The audience didn't get there by the start of the fight, because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hangar.
The police blew up the package and didn't let the audience in until after.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the games drowsy.
With two defeats, Spain won Nigeria by 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain reached silver.
The police already performed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of the roadbiking site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dame made Petäjä-Siren think about protest
The Wind of the Petter-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The Wind of the Petter-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
Argentinea’s dame made Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," said Joakim Wilenius, Finland’s head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing, because it would have been pointless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get compensation," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
During the accident, the Finnishman was left in 27th place.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympic Silver Medal is the eighth.
The car accident on the head didn't have much effect.
It's a big day on Friday when you have to race for departures from 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, the Petter-Siren did not protest.
7 Special things that science says prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life grows longer.
At other times, things that a person himself cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to average body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can increase your age.
You don't have to spend all your time getting a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been sought through many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a “reduced risk of death”, especially in the case of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is supported by studies that moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental flossing can extend a person’s life by more than six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected man’s life.
The seven-year project was monitored by over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live when the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings additional years, and there is no denying that.
However, reaching longevity does not require absolute solitude.
One Oxford University study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete or an actor who won the Oscars at the Olympic Games, he is more likely to live longer than a regular chubby.
Many research efforts have been made to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that long life is due to the social status of a person - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to seek confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of shopping behaviour among people aged 65 or over found that a person who shops on a daily basis is likely to be older than a person who shops less often.
This is because spinning in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So put your credit card out of your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from Umpa fell into a truck.
On Friday night in Koske in Varsinais-Suomi, a serious truck and passenger car accident occurred.
The accident took place in Koskella, Koskentie and Sorvastontie in the middle of Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted in the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the collision, the truck was left in a lane, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who was carrying a passenger car was crushed in her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and were transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in a felony DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy range was flawed because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was shopping for candy at the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Post gets the load delivered!
So if there was no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The shopkeeper’s foxy sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to mowing.
Weed cutting is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the upgrade just blew me away.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that this has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Elt got her own favorites caught in a candy bag, even though a few tins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to the Evening Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Seenjoki) and we stopped delivering part-time (Saloon) in three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesos told the Evening-Sanos.
The first news item is the Evening Sanomat.
Teija Halt was not indignant at the sign because he found all his own candy favorites in the selection.
Vertigo weight loss! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund published a picture of her change
The comedian producer has lost tens of pounds since his baby was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared a photo pair on Friday when she moved to Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a physical course and aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss work already in 2009.
He has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund published a photo pair on Instagram for his spectacular performance.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Before and after Backlund, a pair of pictures have collected several praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous, though.
We're on the same journey, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project.
Your pictures give me a great deal of strength and enthusiasm, as one of them tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Do It Now" project.
At that time, he told Evening magazine that he wanted to get to the normal weight, which was ten kilos.
During the three months of exercise, five pounds eventually fell.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the good of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered by donating to the police dog work instead of flowers and petitiones.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wishes for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The article says that the victim had worked in Sipoo Veterinarian Centre as a substitute and had also completed her nursing training there.
The Veterinarian Station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and not afraid of work.
A good friend.
Still, we cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donations go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lowisian woman was murdered in her own backyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have told the Evening Magazine that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to retain the salary of an employee who refused to teach a temporary agency worker, Kanta-Häme District Court assessed in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the tutor’s salary, which corresponded to the share of education in all day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee was put at a disadvantage by virtue of his trade union activities in breach of the Equality Act.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision on the non-refoulement of the Union of Posts and Logistics.
During last November’s postal strike, PAU decided that Posti’s employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who broke the strike.
The People's News first told us about it.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writing to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (in the middle) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (p.) in their answer to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Journalist Federation asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration, replacing the Estonian-based Persecution.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the Head of the Presidential Administration, Sergei Ivanov, says the Kremlin.
The farm will be attended by Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vain's grandson Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
Persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council," says Interfax, news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin's press release, Ivanov, who was part of Putin's tight inner circle, is taking up specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to another position and suggested that persecution be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant buy-out - can't be seen in the opening of the League of Champions
You don't see the world record man for football transfers on the field when the English League of Champions is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed England.
Manchester United’s giant acquisition by Paul Pogba is on the sidelines of ManU’s opening league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid the Italian Society Juventus EUR 105 million for Pogba.
However, the British Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Juventus was burdened with a ban.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England. The FA told the BBC.
Pogba’s next seam to play is the league’s second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grand madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
The event area of the Flow Festival is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in the productions of events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations," says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70,000 in the past year by 5,000.
This year there will be a group of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle that is controlled by huge routes.
That's not what we want.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been puffed up so that there are 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in a partly artificial grass-dressed area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, the concert venue this year is a tent of 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our case anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, even great visions are practically possible.
During the early 2000s, the operation was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the public limited liability company running Flow amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creise things", such as the construction of that 73-metre-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap music and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booed because now is probably the last time we see this on a show in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what they play on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a lot of good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs from Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
Two bombs went off in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and over 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wild animals in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish touristist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs were detonated on Phuket Island, which was popular with Finns.
No one was reported to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one dead and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trangi City.
Police reported that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the efforts of the Thai military leadership.
According to estimates by local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently seized on the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new troops will go to battle first in the event of war
In an acute war situation, soldiers are not ordered to battle until several months after taking a military oath, says the Keskisuomalainen.
According to the Chief Education Officer of the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, for example, military personnel serving 5.5 months in the event of war are only capable of fighting those who are in the final stages of their training.
According to the training manager, the first task is to recruit reserve personnel from the emergency teams.
No garrison or reserver is ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been provided, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training military personnel for immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations even during military training.
Pamela Tola's got a huge payoff for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a heavy dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The price of a two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious problem with moisture was discovered in the house, causing a harmful microbial growth for health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in order to be demolished in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both district and court courts.
The court ruled on the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court’s judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of legal proceedings and liquidation of the couple.
The right to moderate the price reduction slightly, as buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors revealed were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola looked for a home in good condition
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do the repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the aspects mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report mentioned the risks and the lack of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not reveal that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the impression that rainwaters from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years it became apparent that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more serious than we thought.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, were due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the ground moisture that rose capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by the microbes was estimated by the inspector to have reached the interior of the porch.
The mold or yeast that makes the health risk possible, above the limit values, was found in brush samples in the home care room, in the basement stairwell, in the windower in the living room and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
There was also a dispute in the court as to whether the dwelling had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to make changes to the dwelling contrary to the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were not yet any appropriate permits.
However, mold problems were central to the court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, purchasers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that there was no particular reason to carry out a wider inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter on how documents are stored in the National Archives of the United States of Maryland for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and licenses originate from the Nazi German Racial Bureau.
The Racial Bureau was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted in women to investigate the situation.
Among other things, the Bureau of Race investigated women’s background by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the Racial Agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from those close to them.
The Racial Bureau wanted to guarantee that women were "child lovers", "saved" and "good national socialists" who knew German very well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a government-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, the website of the Holocaust Museum of the United States reports.
Instead, Nazi demographic politics focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
A German mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
The 6th of Sire the traitor, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was third in sailing at the Rio Olympic Games on the first day of Finnjollie’s day, but remained the top of the whole group at the second.
In the overall situation, the sparrow rose to eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought for RS:X class day departures in places 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained in the 23rd place at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hung over"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the Tango King of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance boards and festivals, Sillanpää is still in a state of ferociousness.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen about the life of his favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of his life and career in good and bad.
Bridgehead’s career rose to a total rise as he won the tango king’s crown in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finland’s music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and just after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung up!
Bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately be guessed that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, it was still a good print.
I learned that all the time you don't have to ask yourself to be perfect and peaked.
Another incident related to one of the most popular pieces of the man’s book occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case ended up in the single text published in 2014.
The book says that the song lyrics ordered from Sarah Törmäsä were not as Bridgenpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined he was making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the breakup song were not true, it was written on the basis of the news in 7 days.
In the newspaper’s news, Jar’s and his ex-lover’s divorce were attributed to Jar’s excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was total nonsense and was not true.
According to the book, he was furious with the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually he ended up singing it, and that's a good thing.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls of the voting week are predicting the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support for staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign by former US President Bill Clinton, 'It's the economy, stupid', flew into a scrap heap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professionals with answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real Brit.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it will promote the export industry.
Economist opinion was that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus among economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were beset by the neutrality of the BBC, which gave as much space to only a couple of per cent of economists in favour of the EU divorce, as by the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hated press was not interested in explaining what the views of IFS, IFM, BOE, CEPR and LSE and other economic fangs are about the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, central government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not feel that they have common interests.
Although academics such as Economists would have stayed in the EU, the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants congest your hospital, immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every coffee shop has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the right British to get a place to go if they were to get rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, provision was made in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the EU divorce camp, began to be better prepared for a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their assets from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We left to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily listing of the real estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
According to old age, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds," says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds fell to or even below 10%.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down trade
When the EU-registration camp won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm,” says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, who estimated that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, Standard Life, the first of the real estate funds, froze its trading.
Together, these looted the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Olden, they did not actually close the deal, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether to withdraw the money in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it's going to be a loss.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled.
Since then it has been quite stable, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen, for example.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Mr Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate funds received an excessive amount of attention.
Open funds affected by closures account for about four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s lockout lasted for six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might stick to its fund for 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been rife downwards, but the situation does not appear to be more "horrible" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of the real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar collector can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit's investments in the London real estate market
At 2:00 in the morning, things didn't look too good.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the property investments in Aberdeen Asset Management in the British Real Estate Fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B," says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed straight for work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally fixed silent in the office sounded the news, and usually the loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell about his breakup.
When the market opened, the screens flashed just red.
It was such a morning that you never thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdee, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. the Midsummer.
The atmosphere was a mess.
However, the company had well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was calm in a way," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went for a change.
The market started to anticipate drastic declines in the UK real estate market, especially in London.
In the coming years, the London office space was expected to be up to 20% negative.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Even Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the tumult has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not show its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on Vanhanen's face.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about Brexit’s consequences.
So much is still open: how does the difference happen and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the subject of initial information.
The CBRE data on price developments of the real estate service company cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minuses amounted to 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The figures aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All similar falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly with Lehman’s collapse and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite accurate, since it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales of that time, but the willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's a lot of funding going on.
The repair movement could have been in front of us anyway.
As a matter of fact, he doesn't find it a miracle that a price-fixing movement could have been in front of him if it wasn't for Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, property prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a really high level.
London's prices have tightened up for four reasons, Vanhanen List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalising," says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which, for example, has forced pension companies to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the debt lever has now been used significantly less than during the pre-2008 boom.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to relax its holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of change in the way we expected, and now it came.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He's afraid to judge the future, but he says there's hardly going to be a rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady road ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks they can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also distributed," says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you eat, because today the trading group said that it is beginning to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
By the time information has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to pick up it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group follows Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used subject to authorisation for marketing purposes.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Quite few customers have banned the use of product information," Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to a change in the registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to simple food purchases.
The classification is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer program and it is not planned for the moment.
Finland's Near Finland has its own onesbonus customer loyalty program, which can be associated with the selection houses, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting product or product group-level data, we remain at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group," says Anu Ora, Trade Director.
According to him, the customer loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but the local store will tell you about it later.
However, the Ora does not consent to the registration of product information.
Start with the experiment
SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information includes occupation, education, form of residence, years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded from the S-Front card purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
By contrast, data are recorded at the product group level for the time being in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Activities at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the bags, whether they like it or not.
A willing person can check his or her data stored on the S Group's website.
For example, the cashiers are unable to access the data, stresses Saarirki.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever’s puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing with his favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of powder - gas grappling shells appeared.
The powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, the owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for online commerce
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the exploration of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports.
However, the airport will be the main workplace in Heila, as the international security situation has changed as a result of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action at Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector at Customs.
The second main reason for the training of the gun and explosives dog in Customs' tasks is postal mail via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, as many as 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including military equipment and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to arms, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials from online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether further weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Finnish School of Dogs in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to the police and defence experts with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila will always be further trained as needed," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of the Evening Messages loses the mic shield of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cap immediately from the "loose" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial education will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is adequate for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog on a work vest, like Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active hours only last from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owner of working dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner applied for about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Customs.
The mini-state got their first Olympic medal - the people get the day off
Fiji’s Olympic gold of less than a million inhabitants in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the National Broadcasting Company, the Fijian Government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team's return home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital city of Suva, where a screen was erected in the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought together our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering, said Maikele Seru Guardian, editor of the Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos of thrust and 145 kilos of rapture.
He's got a total score of 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his last thrust of 175 kilos, as well as his second.
In the third attempt, the weights rose along with the fierce roaring.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
A Finnish buyer’s joy was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian attacker Prosa - Veikkausliitto - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemen Ball Association, playing in the Men’s Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with the Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player on our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played on the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new attacker when last season’s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Defiant Modern Family Star shone again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has been known as Alex Dunphyna as a good friend of the modern family comedy series, is once again blubbering by showing her haughty body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
Lately, 18 - year - old Winter has attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to a much bolder degree.
The star has posed in pictures published on social media in very little clothing and has taken many tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very limited clothing.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can check it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has spent most of his life on television and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years' time, when the decline is already so severe, says a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Instead, some of the fans of the woman defend the actor and urge that they ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women. You're an inspiration to a young woman.
Japanese people prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see the fabulous mirör aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to encourage Japanese people to start their Northern Light Trips in early autumn," says Visit Finland in the press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese northern lights.
Northern lights are a key asset of our winter tourism and they are strongly linked to the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
The winter northern lights in Lapland are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the fall and goes on long into the spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirör aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision twofold fabulous, says Visit Finland’s acting marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the visit Finland’s Northern Light Campaign is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, who live in the city and dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese could use clearer unique sights in Finland, and Lind says that the northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown considerably more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double the number of nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain had to settle for silver in the rugby-7 race when the Fiji champion team won gold.
Britain’s impressive success in the seven-player rugby race was dashed when Fiji won it in the finals at the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday, 43-7.
Fiji taught the masters a lesson in ball handling, transfers, side hallucinations, support games, running lines, and brutal force, and thus won gold — if the country had its first Olympic medal in all its history.
They can be proud of their success in the first-time rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
South African Boxes won a tight win in 7-5 semifinals earlier that day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji’s team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full strength.
Great Britain may find comfort in the fact that at least one British will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach, Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a experience for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in Ryan's training at Adelaide Sevens.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
It hurts to lose, but progress is startling.
Fiji started out excellently and presented his tackle skills to Great Britain as if for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had bumped into a number of moving buses, and world champions took 5-0 to the lead when Osea Kolinisau crashed into the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal.
Situation 12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent tackle prevented the rugged Leone Nakarawa from scoring third goals, but it didn’t slow down Fiji’s progress for long.
After seven minutes of playing, Jasa Veremalu scored the right angle, after which Britain was 17–0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal on the follow-up, when the first half had more than a minute left to play.
After this, Vatemo Ravouvou plunged through the more powerful tackles of the British team and crashed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended with 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British still play apprentice in the sport.
Which is very true.
Britain made large-scale changes during the half-time and managed to hold the Fijians for four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Josua Tuisova scored a goal thanks to the excellent teamplay of the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow it down to 36-7 by scoring a left-hand corner for the UK, but the game had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced.
Fiji’s pure joyous attitude was difficult not to admire.
Mata Viliame made the final touchdown on the Fijian cake by scoring the final moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semi-finals by 20-5 and the United Kingdom had slipped past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the score was solved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony Watson, who is the player of the 15-player rugby team in England, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach’s fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This is as emotional as gold could be in this race.
From the first bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 winning bets into history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the oars were the two, the third sound of Coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women’s duo, made them the first women in the history of British sport to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was indisputable, their victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes joining on the water surface like swans to age, does not fully correspond to the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold there is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the two toward achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who 30 months ago was diagnosed with cancer and who did not then know if he would see today.
According to Williams, the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It'll change your mind a little."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible, if you can even say in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around section 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after victory, the two had their thoughts at Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and had spoken a little more than normal in an effort to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says: "I have been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we worked together with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cash register have been fantastic.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so, thank you so much for her, she's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The duo has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their rivals have failed to match.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very caught in the moment.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drift off the route."
"We managed to leave well, and at the same time we did not try to do anything wonderful.
We didn't reach the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
Two men think a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, a friend of TV’s nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you."
"After London it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed out.
This time it took about four minutes to figure it out.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama data leaks already demand in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that many Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on October 29th.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the population’s rage last spring will affect the election results of the autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear critical attitude towards those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald Trump, president-designate of the U.S. Republicans, withdrew his latest remarks.
He said that he was being sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clintonk was involved in the establishment of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink that low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini bathing suit preferred by Muslims on beaches, reports, among other things, the British newspaper Guardia.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits that display religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorderly behaviour in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a French national day crowd.
At the end of July, two extremists linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Blue algae opacity in Lake Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official beaches in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Blue-algae opacity has only been observed at Lake Pyhäkösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the intervention limits laid down in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and Enterococcal in the bathing water of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae opacity found at Lake Pyhkösjärvi’s beach does not yet make the water unsinkable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, creating blue green algae on the surface of the water as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through frequent inspections.

MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation of forest farm change.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hakkarainen finds criticism in the proposal for a tax change.
A forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income less all other deductions.
According to MKK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the VM assumes that a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry will prevent it from making a loss in the capital income of forestry, which should be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it," Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction bound to the value of the forest is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
He thinks it's too high.
As such, he says it eliminates 82 percent of Finnish forest owners.
The model would affect about 10 per cent of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, the reduction in forest gifts has been taken decades in forestry policy.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years and about half of the forest owners are pensioners.
The heavy hail caught the motorists at Himanga, two cars fell into a ditch and crashed into each other.
A special tail chase took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars running in a row fell into a ditch, after which the one behind came crashing after the time.
According to Harri Pyhätkä, the emergency fire engineer, the derailment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailstorm.
The car behind us had two persons, both of whom were hospitalized.
There's no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver who drove the car above was not injured.
The accident occurred on Route 8 from Himanga to Kalajoki a few kilometres away.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer medicines by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The research results were published on 4 August in Nature Communications, a prestigious journal on cell biology.
Muhos's family home murder continues in court, the prosecutor also asks for a murder sentence for another offender
The threshing of Muhos’ family home murder continues in court for both convicted persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the murder of a family in Muhos.
One was awarded eight years for four months for killing and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
A manslaughter conviction was also convicted of a serious endangerment of road safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle as a young person without entitlement.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the more severely convicted man.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has received a milder sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
At the time of the act, they were in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit in a school home in July last year.
A 17-year-old who was convicted of murder attacked a director sitting from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had come out of the grip and walked the young one into his room, and one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled, beaten, and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the state of mind survey, at the time of the act, both of the convicted were in full understanding.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from a family home, at least from the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, growing only at the age of 156.
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark, which swims around Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't grow until she's 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by an increase of only one centimeter a year.
Only a species of shellfish is known to live longer than the ice shark.
Investigators discovered age in radiocarbon dating.
Because of the nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although the throwing in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a financial savvy - People’s News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the government's total tax revenue would not be received if the change in corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially as a result of tax concessions benefiting the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge sum of $1 000 billion a year that would not be collected.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Mr Trump accused the state of over-regulation in the business sector and of bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards must be renewed and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed as "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Mr Trump, "spoiled" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift up new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his practices, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
A wave from the past - People’s News
The sea roars fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street rage - the reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarized the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy with a Ronski side, the pre-skin Skin where I live (2011) the top of the career of a Spanish guitar.
Gradually Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's an amicable love, relationship and family drama, the focus of which is the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in its pattern with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, from the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will be added to the second leading female role, from the series Ommelte time (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been handled in a way that can be considered a lump, but I myself would say that quite cleverly and literally with a single wipe.
Almodóvar films often have such distinctive brilliance, up to their humor, in Julieta there is a fair distance.
It is a flatly played, restrained, place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish instructor is still there, so that it gradually begins to wink at more as a purely formality than as a working dramatic effect.
Diseases, deaths, or other sudden losses that affect the person in the film, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true for costumes: in the case of a person with a name, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main point is that the setting of the scene in question is not particularly improved.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is outward and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has written the manuscript on the basis of three novels by Alice Munro, a Nobel Prize-winning Canadian.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly evenly written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally superior to the more powerful drama, that much big stuff - especially gnawing guilt - deals with the thematics of the film.
Director and Manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munron's three novels.
Main features: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People’s News
No new cuts are made, saying ministers, so that the Finns of Finland do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided on in the spring are done by a lot.
There won't be any more surgeries.
The 4 billion savings that have already been decided will suffice.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (highly) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits debate.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts are continuing.
♪ The town halls are haunted ♪
Why do ministers insist so strongly that no further cuts are made on them?
Because next year's an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer in the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election results that take government parties in different directions spoil the government's atmosphere for a long time.
The Gallups, however, tell us that the Finnish Government Party expects a defeat, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of Peru received 752 new councillors, many of whom next spring will be realised the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of three or more equal parties rests on the ability of the Finns to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation status have also surfaced.
First of all, there will be no new cuts in the rhetoric that obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out violently and, secondly, an attempt to soften the blow that is waiting for the Finns.
Major surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the target of rescinding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, that is, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands halfway through the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not fold-up or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
It means new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be cut at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring elections, when it comes to parliamentary elections, it will be accepted.
These measures do not give rise to deleveraging
It is quite clear that the current measures do not give way to debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the awareness-raising conference show that this is irrefutable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no drawback from the international economy.
Since the collapse in 2008, the Finnish economy has barely risen, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued at the beginning of the 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and lengthened from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment next year will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns of Peru, of what is responsible.
Query: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that children's day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, as is clear from the KAKS - Research of the Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also assumes responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, regional planning, special care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for people with mental disabilities are the most clearly sought responsibility of the region.
There is no desire to delegate any of the tasks entrusted to the state by the municipalities.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver from Joensuu was driving a police patrol in Joensuu at the Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half a.m.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off driving a police officer to a fair speed.
The chase continued on Sonkajaranta road, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster - footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The driver's breath test showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that justified driving a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo crashed in a ditch at Kulvijärvi on Kavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved corner out of the road and fell into a ditch on its side.
The rescue services picked up the injured driver through the door above the fallen truck, along with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
The owner of the vehicle was left behind to lift the vehicle.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road and sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the Ilmajoki River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä, South Ostrobothnia.

The sightings and clues of missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre’s tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of Parafest’s destruction
The crash that knocked down the tents at the Parafest Festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of Joensuu's Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to get on its way financially, and the event can also be organised next year.
The final performer of Parafest was Kalle Salonen at the end of Friday night in the square.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
When rainwater and its weight initiate a descending air flow, the flow of thunderstorms occur.
Changes in the water form of the thunder cloud bind heat and thus cool down the downward air mass and accelerate its speed toward the earth.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the currents.
The flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four persons were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported to further care with a slight injury.
Air Pollution Ages the Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is told by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people of retirement in London is two and a half years older than that of a person who lives in rural areas, for example.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9 500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel on foot near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with masks, but regular cleaning of the skin is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man to the point of being transported to the central hospital for further research, seriously injured.
The tractor did not run further than that, as it collided with the stones in front of it.

Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jampänen has played in almost all the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now there are already six competitions in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better at North American competitions.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy national team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jampanen, 48, says.
He was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu the kind of sport was not yet played at the SM level like Salibandy.
They played the telegram at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later I played hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series.
Josba played Salibandy's SM series with the university during the 1991-92 season, following three seasons.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club for the championship.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing in the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach Volley’s Finnish championships will be held at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals will be played in the series of both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs of the rankings of each series are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was a member of the Finnish beach volleyball peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the baseball stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals around the corner, Hasu moods.
Kouvola region lit Hasu's spark for sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories in mind about being a kid.
I started volleyball when I was nine years old in the E-girls of Elimäki's NMCA.
On top of it is a jersey too big, knee pads on ankles and huge ace screams and choreographs after a point," Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
We were trained by the father of a teammate, and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyy was already a natural choice of species to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
Songs have been played on the beach in the Archipelago since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the Juniors' SM Tour sectionals myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream is coming true when Hasu plays together with Annina Parkkinen, who beat the shit out of him at the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realist, we have a medal.
SM-Honey, we're still missing the trophy cabinet. Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasu's familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are awaited in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the slippers will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon’s Koli courageously set out to be an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon’s Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Kol, started to work as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on a farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard pole, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was really brave enough to go along with the project and have been fully involved in it," says Solomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would turn out all right.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has been successful, since Solomon's Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen to more than zero since October last year, when the country reported a positive inflation rate of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation rate measured by CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (in July 2016 compared to December 2015 per cent) has been –0.2 per cent, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was –0.2 per cent.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, increases were observed in the prices of the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, dwellings, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's anime effect is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was inspired by an anime, but some observers find it racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, some 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity in ways that bring absurdity closer.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lentils are unstamped, perplexing tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All false steps quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have been criticized, where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes crooked, twisted their teeth and made their cheeks chubby, some critics called it racist caricature from Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated contradictions refer to the greater problem the company has with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and were written about it on, for example, the web pages The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat reported that they removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was meant to be a tribute to the anime characters, not to the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently denied the anime parable.
The Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the parallelisation of a very tasteless Asian caricature with the effects of a filter.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but one that has been taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that has to avoid these cultural traps.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, ranging from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s general audience consists of young people who are more diverse in ethnic background than their older counterparts. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, things of this kind no longer go unnoticed as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and designer working on a medium publication platform, decided to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published in Medium, he said that he believed that ethnic contradictions reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the management of the company, consisting mostly of white men and men only, and decided to write with hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either the case that there are no colored people in their one-sided staff, so that they can make decisions of this kind, or that they also have colored workers, but their position is not such as to dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, claiming its position as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but according to its spokesman, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented groups of people and the promotion of inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congressional Group of Experts, military officials falsified intelligence on the ISIS.
On Thursday, the Congressional Group of Experts published a report according to which US military officers, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events in the field gave rise to.
The Republican Chairmans of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Defence Resources of the House of Representatives Committee set up a working group to report in the interim report on the "general discontent" of military intelligence analysts.
Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the US military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the senior executives of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism activities than the facts on the ground showed, and were invariably more positive than those of the analysis of other units of the intelligence community", states a press release on the report.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when the high-level political decision-makers are presented with false analyses," says Ken Calvert, California's Republican Representative.
"Centcom's management errors extend to the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report details in detail the continuing problems of the Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although the report does not contain any conclusive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama’s administrations have been falsified, it gives an idea of the analysts that Centcom’s leaders would have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and statements made to Congress were much more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"For example, Centcom's official made a public statement that a large military raid on the return of Mosul could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative of Kansas, in the press release.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, intelligence leaders in the United States armed forces were manipulating the intelligence results obtained in order to undermine the threat of ISIS in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a task force after learning of the suspicions expressed by analysts that intelligence on ISIS had been manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies are still ongoing.
In addition, the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the House's inquiry committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," says Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's senior Democrat representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of intelligence results, "infringed the morals of analysts" and "considered insufficiently differing views".
However, according to Mr Schiff and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to the 'predicted or political official line'.
On Tuesday, the Daily Beast reported on the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon’s Chief Inspector General, which was initiated as a result of actions brought by Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, says in his press release that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congressional Report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says: "Experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has further repercussions, in addition to seeking to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by several defence authorities).
However, the claims made last year questioned how much President Obama can trust Central Command and that it will give honest assessments of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of ISIS intelligence corresponds to the disagreements that arose over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study according to which President George W. Bush's government, despite the protests of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time considering what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against ISIS intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite opposing public statements, the air strikes against Isis’ controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries and was thus able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not transmitted outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
The then commanding officer of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised last year after many legislators had estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of Central Command.
United States wins the fourth duel in women's field hockey and consolidates its position in the conflict with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the US Women’s Hockey National Team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had ever done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep track of their goals."
But he knows this: in their Olympic tournament the Americans have won four games and lost zero games and share in their group the first place with Britain, who continued to win their winning streak on Thursday with Japan’s 2-0.
Britain and the United States are playing against each other on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the finals, which determine which of them will be the first of the six teams and which will be the second.
The first to avoid a longer-term encounter with the Dutch team, who won the second block.
Despite what happens in Saturday’s game, the Americans have already made a fuss about their surprising success in this race, four years after it was last seen by 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell in the state of Pennsylvania and took a field hockey bat for the first time before he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played a sport in Drexel).
He missed the 2008 Olympic Games when he failed to make the final list of players.
This was followed by the 2012 competitions, where he and his team did not see much success.
The following year Craig Parnham, an English coach, was appointed, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We've turned around."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the score at the first half by hitting the ball near the back of his knuckle.
India had entered the game without a tournament win, but it proved surprisingly hard to resist and kept the 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam drove the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, squirmed to the middle field, hit the ball in the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first tournament in which the US goaltender Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games the American goal had sunk in each one hit.
Briggs is now living in his season of success.
Just like Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good it depends on the result of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic Hulina, the trampoline brings Zen.
No matter where and when you go to the Olympics, you're bound to run into the Olympics.
Rio de Janeiro’s events, competitions and struggles seem to follow as a passionate message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton, moving from a archer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast, and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky, or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympic first-time Dooley charms with his smile and might well be a name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong at the best viewing and listening time, would be favored by sponsors and would appear in good-mind TV commercials if he was just a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
Olympic fire does not illustrate all competitions on an equal footing.
Far further from the centre, partly in the shade are the less well-known sports, such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We'll always have a breaststroke, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the gentle charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility over the past 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be territorial.
Although athletes from the United States have participated in the Olympic trampoline, the country has never reached the medals or entered the finals until 2012.
In the men’s trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and the Russians, and on the women’s side, the Canadians have taken the medal.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend gold medals that they won in London this year.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympic Games.
(I recognize in this context that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comical potential, which has been used in cartoons in the endless bouncing scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming leaps, i.e. species that are essentially combined in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolin, which means "a stepping board".
Ambitious champions jump with a huge trampoline that throws them at a height of nearly 10 meters. Before landing, jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are judged by performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline gymnastics, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of Olympic sports is straight ahead.
When reaching for gold, hope must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or the starting wall, they also have another goal to pursue in televised reports, namely the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical — and even enough to make a spectator tear.
But I also find this a little tiring just to watch the games.
This is where the trampoline offers a breather.
In the trampoline, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up like an astronaut with no weight, falls down, and goes straight back up.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a fierce rush to the finish line or a leap far, just a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as the Olympic Games can get.
Women’s qualifiers and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will start at 1.00 p.m. local time and men’s respective races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of their afternoon broadcast, which will start at 2 p.m. local time on each day.
In the midst of Olympiamania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that might go unnoticed in the midst of a general riot.
And if awareness can only be enhanced by offering and objectifying male athletes who are appealing to be viewed – as recently suggested by US male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new wave of fans.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long - term ally of the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have violently dismantled demonstrations that call for political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protestors have been shot dead in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries and a reliable ally of the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to ever larger areas.
Just last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was ruthless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed several unarmed protestors.
The videos depicted at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year are supposed to show how security forces beat up young people with sticks who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping the country united has always been difficult, and moving forward even harder," says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence service are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, will receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Ababa even has a new urban train.
The streets of cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still a long way from being a model country for democracy; human rights organisations have constantly reported on the repressive policies of the regime, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to protest, it will burst out," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"All the young people are protesting.
An entire generation protested."
There are many issues of discontent, ranging from land use to government coalition strangulation from power.
After the elections, which were widely criticised last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last post that belonged to the opposition, and as a result they now dominate Parliament as a whole.
At the same time, tensions are increasing along the Eritrean border, where the worsening situation in June required hundreds of deaths.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less subdued separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are many reasons why the bitter mood that has been lurking under the surface for years is breaking out right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media, as cheaper smartphones became commonplace and internet availability improved.
Even when the government repeatedly obstructs access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many access the Internet through proxy servers that hide their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this was how they invited people to demonstrations.
The second reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest population groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amhars.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharas, mainly from the Christian Highlands, have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have just taken place in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oromomas feel that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and yet dominates the army, the intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
According to analysts, he was especially skilled in detecting the first signs of discontent and in using ambassadors who compromised between opposing parties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, stepped in Meles' boots, almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he does not have the confidence of the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear that this will mean more bloodshed.
The last time there were similar riots in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands of people protested against the elections, which the analysts said were first screwed up by the government and then stole.
In post - election unrest, many protesters were killed, although the number of deaths was lower than in the previous months, and the unrest ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal resentment against the Ethiopian Government has clearly not prevented it from getting stronger.
And a grudge is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in the Amhara city of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by tigres, and hate speech against tigres is becoming more common in social media.
According to analysts, protests are putting the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The United States Government has used Ethiopia as a base for drones that have not been occupied, which have monitored Somalia, but has recently closed the base, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires strict balancing," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back in his latest campaign dispute by claiming that he was not serious about claiming that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Isis.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters also find themselves in a awkward situation, who have to try to justify their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made an argument at an election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the President and Hillary Clinton created Isis.
On Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that his claim was sarcasm.
Trump gave his speech in tweets all the time the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was very serious about his accusations.
When the radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back off.
The most recent review storm rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back on the economy as the support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton gave their speech on economic policy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and he found Clinton’s speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was being sarcastic."
In this way Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that are responsive to his supporters. He sees how the supporters react to messages, and then "clears up" depending on the reactions," says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has been watching the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to penetrate different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has in recent days even made his style even more striking as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new opinion poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist published on Friday reported that Trump’s support for Clinton is significantly lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida has a tight level playing field.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But in the last months of his presidential campaign, ever more closely monitored, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments no matter how provocative.
One of Trump’s main supporters, former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider his words to be a well-founded, political speech," answered Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded Isis.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama called completely incorrectly “the lower-series team” and that’s why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.”
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama administration, in which Hillary Clinton was the Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to continue its efforts when it failed to deal with the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of dwelling on his speeches and a discriminatory attitude toward him.
He mocked the "indecent and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they cannot succeed.
Some democrats mocked Trump's explanation and said that it would only show more clearly that he was not fit to be president.
Due to an excessive rent increase, the café will open at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a busty coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash became a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but it offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its streetside on Bedford Avenue when the rent became unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in summer 2014, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
The locals find this loss of coffee shop, which has been sidelined from under the middle class, to be saddened.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there's no CBGB anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York isn't what it used to be, it's creating a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just over a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
Coffee's still good, too.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café.
He started at the Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new coffee shop, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the way they were.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it reactivated even the old Verbi lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, that he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-icken-cheese-sandwiches available and capers and brown onion rings to fill.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
No more beer at the café, but juices made from fresh fruit.
After nine months of holding the coffee shop, Rodriguez says that he noticed that old standard customers began to visit the Verb in a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited a coffee shop recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he took walks to the Verbi, then located in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I thought I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a new list.
Another long - term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go to a coffee shop before work, and he ordered the same thing without exception.
"I walked into the coffee shop every day at 7:15, like a machine, and there they already made my butterbag with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Now Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bagel to bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge about the soap shop taking over the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to produce a special soap, which is made with Verbi’s own cold - brewed coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Polish people who lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to welcome his new neighbors.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the coffee shop's cold-fried coffee.
The café may also expand into the building next door.
However, for many customers it is enough that they get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular in Williamsburg, and he says his heart broke when the coffee shop closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it was like coming home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of coffee shop."
The sad food of the Great Depression in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as a culturer, was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his menu was more modest: Devil’s eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for people who suffered," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds: "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The Brooklyn Heights couple both work as food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the big stock market crash, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was well suited for the discussion of eating a large depression.
"The murders were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut loaf, liverloaf and bean loaf.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for a whole meal."
Andrew Coe is making fun of me.
"It must have weighed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the great years of depression, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you like".
The women fed the farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, freshly baked pies were served.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronic of the ways in which the people survived when they suddenly had to give up their abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing subject for the Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One distressing thing was the new low - cost diet: Ziegelman said that mysterious foods such as meatloafs and casseroles became the main food, and casseroles were said to be a “great way to take advantage of food residues” because chefs could hide non - attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the central part of the American meal for years, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange blends were tried, where the most important thing was to meet calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
When doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven bulbs filled with peanut butter as a food for the time of shortage.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion don't mix at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to be meaningful budget managers and to meet the challenge of making tasty dishes like carrots and creams.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the reactions of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's 'let me eat cake' attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on a Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated master who had become him.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in a gold-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, the food served in the White House was not only the most boring in Washington but also the worst prepared."
Many of the depression food was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition is still evident in how we pay attention to calories and nutrition and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple say that they began to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of throwing away food," say Coe.
"People even began to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, one time, wind hats."
After the main dishes were emptied at the lunch bar in Eisenberg, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they made at home, the same food that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman and adds that giving an impressive name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream, just plums, little flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
We were reluctantly immersing our spoons in thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe did it for the second time and the third.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.
For Gilead, full compensation for legal fees for patent litigation with Merck for hepatitis C
The judge of the U.S. Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it received for the patent dispute with Merck & Co Inc., the pharmaceutical manufacturer.
Gilead was released in June for damages of $200 million for the violation of two patents owned by Merck in connection with successful medicines named Sovaldi and Harvoni Gilead. A judge in the United States found Merck to have committed violations involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In an application registered on Thursday, judge Beth Labson Freeman of the Regional Court of the United States states that Gilead was entitled to exemption from the legal fees it was entitled to defend the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat over 90 percent of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported troops have taken Manbij City from ISIS
The U.S.-supported forces have taken possession of Manjib, a city near the Turkish border in northern Syria, when the last extremist Isis fighters left the city, reports the spokesman.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city to find the last Isis fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the military council of Manbij, is part of the SDF, informed Reuters that 2 000 hostages kidnapped by Isis fighters have been released.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
On Friday, the Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced its 2015 tax return, which shows that her and her husband’s income at that time amounted to $10.75 million and that they paid a real federal tax rate of 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly 5.3 million dollars in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, a foreign minister, announced that he had earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster for his book on his term of office in the State Department.
Clinton's vice president, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, announced ten years of tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate paid by them in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to model financial transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a press release.
In complete contrast, Donald Trump hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
According to custom, the US presidential candidates have always made their tax records public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
A New York businessman, Trump, and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Administration for an audit and call it the reason why Trump has not published his income data.
"The transfer is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the tax records of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Legal Assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax records until the checks were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s equity, his contributions to charity, business relations and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this question and released a video online on Friday, where he brings out prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing for decades and not public tax returns," said Clinton to the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump paid no taxes or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist quoted on Friday several tax lawyers and auditors that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become the central issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent of the tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters are located in the same place as Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both disclose their tax records.
Buffet says that he too has been audited by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in the town of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 % of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate paid by them was about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income amounting to USD 109 000.

Chili powdered firecracker condoms to support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human settlements — elephants being harassed by throwing chili - filled condoms at them.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, invented a few years ago, together with the American Nature Conservation organization, has launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and plantations without harming elephants.
Not long ago, spears were used to stir up elephants.
Friday is a world elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
"After developing the method, we have seen changes in attitudes in these villages, because now the villagers can count on them to keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is harassed with a flashlight and a horn.
If this does not work, throw the so-called chili cloud.
The ground chili powder is placed in the condom together with the firecracker, and then the end of the condom is twisted so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes and spreads into the air a fine cloud of chili powder.
Usually one cloud of spice is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last way is to shoot into the air a fireworks known as a Roman candle and create a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes the Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s area code from the Arab “call” – RT News
The French film director, from his roots, gave birth to the media when he revealed that the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin did not mention Israel's area code in its country code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, expressed his frustration at the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the directory of areas offered by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among countries where you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call centre.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist’s reply upset him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was a "decision carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the action shocked the film director even further.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs and they are calling for Israel's area code to be deleted."
The German Ambassador of Israel Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, called the case "a great shame".
"The incident is shocking and shocking to all of us.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and this is precisely the hotel chain.
That's all the explanations you need.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction in the network, where it was called scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply yielding to the claims of alleged Arab customers.
"Damn" was said in a release that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel denied the charges quickly, called it a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to exclude Israel from the list of areas was never given," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski's representative.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets in a demonstration of Brazilian students
The students met with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered together to protest against the government’s reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The riot began when law enforcement tried to disintegrate a group of students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration, who wanted to express their dismay at the plans of the government.
The Governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a austerity measure in which nearly 100 public schools are closed down and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Some protestors made graffiti on walls temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, the president's office.
The demonstration of the students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with protestors in favour of the expelled President Dilma Roussef when the Senate of the country voted on this matter.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
Since the expatriation of sanctions, the annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent, says Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan to Iran.
He said that the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
Russian companies will continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further trade growth is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to USD 158 million.
The trade was accelerated by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran granted Iranian citizens some 35 000 visas, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia for the first time.
And it is not too bold to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran, on the other hand, is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to the finish line when the British won the bicycling gold.
The Scottish Callum Skinner challenged the reputation of the men's team prince at Rio's Velodrome last night, when the British trio defended the London 2012 title.
In Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner played the anchor role he inherited from his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoy. The young man proudly made the legend when he raced to the finish line and won the victory from the pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after being ranked sixth in the World Rally Championship in March in London, despite Hoy’s subsequent career in competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, the first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was the man the British coaches believed in, where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes, with Hoy the winner of the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic record in the time run, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was a little behind after his tour, but Kenny pushed for the team’s leadership, which Skinner retained.
A large part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace with a larger gear, which enabled Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they entered the podium.
In Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track because of a bad start.
Later he withdrew his words and Britain’s rivals had no appeal.
This time, there were no problems of this kind with the sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the British tickets were flying in the stands.
Our team became united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the victory at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the last five months, then five days of velodrom have been successful.
As Kenny has demonstrated with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold in one Olympics.
This would mean an increase in the account with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medallions would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and settles in three days.
A Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "At this moment, I can only rejoice in this.
It's always the best team race.
You'll enjoy winning together with your friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have the knight's rank."
This was the only medal competition today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team-run.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record made in London in 2012 and won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (at 22.42 p.m.) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had an argument with the competition agents before the time run when the trustees invited him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milngavie, reached world record time 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its great track cycling team to take over the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, the least of which is the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of allegations of sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on velodrom on the first night show that Britain's already legendary reputation is once again being realized at the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland melting plant at stake due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium smelter in Portland, the state of Victoria, and therefore the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the electricity-supply company told the melting plant that one of the factory owners is about to terminate the supply contract and that it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue with the subsidies to keep the factory in operation.
Fixed aid for 20 years will expire in November.
The Alcoa Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of the closures, up to 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of Anglesea's power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland meltdown company is losing money and is in danger of being forced to close its doors.
These measures correspond to years of speculation about the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the cost of manufacturing the factory.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, expects the other three smelter owners to terminate their contracts.
The factory is owned by a joint venture formed by Alcoa and Alumina. The Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shareholdings in the factory.
AGL says that it expects the Portland plant to remain operational, which means that the physical demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue.
AGL states that the contracts are so-called hedge contracts, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for contracts is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"Aggregates therefore expect the contracts to generate revenue for the financial year 2017", says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects in terms of wholesale electricity prices.
AGL already claims to have reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by USD 187 million as a "forecast for the termination of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... capacity to keep the melting plant in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant".
The American company said that it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn from the agreement.
Due to the weak financial situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessment of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, operational director of AGL, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses around 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
"If these plants exit the market, it will mean a significant drop in demand (electricity) in the market.
For us as a producer, that would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians Real Television Star Kendall as the cover girl of September Vogue
The Kardashian-Jenner clan model and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris Kendall Jenner, 20, pose in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and performs during Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover photo was released following a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashians-series style?), a scripted video with all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar jams Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Ryan Seacrest, the Kardashians programme producer) showing that they forgot their sister's cover. The video ends in a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost every birthday of the degree shows (Seecrest says the words: "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the children's morning cartoon character), but Kris had to get his other daughters into this publicity in some way.
Its appearance in the September Vogue issue undoubtedly marks a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have made Vogue’s application before (she appeared on Vogue’s cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling publication per year.
A number of advertisers are attracted to a larger image book than a fashion magazine-like number (the fashion site from Fashion calculated that there were 615 pages of advertisements in last year's 832 page opus).
The release of the September issue’s cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the previous two years the pictures of the magazine have been leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previously the cover models of September have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities working on the cover rather than models who are famous.
Oscar winner and Dior ad face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and one year later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is more likely to be one of the illustrious members of the model’s work, he is in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even though Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career when she published her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his reality TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitch".
These feelings have resurfaced as the news of Jenner’s appearance on Vogue’s cover came out.
However, the constant vexation of discontent seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for the September Vogue issue.
He's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking through Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup cream.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through pay-per-view apps.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she was filming for Love magazine.
And in her spare time, she's on reality TV, maybe just a way to meet her sister and her kids.
Legal Aid Centres turn 160 000 people away per year
Every year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries are being turned away from legal aid centres and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional cuts in appropriations will have on centres already operating at extreme borders.
In Queensland, three of the five people who apply for free legal aid and legal services are already being turned away – most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload has already been overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, says that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Association of Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away each year.
If the federal government doesn't spin its decision, Farrell says it's going to get worse.
"Queensland Public Legal Aid Centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be turned away when they apply for the essential services they need," says Farrell.
"People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, divorced families, unwarranted workers – all have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can obtain the legal aid they need.
Last year the state administration fulfilled its promise to bring the financing of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump's campaign was sued for threatening an employee with a gun.
New York: An action was brought against Donald Trump’s campaign when no action was supposed to be taken after its leadership was told that the campaign leader in North Carolina had threatened the employee with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action brought by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor in the state campaign, on Wednesday in the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says that he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally in the campaign before, according to his own words, he realized that this was not going to happen.
In his lawsuit, Bordini says campaign manager Earl Phillip "put out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and put the pipe in Vincent's kneecap."
According to the application, after making a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it causes damage," says Bordini in his suit.
The action will come only two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a general rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that "constituents of the second pillar" – who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts – can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and is allowed to elect judges.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his words from the context and Trump’s words did not encourage violence.
In his action, Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifference and from Phillip for assault, assault and the mental suffering they cause.
Trump’s publicist Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to a message asking him to comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency, WCCB, reported that Phillip recently dropped out of the campaign.
No immediate response to the call was received from Phillip’s consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, has been engaged in a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For me, this was an issue that was of greatest interest to Heathrow. As at the London Olympics in 2012, we made a huge effort to ensure that the entire nation and all our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We are doing this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10 000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which will eliminate youth unemployment in the neighbourhood of the airport.
As at the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who feel that the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that in the eyes of the rest of the world we will find ourselves in an awkward situation.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna be wrong about Heathrow too.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by £211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment both to the environment of the airport and to the whole of the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow who has implemented in time and budget a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, which included a T5 terminal – which has been voted the best flight terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and a T2 terminal that was built in the middle of the two world's most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a £16 billion private investment.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow's Board and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook for anti-advertising cat-mouse games
The attempts of companies that earn their money from online advertising to mislead anti-advertising software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces blocking software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on its own page that it would block advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it told users that they could update their blocking software filters and thus again block community service ads.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would change the advertising labelling codes on its desktop site so that it is more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock tells me he's got the new codes.
In his blog article, Adblock’s publicist Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of ball-balling between the open source anti-advertising community and the deceivers has been going on ever since the advertising barrier was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon be doing its own repair business again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertising producers have become in this sector.
Globally, an estimated 200 million people use anti-advertising programmes, reports a survey carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. This figure has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily on mobile devices by 1.03 million active users, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading anti-advertising programs in its desktop application, as according to the publicist, mobile advertising blocking programs do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The income from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the investment worthwhile.
On Tuesday Facebook also told us that they are updating the user settings advertising tool so that users can have more control over how to target them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticizes Adblock’s new filters, as they also prevent the appearance of some ordinary Facebook writings.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem,” said Facebook’s publicist in his email newsletter.
"Maintenance prevention programmes are clumsy and ineffective, and we have therefore invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertisements themselves."
She committed suicide by leaving herself under cars on a Swiss highway.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of eyewitnesses on the highway for the first hours of Thursday in an accident where a woman deliberately left herself under more than one car.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway in Vaudi canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate thing by lying down on the dark road, and she was hit by several cars, says Vaudin police in her press release.
The victim was a 49-year-old female in Switzerland and was clearly seeking suicide, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports in Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this kind of situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges are being brought against the drivers involved in the accident.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
That remains for the prosecution to find out," says Hofstetter.
Two similar cases have taken place over the last five years, which do not justify the liability of motorists.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked on the highway in the dark and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year the police officer was released from the charge of manslaughter on a man who was on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on one of the night of August 2014.
The court found out that a 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court held that the police — who were responding to an emergency call — were justified and that the man on the road was ‘a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation’.
On Thursday, everyone near Morges is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus’ past with the same tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions in Venus could at times have been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous, and its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to the scientists ’ earlier presentations, Venus’ slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere corresponding to the earth and has nevertheless been running slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than on earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"In the modeling of GISS, Venus rotates slowly and its daytime is almost two months at a time for the sun," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and creates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface in large part of the sun’s heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures are up to a few degrees lower than current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create Venus’ story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its evolution.
Even though Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned vaporized water.
In hydrogen karate, only a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect — Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up his position as Avalanche coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club’s hockey operations, arguing for lack of influence in the team’s decision-making.
Vice President/Director Joe Sakic of Colorado confirmed the news and announced that the club will immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as head coach for the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice president of the club’s hockey activities vigorously, passionately and decisively," says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
"I have spent a long time and a great deal of time thinking about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed and raise it to a higher level.
In order for this to be achieved, the coach and the club’s vice-president of hockey must be on the same lines as the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions affecting the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him well for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league’s best coach of the year for his first season as Head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not been able to reach the extension period in the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 power points during the 2015–2016 period and stayed five points away from Minnesota Wild during the second Wild Card game at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens’ ranks and two in the Avalanche ranks.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators say that the North Sea oil workers' wage strikes will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil-field services, has been subject to strikes on drilling platforms in the North Sea under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, 'Wood Group and Trade Unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to resume the process in order to resolve the dispute'.
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several day-long meetings over the next few weeks to deal with the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in over 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut its North Sea contractors' tariffs by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in the countries in 20114.
According to the company, additional cuts give it the room necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut off thousands of employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thereby improving its operations with the British energy company BG Group after its mega-fusion.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the British decision to leave the European Union in June will put pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish MEP, met with the workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work conflicts in the North Sea for a whole generation.
He said that the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country, we need an economy that benefits many people and not just a few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to spend less than $1.4 billion in 2016, compared to around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiadi Cluster
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rate of rotation of the stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list so far of the rotational speeds of the Pleiad stars.
On the basis of new information, astronomers are able to determine why stars of the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how cycles are associated with planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other constellations we will learn more about the relationship between star weight and age, and even the history of its solar system," says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre of the University of Caltech in Pasadena.
The Pleiad Cluster is located 445 light years from the earth.
Many of the stars of the constellation were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adulthood.
They're spinning faster than ever right now.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of starwind burst from the growing stars.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they advance through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star grows older, the speed of its rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of identifiable star spots (corresponding to sunspots).
The latest recorded rotational speed data suggest that the larger stars rotate slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — bigger ones roll slower than smaller ones.
"We can see from the "dance" of the Plejads that those who are slow are typically larger, while those who are fastest are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the Pleiad constellation is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars in relation to rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian Cluster offers a pillar for theoretical models for the rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to know a lot more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiads in their three new articles, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
