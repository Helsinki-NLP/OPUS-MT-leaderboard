A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping center's stairwell this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, “His affairs were finally going well.”
The body found at the Westfield Mall shopping center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfrancisco Frank Galicia, said San Francisco coroner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was determined as a homicide and that an investigation is under way.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a bus chef in Boston, had received his dream job as a line chef at the Sanfranca Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A representative of Sons & Daughters said they were "frightened and shocked" by his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he will be missed very much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank spent the night at the beginning of the hostels, but that recently "his affairs were finally going well".
"He found an apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was benevolent and had a great heart.
His way of feeling together with the family was to cook for us, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drifted along with the river.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone brighter every day," he said.
Anyone with any information on this matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department hotline 415-575-4444.
Medical trainees on strike: Requirements for new industrial action
The representatives of the doctors' trainees have asked their trade union to adopt new industrial battle measures in their dispute over the new agreement.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) calls on the Council as a whole to support new industrial action from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
Medical interns and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement that had been concluded with BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of the members who voted.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night via Twitter, the chairman of JDC, Ellen McCourt, said that the government had remained 'continuously silent' on the issues which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the completely proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiations of all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to authorise a progressive and expanding industrial action programme starting early in September.
The dispute has resulted in doctors' trainees participating in six strikes this year, including the first complete stoppage in the history of the NHS health system.
The director of BMA medical interns, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had rejected the terms of the agreement, recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 54 000 medical trainees and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be imposed on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
Ele, who ended in a crisis.
On Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met to shake hands and to declare the eight-month struggle for words and economic sanctions officially closed.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had the clear impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
Yes, they shook hands at the event.
But Putin’s smile looked forceful, and he did not breathe much heat, even according to his own restrained standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan kept talking about his "loving friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I lost count.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as having acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal reflected the opposite.
But the coolness of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at that time was fierce.
Putin attacked Duckara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from an assumed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, government - controlled media led to an amazing, profound attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
Among the most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in the Syrian territories dominated by Isis.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it is time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received his request for an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of settling a severe truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was almost overthrown in the failed coup d'état last month.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian economic sanctions have been heavy, especially the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when the flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season to rush into the Mediterranean.
And as early as this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since agricultural imports from Turkey are again allowed.
"Tourned there, the tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report put it.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In Ankara, people are angry at the West for what is considered to be a weak response to the attempted coup d'état.
Adding to it a long-standing resentment over the fast-track negotiations on EU membership of the snail, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the coolness and crush Turkey's ties with the West, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly got loose points from Ankara, to which he called after the revolutionist attempt to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a clear story for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting at the pleasant seaside palace enabled Russia and Turkey to introduce a 'external alliance', as an analyst described to me: two countries that feel that they have been abandoned and mistreated by the West, to join forces.
However, these two have major disagreements despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite.
It may be very talkative that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even dealt with it.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question in relation to their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and in view of the possibility of a total disaster when a NATO member shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are back on speaking terms.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued, it has abandoned these goals.
During this time, the Bank’s strategies have used the ‘RBS’ brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland is used with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange listings will be converted into NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed for a tour of clients and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will be our investor brand and employee employer, because we will now become a much more brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives; we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of different brands in its sport sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to move towards the brands bank, because basically (we’ve been asking) it’s about how we can focus on making this a better bank for our customers,” the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on our customers' needs, not ours, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in New Market with Predilection and wins 3,000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after he has a total of 3,000 wins after the double win.
The racer Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3,000th British victory in New Market on Friday.
He reached a milestone in his second victory on his home track, competing with John Gosden’s coached Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the race.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey dettori, who once won Ghayar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in New Market because here I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
Dettori is sucking up cheers when he takes out Predilection after victory.
Two riders have reached this milestone in obstacle contests... master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, with over 4,300 victories in his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggot, 9 times Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best riders of the present era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He's classy and strong, but his tactical intelligence separates him from the others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to the competitions, his enthusiasm and charisma have been pulling fans into the sport for years.
A few weeks ago I told Frankie in Epsom that he would have rode 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a jockey for weekends and big games!
Seriously, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person who's a good thing for British competition, but he's also an amazing jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a flying descent from the saddle.
From flying stops to jogging landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of a British race for two decades.
It's been a roller coaster.
A lot of winnings in big games, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane accident and suffered a non-compete drug.
Three years ago, when he returned after six months of non-compete, he had a hard time at first, but he showed considerable strength of character in challenging skeptics and returning in his best condition.
And he may go on for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement stated that Putin "has ordered Ivanov to leave the post of President of Russia", but he was not given any reason to do so.
The Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, Anton Vainto, has been appointed his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia, in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later he headed the president's protocol and government staff, called the Kremlin's website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task for the administration is to support your activities as Head of State in drafting the laws and in managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that the persecution be replaced.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, acted as the Soviet Security Service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a state television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew at his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official argument that a man who was once promoted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy has been received with real scepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complicated, even laborious, task for four years.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
This was approved by Ivanov in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Director of the State Security Service in FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Director.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
On one occasion it was thought that Ivanov could become President Putin of Russia after the second term, since Put's third term would have been unconstitutional.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister just three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
"Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got fired after hitting a producer."
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the set location in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Mr Gibson, acting as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how to remove Gibson's character from the FBI team will be expected later.
A 54-year-old who has previously starred in Dharma & Greg has been in the series since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the past 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that is not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans the show can have.
The beginning of the 12th production season of the series is scheduled for September 28th.
Mysterious fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windfish left behind by a water vortex.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, published film material from the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two - inch - long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife
The GBP 1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry’s crossing and the bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the deck lines that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 gauze ropes.
The GBP 1.35 billion project is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from country to bridge.
He said: "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossing point.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering effort in this project, which has spent more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone to build this section of the bridge."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the barrier between the bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which extreme precision measures must fit together.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck is being cast in Rosyth today, which means that the whole deck is ready to be put on the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this barrier represents the leading edge of construction technology.
After the last section of the road deck had been installed and combined with the expanding road cover of the northern pillar, we then had to close the remaining section of the north, i.e. inland.
This was done by pulling the bridge of the northern fairway 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and, at the same time, very demanding measure.
Huge, because the bridge is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn at an angle of gradient of about 3%.
Very demanding, because the tolerances allowed for the team to work were tiny, only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, however, everything went well.
Rescue on Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they're alive" after they fell off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station alarmed at 1.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Gulf of Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety as their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat moving closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the helm of the Moelfre lifeboat.
"Good thing the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, 60 years old, was found weary hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
The men were taken into the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
There was a kill rope on the boat's engine, but it was somehow separated from the person who was driving the boat when the boat crashed.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have been concerned that teenagers and children will no longer go out to play, but rather spend their leisure time watching screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and participate in some activity.
The display time was originally limited to television, then to video games and now to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to a fad called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s in video games (later they produced a series of drawings, playing cards and other follow-up products).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the release of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the release of the game in other countries was postponed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
Only in days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons, which are tracked by GPS, and which can be found after "photographs" (the screen capture of the phone) or "catch".
A generation who played the game when they were younger has joined the fad and jumped off the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the "average person".
The Apple Watch application Cardiogram, which follows 35 000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of users following Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it only sees training levels.
Many public health campaigns called for "find 30", "nouse on the couch" and "be active every day" have produced no result because most public health warnings are boring and careable by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are at a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes. Its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even make new friends when they hunt.
As usual, disapproving ridiculers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk into the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
While there were previously applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give cause for movement in the same way as this game.
The novelty disappears and the use wears off in time.
However, because of Pokémon’s success, there will be other games that link applications and virtual reality to the real world’s activity, helping many hunting people to be more active, better conditioned and healthier.

Simone Biles picked up gold in a women's gymnastics complex.
Forget the pressure.
Forget the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all of it.
He's energetic when he jumps.
It's good on the boom.
I can't believe this perm.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast achieved a multiplicity championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world out in the Olympic spotlight.
He had a total score of 62.198 that was clearly better than the silver medalist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Alya Mustafina.
Simone Biles at the balance boom in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman who has won the multiplicity championship in a row, and the fifth American champion overall. At the same time, she strengthened her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps the best of all time.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same class as the other best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have brought their sport to a new level:
For the past three years, Biles has dominated his species, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose combination of ambition and precision has been so amazing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
The final test was awaited in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles, on the left of the United States, and Aly Raisman hugging after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finale of women's scaffolding gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday when he was the culmination at the departure party of the retired national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he went on his long way to the top, it is not entirely truthful.
Part of his permanto program, which includes the volt-hitting of his trademark, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be perfect for the street next to the Rio Olympic arena.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, whom Coach Aimee Boorman’s mother found while she was on a study trip at the gym where Borman trained, has become a force.
He hasn't lost in a multiplicity since summer 2013, and this winning streak should last as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in the small lead after two laps, it was just an illusion.
The balance boom and the floor where Biles is the reigning world champion were waiting.
He reached the point at the boom points on 15,433 and crossed them by receiving 15,933 perm.
Raisman hugged him with goodwill as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears rose into the eyes of Bales with glitter red, white and blue, when the dream that he once wrote in his scrapbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some kind of rematch from four years ago when he was in third place, but lost the bronze to Mustafina in the rerun.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
After his permanence, he sent kisses to the public, emotional about a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as Party is concerned, the widespread tweeting of this 19-year-old from the previous week brings a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims were shot in a serial murder while listening to music in the car
The two women who died in the most deadly attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in the last decade and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in a police bulletin published on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis ’ daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked in the driveway on 12 June.
The report says that the shooter standing on the passenger’s side of the car fired the handgun up to eight times and then fled by another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple homicide doesn't seem to have been the result of the robbery, since the assailant didn't take the purses or the $2,900 from the other adult victim.
A representative of the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting led the investigators to see if it was related to the four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have died and two have been injured during the nine attacks that have taken place over four months in two main Latin - American districts.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," Howard said earlier this month to CBS' subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists have refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and are made by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
An eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also released a police bulletin on a shooting that took place only half an hour before the triple homicide, targeting an empty pickup truck, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings in the bullet's seat and bullet fragments in the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It will be easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about when she was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first idea was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which is not at all true - of course I agreed," he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never learn to recognize them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund's walking around with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sings.
Elizabeth will show you how the signs Edmund invented sign for "sing for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language. He tells me that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
Microcephaly may be due to a number of different causes: genetic infections such as Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy such as measles or Zika virus.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's gonna happen?
And he still doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
Believe me, it'll get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana caused the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and the southern Mississippi flooded their banks and caused a massive flood threat due to extremely heavy rains.
John Bel Edwards, governor of Louisiana, said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the needy counties.
Mike Steele of the Governor’s Security and Emergency Response Office said that they would receive requests for high water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangi Devil County alone asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood watch is valid until Saturday in much of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional three to five cents of rain is expected in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect on Friday when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and were predicted to set a flood record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flood of Ascension County on the river below is a threat when the flooding rivers slowly descend into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, was at the highest level ever on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
The rescuers are still picking people out of the floodwaters in the counties of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were near Gloster on Friday.
62-year-old Hansford says that the water of Beaver Creek, normally more than 400 feet from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He says he was warned by another stepson who lived nearby.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford’s wife told her husband that she has not seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have all the injuries and that he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that the rescue workers rescued the trio in a large army-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued people spent the night on Friday.
Mr Krautmann says that the floods "swim rapidly" as heavy rains continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that an eyewitness near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Mr Krautmann said that the country had been completely saturated with heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to the rescue of Tangipaho County residents from their homes and to the cancellation of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
CBS’ subsidiary WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipahosa said that 200 homes were flooded.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
The district chairman, Robby Miller, said that the authorities rescued 72 people and 7 pets who had been surrounded by high tides.
shelters have been opened in the cities of Amite and Hammond for those who have been evacuated.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to go down," he said.
In the town of Hammond in Tangipaho County, about 20 streets were closed because of the tide, and the inhabitants were allowed to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, city administrator.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, the emergency director of Harrison County, Rupert Lacy, said that the flat rain continued along the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have flooded, but so far, so far, no cases of flooding have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain is still on."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown, who was full of bullets, survives the shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
Her grandparents told CBS Philadelphia her name was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded critically and has undergone several surgeries.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Scientists tell CBS Philadelphia it looks like there was a crossfire between several shooters.
The attack weapon - type shells that come from various weapons of attack filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a continuing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
"It appears that there were several armed fighters here and that they were in active combat," said Anthony Ginaldi, Philadelphia police chief.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the intel, the police are investigating the surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old girl was hit by a stray bullet in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, from America.
It has also established the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
The most successful female gymnast in the last four years has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America was cheering.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who perform unexpected but masterly gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has consistently won individual gold in women’s plurality.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the peak of the species, but this is not what the situation looks like in gymnastics halls across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five), because at the next Olympics there will be only four gymnasts, and this will be Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts practice mostly in private gymnasiums run by parents who pay for training, premises, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts as well as for families) and the list continues.
A large part of these gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous suburban neighbourhoods that can support the species.
In these clubs, gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long - term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Aimee Boomman, Simone Bales coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez coach, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should bring more affordable and available gymnastics training to communities where many young girls are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem to over 15 000 urban youths (mainly blacks and Latins) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this major Olympic sport.
Gymnasts develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination offers life-long benefits for good health, school and work success.
This team inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're living in an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
Medical interns organizing new strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the changes in the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37 000 doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed the plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was on "unknown ground", and that even minor additional delays are damaging staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement that will include changes in night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Medical Trainee Committee, said last night in an opinion: "Doctor trainees still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it will accelerate the existing labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors equally."
When only eight weeks remain before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been faced by the government’s unwillingness to participate and at times with deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the coercion, and take into account the concerns of the interns.
If he doesn't, the doctors will be ready to continue the fight.
The latest strike at the end of April meant the postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception hours when nurses and consultants were recruited to replace doctors in the strike watch.
Ministers had hoped to put an end to the changes in the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association staff.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 doctors under contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of the NHS Employers Association, appealed to medical interns not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles achieve little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a difficult situation, causing anxiety, anxiety and disruption to patients, care providers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardian Role) and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continued positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for returnees on sabbatical leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay differences in medicine - will be a sign of the seriousness of the compliance with the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May by employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health.
A two - pound - per - day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a two - pound - a - day drug after the authorities recommended that it be given longer to people.
Ticagrelor, an anticoagulant medicine, reduces the risk of relapses in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE, the NHS supervisor, has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people each year have a heart attack in England, and a quarter of these have a second seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by fatty material that accumulates in the wall of the artery, which forms narrowings.
If the narrowing is ruptured, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation of blood into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks loose, it can travel with the blood and cut the circulation of blood into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca, sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clotting less likely.
The draft NICE guidelines published today recommend that humans receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months followed by 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Without concern for the availability of effective preventive treatments, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the person.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation for ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available treatment options to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly with regard to the risk of bleeding - are limited for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment for longer than this period.
A culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim regions
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed last year for corruption, giving impetus to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the widespread rejection of voting fraud in Muslim communities, which is exposed today in a shocking government report.
Sir Eric Pickles, former government minister, is bludgeoning the police, election officials and city councils for ignoring the evidence of electoral fraud because of the 'racial and religious hypersensitivity'.
The former secretary of the community, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so serious that the police should be allowed to set up watch chains to protect those who were frightened outside the polling stations.
He recommends that voters should present an identity card when they vote to prove who they are.
Today, the only thing the voters need to say is their name and address.
The report even proposes that the voter’s finger should be put on incorruptible ink so that no one can vote twice.
The whistleblowers should be better protected," says Sir Eric.
He calls for greater access for the press to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but would protect local government from a culture of corruption and economic fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud," he said.
The government commissioned a report following the vote scandal in Tower Hamlets, East London.
Last year the Special Electoral Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be suspended as a result of numerous allegations of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 's cynically distorted' the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics' accusations of racism and Islamism.
Rahman is said to have led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
As many as 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person’s vote by someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the election fraud vote by post, where it was said that high-ranking members of the Muslim community pressured people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including the identification of identity by ID.
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the wishes of the elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There were concerns that...the institutions of the state had ignored such behaviour because of 'politically correct' racial and religious hypersensitivity."
Mr Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists to deal with the ballots received by post in order to put an end to the 'collection of votes'.
The report that Theresa May is considering also calls for stricter checks on registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider the options for proving the identity of the voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person who votes for the incorruptible ink so that no one can vote twice.
Run systematic nationality checks to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prevent political activists from processing ready-made mail votes and envelopes in which votes are sent.
Let the police set up watch chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to accuse people of intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photography illegal at polling stations.
Require that only English is used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen the training to ensure that the staff adhere to the rule that the voters should go to the booth alone.
Sir Eric is going to kill the police force in Greater London, saying it's "surprising" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court stayed as a result of the numerous corruption and illegal activities of Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty without suspicion on the basis of a number of grounds, according to the criminal evidence threshold.
He also criticised the inefficient 'cross-checks' in the voting offices of the city councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's Tower Hamlets verdict was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy of giving birth to parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of electoral fraud and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy about Kate's bicyclist double and other celebrity shows at the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have lost sight of French cyclists Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who have been proven to be the impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can brag about his own famous double, at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, has caused a storm on Twitter since his pictures came up, where he looks scary like the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the passion of social media, the archer admitted that he had heard since childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, except maybe with a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly emerge also this year: the striking resemblance between Britain’s tall jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina has been said to be the double of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
Bigger gear for the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sportal version" of the Inception actor
Another long-term comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similar strong eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova also has the same actor Annalynne McCord as tanned skin and blond hair, while the US team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share the same face form and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities
A Twitter user recently expressed its happiness on the site that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the American football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, and the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful broad smile matches the smile of star Bring It On Gabrielle Union.
The CBC Olympic Commentator apologizes for saying "dead as a pig" to a Chinese swimmer.
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s 4x200-metre free-swimming message enraged CBC’s direct Olympic broadcast viewers on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the race that a 14-year-old Chinese female swimman "disappeared like a bad smell" and "dead as a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the Women's 4x200-metre freestyle message final.
MacDonald, who came to the CBC reporting team to bring "color," was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch China.
Viewers across Canada react quickly online after being shocked by the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC commentator just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer 'died like a pig'??
The idiot didn't realize he was still live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the Women's Free Swim 4 x 200 metres final: "That little 14-year-old from China screwed up, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald on Twitter was heavy and fast, with many challenging him.
Twitter users didn't hold themselves back when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist gang.
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who was hosting a CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald’s comment, saying: “We regret that the comment on the swimming performance was broadcast.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this has happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to a comment.
I had to apologize on behalf of Mr. MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and linked an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and sent live.
Last night we took action quickly and apologized on live television to our viewers and our followers on social media.
For the sake of clarity, it has to be said that Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to define his comment by saying that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize in the moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message," he said in the CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of a swimmer, not to him as a person."
"It's unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it to be disrespectful and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client dismayed by a woman who insolently tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know where to watch a woman undress in the middle of Primark's shop to try underpants.
Things didn’t improve because after assessing what he looked like in his pants, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to go around and finally tried on four pairs of underpants in a shop located at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's shop at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on panties and then put them back on the shelf
At the same time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children in the store, said that after experimenting with underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of panties on display, took off her own pantyhose and underwear, and put on her adaptable feet.
"He didn't even try to find a secluded place for atonement, he just stood there shamelessly."
"Everybody was staring when he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before finally deciding that he didn’t like anything he saw, dressed up again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who was watching or thinking about someone who would end up buying the underwear he was trying on."
Davidson, 33 years old in Kent City, said: "It is disgusting to think that someone takes home underwear that someone else has tried but has not been cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove the items of clothing from the sale after the woman left, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off, and they have not been washed."
The representative of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in Folkestone's shop on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been withdrawn from the market."
This way you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Krav Maga Federation’s Grand Master Rhon Mizrach in New York to find out how to handle gun - waving robbers in close proximity.
Whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how you can pay the attacker the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're approached from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and you're gonna "clear the line of fire."
Then you grab the gun between the forearm and the shoulder before hitting the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Continue with the knee to the groin, and when the attacker goes from pain to tipper, twist the gun from his hands, hit him at the back of the gun in the face, and back off with the gun pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time put some weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult to you?
Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's Grand Master, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe for a tour guide
The British traveler has posed a serious challenge to his immune system and vomit reflex by licking some of Europe’s dirtiest and grossest places.
Suffolk’s host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, handrail Piccadilly Circus, train toilet flush button and Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each target, he used a photometer to show himself and us the situation he was about to encounter.
However, the experiment, which was made in a film called Internal Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people may seem totally repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him with anything else in the mouth of evil taste.
Wright became known as a test of the endurance of his bowels as he traveled around the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, from the public rail rail rails to the toilet seat’s flushing button, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said: "Since childhood, I have been quite careless about my health, and I have put in my mouth all sorts of things from soil, worms and muddy water."
He certainly confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was the filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometric reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison purposes, the number of newly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public latrine he refused to lick when the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the newly washed hands were less than 60.
Wright has produced a film by a traveler, an internal force, together with a Finnish dairy, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything 'cause it's disgusting in here.
On the trail of internal strength was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gephilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to enhance the efficiency of human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the leader of Valio's snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer our consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to watch, and which would at the same time explain the probiotic interests.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea of "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary is an interesting way to tell consumers more about it.
I also think the documentary shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Document director Tom Hakala added: "Let's just say this: if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the disgusting Russian toilet in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the lickings were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we managed to record some of those dirty licks."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% said that at least occasionally they use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
The bully family destroyed a rental house in Saltashi, Cornwall, before eviction.
After being evicted for the terror of their neighbours, the bulldozer family caused 50 000 pounds of damage to their rented house.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints.
After being forcefully removed from the property, shocked housing workers found the property to be in bad condition.
There were gaping openings in the walls, the floorboards were torn down, the garbage was placed on the floor, and the walls were graffitied.
The family has now moved away, and they are believed to live in private accommodations.
Conna McEvoy, the manager of Cornwall Housing, said she's afraid the property won't be fixed.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I do not think that people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of issues to consider here, since this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups in Cornwall.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious."
The couple had three sons who lived in the property once in a while, and according to the police, the family’s tyranny involved street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of loved ones, drug abuse, drug sales, and excessive shouting, fighting and swearing.
In June, 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was on the lease agreement, received a decision on anti-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the threat of demolition found old waste.
The floorboards of the property, from which drugs were previously supplied, had been pulled up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing forcefully evicted a woman and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, to move voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors commended the eviction, saying that their lives had become a hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet in here, we're not used to it!
I love it now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, executive director of Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property.
Garbage and old toys have been thrown down on the crazy wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own and his family's conduct, for eviction is always the last course of action considered by Cornwall Housing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and the courageous members of the community who have informed us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send out a message that anti-social behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one bedroom after the eviction
The housing company employees must now clean up the waste stacks around the house
In 2014, the police raided the property and found over 70 g of cannabis as well as scales, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined for admitting his guilt to possession of a class B drug as an intention to distribute it further.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skeldon's tombstone, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her associates live after being homeless now in private accommodation in Plymouth.
There were graffiti on many walls of the rooms in the house.
The police say that they are trying to evict residents who are mocking the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall police said that eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such conduct," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew low on the beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew by from a very low altitude
The Air Force said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At this very moment, terrified tourists began to panic when a low - flying jet swept over a crowded beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came almost to touch from sun worshippers on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noise of the jet, even though they did not at first see what was coming at them behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who released videos of a dramatic missover on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed twice very low, and at one point it seemed as if it was going down."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared out of the darkness and flew incredibly low.
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown much lower than usual because of the poor visibility of smoke from nearby fires, but the Air Force assured us that no one was in danger.
In addition to destroying parts of mainland Portugal this summer, four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today said that the pilot had to fly in low visibility due to conditions, smoke caused by fires and thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Results for the first half of the year better than expected
In January - June, the South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made a better result of EUR 3.4 million than planned.
Eksote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where institutional care has been dismantled by developing preventive services.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, the exote is trying to shorten the queues of measures.
Exote covers the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The excess may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The result for the whole year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Executive Board will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special linemen took a military oath at Immola.
The 70 garrisons of the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
A military oath was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth special class of Rangers was held at the garrison’s sports field.
The military oath was taken by 70 garrisonmen.
Special border rangers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied for a special borderer.
Two hundred and fifty were invited to the exams.
Special border icers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the wartime border forces were involved in the meeting in connection with the ceremony.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who attended the event were born in 1918.
A little bit ahead of the bandit - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 Finnish police departments has been operating the RTA, a criminal intelligence and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is invisible from the outside.
At the Häme police department, the unit consists of a total of four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
Chief of Staff is a lieutenant in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to the rest of the police.
Among other things, it has acquired information about asylum seekers in the turbulent.
The most recent reform of working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would not leave the place of the swamps until they received the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit is used to target day-to-day police activity where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was set up in the country, less than three national units and a criminal intelligence unit was set up in each police department.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the Central Crime Police, manages operations on a national basis.
PTR units work according to their name from the police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, on the other hand, work in shared areas according to the police services and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond your area
While the individual police are aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
With the help of registers, alarm function database and observations, the unit aims to draw the police’s attention to new phenomena, productive criminal offences or similar crimes.
This is called seriesing and is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the unsub is created into a certain image.
Serials can be done on the basis of either the method of action or the person, depending on who the police have more information about.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not walk around the city with their collars up, but their work is not entirely public either.
There is no mention of methods both of their own and of those used by criminals, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent criminal attempts by the police.
The police will tell the public about the methods if it anticipates that they pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, news in early summer, the method used in housebreakings to mark empty dwellings.
In it the perpetrators put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really out of town.
The preparatory investigation material shall be made public at least to the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals are learning from the mistakes they have made.
The clever ones order the district court minutes, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves on.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Seppä from the Häme police department, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland police department, Detective Commissioner Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu police station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information that is used to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was a three-step PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the boundaries of the institution and Finland.
Father-related schoolgirl from London killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is rumored to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee said that her family heard that she died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have died in a Russian air raid on Raqqa, an organization base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of this case is that it can serve as a tombstone and a will for others, that there are real risks of going into a war zone - that it could cause people to give up making such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family were told that she had married an Isis fighter in Syria and that she became a widow only a few months later.
Reid says Clinton will hold Garland as a candidate for Supreme Court if he is elected.
The Senate's Democratic Director, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the Democratic President-designate, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
The president of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says that the next president will replace the late Supreme Court member Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, in a conference call, Reid said that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland with some degree of certainty.
Reid’s representative later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "crush the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who stand in the way of Garland's appointment are the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "knuckles" and "opportunities".
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says that the naked calendar is for "women as well as men"
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are going to find the next generation of top models in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The chairman of the treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine, rich in nude pictures, differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them too.
"We have to start showing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked female body," said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personal open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl Destination: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you rush into filling the comment section with irritable insults with a nickname NoAll LonelyMedium-age Men, note that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-speaked new appearance of records is not because more and more of those born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the longing for middle life.
Apparently, those who recently bought vinyl discs are most likely between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the most unlikely ones to buy records are those of the 18-24 age group.
Nor is it just a matter of collecting enthusiasts, but it involves emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk through a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I would be suffocating before I stop, forming a cup of my hands and saying something authoritative, such as, "Let's look into it."
Let us look into this further.
While Soho's charm and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops and office supplies are now filling buildings with independent movements - a handful of great specialized record stores still exist.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, as I stand very close to the various men in some of these stores as I try to evaluate their age and emotional temperament.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, followed by Sister Ray (a counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (a counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and goes around shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I guess I am," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, which appear in the picture above (he sent a sample by e-mail, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for acquiring such a huge number of records and singles is partly the result of his disposable income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published and he can buy again those he sold when he was young and broke.
"Most of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when there were 11 or 12, records I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my vice."
Twenty-five-year-old Wez, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he encounters fit the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the albums have come back into fashion and have come to need to buy back their old albums.
From the discussions I have had, people have been getting rid of their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl awakened at a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of the records?
It takes a few seconds for a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comforting community for like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly injured by the local payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be overwhelmed by the digital world and choose to rely on the stability of familiar disk covers; objects that evoke the memories of teenage happy days.
"I think that sometimes it can be about filling a hole or some kind of comfort, which is created by the possession of objects," Wez says.
As a collector, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another employee suddenly said from the record pile.
A April opinion poll carried out by the ICM revealed that almost 50% of the people who had bought the vinyl disc in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would likely appear to be seriously concerned when I look at the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "prize" aspect of the wake-up call is something that Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (numerator: three middle-aged men) has also noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy Radiohead's record so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a great deal, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
The top, which now has almost a full layer of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned movements, it is great to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to prove the gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes, looking at various records for sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me he doesn't make a lot of money, so record collecting isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." she sighs in love.
"I don't know how to explain... "it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to look like I'm looking at jeans, I'm picking up a group of teenage girls who gather around Polaroid cameras for a while before my father and daughter think about buying Crosley's record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essentials of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "art vinyl."
But considering that even the slightest attention given to these items can mean more money for industry and send some customers to Soho’s pitfalls to get more, there is little to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the proportion of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as vinyls.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or at an office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning snooping around the Berwick Street record stores browsing records and avoiding the look of a creepy, 30-year-old fake TV host looking over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holker is the longest living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists say that the Holker has a longer life span than any other vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied the shark, says that the record is on a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
The French court rejects the application to dissolve the shops in Jungle refugee camp
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to dismantle dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in Jungle’s camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At the hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to dismantle 72 temporary trades where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the sites should be dismantled because they represent a tax-free parallel economy and because they represent a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that free meals provided by a government-supported organization and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
The Court of Justice in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for eviction of people who ran 72 temporary trades, but said that Calais' prefect's concern "was perfectly understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than just feeding people "in the most uncertain circumstances".
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the threat of demolition was Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advisers for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
Over 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's café.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing a café would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle's camp has risen to 9,000 people - top of the list - since the arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
Food prices fall significantly faster in Finland than the EU average
Food in Finland is falling sharply to the delight of consumers and to the annoyance of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost five per cent in three years, while in the EU countries, on average, it fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become more expensive than 1%.
During the last three years, the price of food has fallen in Finland to the second highest in those EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
In the United Kingdom alone, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
These data derive from the article by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of Development of Statistics Finland, published in the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices rose close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage of EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then came the turn, after which the food has become cheaper each year.
The price is now being weighed down by the Russian import bans on food, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in prices.
Large retail chains The S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has appeared in spectacular advertising campaigns.
However, Finland is still not a place of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen considerably.
In 2015, food in Finland was the fourth most expensive EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the control countries had the same rate of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with the same level of pay.
Lehtinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutchmen would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries in terms of food prices, VAT must be halved to the EU average and the price competition will continue," says Lehtinen.
The newspaper points out that his calculations at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School isn't exactly the same anymore.
A person returning to the school bench may find that a change has taken place in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced in all primary schools at the beginning of the semester.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan indicates the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old ones in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned and, instead, the practice of coding begins in schools.
Swedish education will begin in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies will start already in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This is how you try to make school more interesting.
The world's longest-lived vertebrate found - an ice shark can live for up to 400 years
Even Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach maturity until the age of 150.
It can live after that for another 250 years, reporting a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-lived vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is passed by only by the Icelandic mussel, whose oldest known individual is dated to 507.
Greenland sharks are swimming all over the North Atlantic.
They also have a second record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch longer than dogs, can grow up to more than five meters [5 m] long.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about one centimeter a year is followed, adult individuals have been forced to live for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined adult ice sharks from the age of 28 females caught in fishermen’s traps.
The age of the fish was revealed in the radiocarbon dating of the eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 cents Amazonine fins, were revealed to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that the glacial females reach maturity at more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people - no less sellers.
Almost 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann, a department store company.
Co-operative companies in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be carried out as redundancies", Stockmann explains in his press release.
It states that the number of suppliers in the department stores will not be reduced in order to avoid the loss of customer service.
In addition, about 80 support workers are offered new jobs as sellers.
Stockmann's negotiations concerned approximately 3 000 employees.
At the time of their start, the reduction was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction aims to achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in obtaining a profit from the department store are in the background.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the trade in department stores is still losing.
According to the acting CEO of Stockmann, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in the department stores have not met the company’s objectives.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018, says Veijalainen in the press release.
The result improvement of the second quarter was based in particular on the success of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best second quarter net sales and results of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year the entire Stockmann Group’s operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north... temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure center on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says Ilona Láng, meteorologist at HS.
There are showers also in the central parts of the earth, but there is a crouton southward.
The temperature is no longer very summer, since the whole country is below 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20 ° C].
In the rainy areas of the north, they remain at 10 to 15 degrees.
Kenya’s athletic team is shaken by the doping scandal — a strange explanation for the coach’s stunt
Kenyan athletic coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah was an athlete on the national team in a doping test.
The news agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star, Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, head of Kenya’s national team, reported that Anzrah’s identity was revealed after giving a sample of Rotichina in a surprise test.
Doping officers went to report Anzrah to the authorities.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he "made his crimes against the Kenyan national team".
He performed as an athlete, gave me a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour", the chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, Mr Kip Miele, thundered on the news agency Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Last year, Rotich was fourth in the World Cup and is one of Rio's favourite winners.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan athletic team claimed that Anzrah was using an athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the competition village.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officers because he was afraid they'd find out," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio’s Athletic Stadium Is Treading Out of emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium watching athletics.
On Friday in Rio, the battle for athletic medals began, but the world’s top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a bafflingly empty audience.
On Friday, Rio organizers reported that only 58 percent of the first - day tickets and 65 percent of the tickets have been sold.
Another was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheering crowds.
The final tickets are already sold out in Rio.
Even before athletics, Rio’s Olympic spectator loss has attracted attention.
For example, there have been thousands of empty benches in the stands of rugby, canoeing and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medal hopes in Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in legendary Copacabana, only 70 percent of the audience was full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 percent of the audience of 12 000 were still full.
The bad news is explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from being a European and Asian competition tourist, and many Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians who are used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not fill the football stadium.
During the weekend Mario Andrada, spokesperson for the race organizers, reported that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million to sell," Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold at the London Olympic Games, 8.2 million were sold, even though the tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty spaces, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed, because the organisers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organisers have given 240 000 tickets to less well-known species such as golf and rugby for schoolchildren in the country.
Rio Stadium had a lot of empty seats this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba's sand hasn't interested the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There was a lot of people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
Private, business and community can then cash in the holder rights to the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area in Lapland.
The land is virtually divided into blocks that can be acquired by those who wish to acquire the right to bear the right to payment.
The holder is entitled to veto a parcel of 187 square metres, which in practice means that not every holder is required to be approved if the use of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
The acquisition of the right to rule is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go carrying banners or chain yourself to something to protect nature," explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
A person who acquires the right to administration receives precise location information from his or her block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
Names of holders who have acquired rights on the Foundation's website are displayed on the same map where the land block information can be found.
Leviakangas sees only the risk of the Foundation’s activities changing from its original idea.
Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some way unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The main idea of the Helsinki Foundation’s Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can remain untouched and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land by buying or donating land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland’s borders and plans to purchase land from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop-up forest at Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turkey most of the big cities - see the situation in your municipality
Bicycle thieves torment Turkey most of the large cities of Finland.
This year more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine largest cities.
Helsingin Sanomat explained to the police the number of bicycles stolen in the ten largest cities in January to August of this year and their parts per 1000 inhabitants.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti took the lead.
According to police records, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, on the other hand, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police.
It's a big difference.
"In other cities, twice the number of thefts is made in proportion to the number of residents," says Tommi Reen, Police Inspector of the Police Department.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The frequency of thefts can be influenced by the amount of bikes in the city and how many wheels there are," says Sergeant Teemu Mäkäs.
Tommi Reen of the National Police Board expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts goes largely according to what are study and cycling cities.
Turku has a dense centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city where city centres are remote from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of mobility," says Reen.
In the whole of Finland, slightly fewer bicycle thefts have been reported to the police in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police report little more than 20 000 bicycle thefts per year.
It means 50-60 bikes every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're in large quantities," says Reen.
In reality, thieves take more bikes, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a bicycle theft, even though fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police find out.
A typical solved bicycle theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in the blood.
"Even in other investigations, cases can also be identified when, for example, stolen wheels may be found in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with the police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bikes are stolen, for example, from shopping center bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars, in practice wherever they are usually stored.
As in previous years, Jopo are the most important ones stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the wheel for short - term use, for example, but a large proportion of stolen wheels end up on the Internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least it has not become known to the police that stolen wheels would go abroad much," says Reen.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about that.
The buyer of the used bike must be vigilant, as he may be guilty of concealment or violation.
"The alarm clocks should ring if the bike is sold in good condition at a clear price," says Reen.
Severi Hirvi, a special librarian, carries his colorful fasts to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki during his working day.
He's had five wheels, but none of them have been stolen, Moose says. "No one's ever been taken, so there's been a good monk."
"Perhaps this does not attract thieves, it may not even have hipster value," says Helsinginen Hirvi.
Siiri Valve, who was in the Helsinki Kallio kiosk, quickly locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike swung against the wall of the kiosk, but Valve usually locks his bike in something solid, such as a wheel rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have," says Helsinki student about his white bike, whose frame alone cost about 500 euros.
"All the time, you hear from your friends that you've been taking your bikes."
"Most of the bad bikes, those booger Jopos."
A bicycle was stolen from the courtyard of the building company from the wake itself a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve was expecting it to be taken.
You're under the age of 15 to be held responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer jurys familiar with the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from being caught in a spiral of crime.
Initially, the experiment will apply to those under 15 years of age who are now deprived of criminal liability.
A peer jury is involved in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender can himself join the peer jury to make up for what he did.
Other consequences may include a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, director of youth services, says that the model is not strict.
We have other forms of mediation that are used side by side.
"In all cases, the actions of a young person are directed in a more responsible direction so that everything does not get ruined from the first mistake," Laitio says.
Peer jurorship has been inspired by the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflexes what happened with about the same age group.
We've tried the model once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio, who followed the experiment, says that this was an assault that was successfully solved.
The first crimes, especially those under the age of 15, may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen," Lovio says.
The Peer Jury is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Ms Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all young people who need them, not just those who need them.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump's campaign
Over 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received a draft.
According to the paper, an open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump and his indifference, incompetence and record disfavor threaten to bring the democrats a landslide in these elections," says Politico.
Only by directing all possible funds to the Congressional elections can the Republicans be prevented from drowning with a Trump-enriched anchor around their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is scheduled to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is prominently opposed to Trump by Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from 'people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress' and that it is not a question of supporting anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump that are believed to have injured millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they did not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton outlined the details of her economic policy on Thursday evening.
I'm running for president to make the American economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive, 275 billion-dollar five-year programme to improve US infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly by private money.
The construction program is a hand-out for the American workers who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in high-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the builders' people, we must go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders anyway when he stressed that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the tax of departure," Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to a free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he used to support.
"[As President] I am opposed to any trade agreements that are against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial programme announced by Republicans Donald Trump on Monday for ‘only favoring millionaires of this kind’.
Mr Trump's proposed discount on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of small entrepreneurs whose bills Trump has not paid and of the clothes Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America," Clinton pricked.
These are Rio’s ratings: The competitions have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Sports games are usually seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached a great number of spectators.
At one time, the competitions have glued to the screens at best 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615 000 spectators from Yle's Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Championships for athletics one month ago attracted nearly 800 000 spectators to TV2 at a time, and the European Championships for football amounted to well over one million.
For the time being, the most interested in Olympic sports has been cycling on Sunday evening and the fifth day of the competition opened up stage gymnastics, both of which reached nearly half a million spectators at a time.
Panu Pokkinen, Chief of Yle Sport, is pleased with the ratings and reminds us that the spectators are divided into several instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We welcome the fact that a large proportion of TV viewers choose the Olympic Games at all.
Even on the television side, the viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympic Games are the first sports competition for which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day and the viewers continue to be from 20,000 to 500 000, that is a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - much of Rio’s race shows come in Finland at night.
Another reason for a weak interest - if someone now thinks it is weak - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are only just beginning, as are other sports of Finnish interest: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the ratings at the beginning have been close to what was expected.
When athletics begin, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which became the most downloadable free app in Finland during the first days of the games in Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app was loaded 150 000 times.
I'm guessing we're already going around 200,000 downloads.
"We won't get network ratings until later." Pokkinen says.
Rio Arena has not been operating on all users as hoped.
Mr Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the faults have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
An updated version of the apps has been obtained that should correct the errors.
Rio Olympic Games are visible on Yle’s channels and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
You can follow some species from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Speech transmits games every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle's channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, whose depth is 95.3 metres on the back of the cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical dive instructor, found a 20-square-metre impression on the back of the cross, the bottom of which looked 104 meters deep.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation in vain by collecting echoes.
The method may not find a small depth in 100 meters," says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So for the time being, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi extend to more than 80 metres.
They have not been studied as closely as Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be some unknown depths," Kannela says.
If the deepest lake is defined by the middle depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
Viewed this way Päijänne does not reach the ten deepest groups and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction on August 12th at 2:29 p.m.: Corrected last paragraph where the deepest lakes were wrong.
I admire the tax rate: Pensioners' taxation is still tighter
The taxation of pensioners is still stricter than that of employees.
An Ihalainen says that the problem was raised in the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
This is not what the government's proposal contains.
We believe that this should definitely be the case.
The promises made should be followed after the elections," he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
It heated up in the parliament the opposition representatives, who grilled Alexander Stubb, then finance minister, about election promises.
Buying power is secured, it won't grow.
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (C.E.), tax reductions are mainly about securing purchasing power rather than increasing, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä's (central) and Orpo's willingness to respect the hard-earned competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be destroyed by questioning them.
This will be necessary because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Addressing prolonged unemployment in the row
An Ihalan appeals to the government to tackle long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to halt its growth.
The number of long-term unemployed was around 17,000 higher in June than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government’s goal of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish casualties in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people were killed in the bombings of Finnish time.
The embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists going to Thailand to cancel their trip due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions on caution are worth following," Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travelling season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out especially to Finns in Hua Hin for information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine," Westphalen says.
No record of the author.
Westphalen says there's no record of who did the attacks yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of the divided Thai society and last week's referendum on the military junta's constitution.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people in the country who declared their opposition to the law were arrested.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict involving the Muslim population arises, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very limited.
The attacks should affect the day’s course in such a way that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died in 24 hours, when 11 bombs have exploded in various parts of the country, such as Phuket and Hua Hin, popular with tourists.
Even in a tourist destination popular by Finns, the holiday island Phuket had four bombs detonated at night, reports Bangkok Post, a Thai newspaper.
According to current data, they did not require any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have been detonated in Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, yesterday and today.
At least one person was killed in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb was detonated in the village of Surat Than and Trang.
At least one person was killed in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the resort islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
Unknown attacker
According to the leader of the military junta in Thailand, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not foment people to panic any further," he said to journalists.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trangi are linked.
He said to Thai BSB that the aim of the perpetrators was to destroy the country's tourism, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finns intending to cancel their journey due to explosions, but it is worth following the advice of the great ingenuity about caution," Westphalen says.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known so far about the attacks and their victims during the night in Finland.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has given us a little more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian are among the wounded.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second attack.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of a clock tower known as a sight.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
According to the governor of the province, the Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bed.
A municipal employee was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The Chief of Police interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in Surat Than’s attack, which exploded every 30 minutes or so.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
United States Biles won the women's quadruple
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was the second with 60,098 points and the third with 58,665 points as Alija Mustafina of Russia.
Biles, 18, is still in the Rio Games for stage championships at permanence, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the full in recent years.
He's got eight personal world championships in the last three seasons.
He has won the four-game and permanence championships three times in a row as well as the boom in the past and the year before.
In the US team, Partys has won two World Championships.
The party's got a jump and a boom.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs the real estate office in Phuket Thailand and the children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the attacks on tourism in Thailand.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think there will be anything more amazing, Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for some 20 years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many tragedies that have affected Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these former ones have not banished tourists, this is hardly the case either.
The office of Huovila company is located a few hundred metres from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called around 9:00 local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on because of the queen's birthday," Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
Patong had a calm atmosphere and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach haven't even heard of the attacks.
At half past half past three days in Thailand time at Patong the traffic had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who was at the scene of the attack.
Later, the car was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men matching the description hidden in a nearby spruce tree.
The other man was immediately apprehended.
One ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft of the use of a motor vehicle, theft and aggravated damage.
The police are grateful to those who tipped us off.
Research Director of Russia's leadership changes: Clear secession
On Friday, Russia made the highest-ranking change in its leadership in years when President Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-based 44-year-old Anton Persecution.
He's an ex-diplomat. He's a second-in-command of Ivanov.
Kangaspuro says that the reason why Ivanov was disfellowshipped may be that Putin wanted to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling executives is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up independent authority for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in conflict with other leaders or has screwed up.
Drop-off to Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, is taking on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
Mr Putin, on a tape presented by the national media, said that the amendment was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to another position and suggested that the persecution be replaced, said Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov it is a clear drop in the station.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union at the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov’s place that Putin replaces his loved ones with younger ones.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to escape to the city of Jarabulus so that we wouldn't aim at them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were stationed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the important city of Manbij to ISIS.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists were left in the city.
Corrected prior news at 7:30: Earlier, we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians as they fled the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s policy on public access to documents is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on public access to documents is illegal," says Professor Tomi Vouti from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
Previously, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the list of participants in the Home Secretary's events to the Evening Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision with instructions from the Prime Minister's Office and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communication of the Ministry says to the STT that the need to reform practices has been recognised in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio.
Like in the last few years, Bolt has run against time under a high-ranking race.
In the early years, he insulted his backline and had to skip the Olympic trials in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've been practicing well, and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low - fashioned samba dancers and fans.
Porina Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in the era of athletics struggling with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt’s previous defeat at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he was cut out in the 200-metre primers at 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters [100 m] in which he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors despite the final celebration at the time of 9.69.
This is gonna be harder.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career with a clock.
World records of 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a world record of 200 meters and a 19 - second low, but no one believes in it but Bolt himself.
For a hundred dollars, Bolt’s toughest challenger is Justin Gatlin, the 100th Olympic winner of Athens 2004.
Last year, at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not lost a single time in the finals of the Valuable Games if he has been on his way.
In Daegu, 2011 the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to a fraudulent departure.
Bolt turns 30 in just over a week.
He's an old man in a young man's sport, and Rio's races are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final finish line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustraded.
Exposures from Rio: two athletes suspected of drug abuse
According to Xinhua, China’s state news agency, Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin's doping sample found traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of a doping offence.
In addition, a Kenyan athletic coach was sent home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
He finished fourth in Rio in a women's 100-metre butterfly swim.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has brought his case of doping before the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xinyin Sunday showed signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspicions of doping have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reports that Bulgarian female barrier runner Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of epo-hormones.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletic coach from Rio to his home because of a drug offence.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee, KOK, reported that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to the media, this is John Anzrah, a Kenyan express coach.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used a race pass from Ferguson Rotich, a 800-meter runner.
Phelps will not be stopped - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, in the United States, swam his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio during the 200 - meter season.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same type of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
The Japanese Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before the Chinese Wang Shuni.
I'm just trying to have some fun, and the BBC Olympic swim commentator, Helen Skelton, is laughing at the quick interview in Evening Magazine.
The article on Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on the evening magazine website this week.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton won't be under much stress if there's a little noise in social media or in the British press about his revealing and unusual outfits.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high heels and a short dress with at least enough exposure to the eyes of at least many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no further steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and small noises are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton would like to impress you and perhaps startle you, but he insists that he doesn't want to play the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus has to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the noise has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that points to how hard these swimmers work and how much sacrifice they make is okay with me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It is a touch of nothing if it comes from (the host) dressing.
I'm a little bit amused if one of these has hit someone's radar.
Rio PD made two arrests on suspicion of terrorism.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that they have arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with the security of the Games.
In this connection, the police made five other arrests and interrogated two individuals before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 News site, persons arrested for terrorism belong to the same group as those arrested by the police in July.
The detainees are believed to have ties to the Isis Association.
The arrests were reportedly instigating violence in the social media.
Messages about violence had been distributed, among others, in the popular WhatsApp service.
Eighty-five thousand police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blew up a suspicious package in Rio.
Spain and Nigeria had to start their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty hangar on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place down to the public.
The police let the audience in after they had controlled the explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have performed a controlled blasting mission.
The police closed the arena because of the suspicious package they found there.
The crowd got in after the police had controlled the package.
The audience didn't get there by the start of the fight, because the police closed the arena for a while because of the suspicious package found in the hangar.
The police blew up the package and didn't let the audience in until after.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the games drowsy.
With two defeats, Spain won Nigeria by 96-87.
In the last two races, Spain reached silver.
The police already performed a controlled blasting mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
Last time the police had to blow up a suspicious discovery in the vicinity of the roadbiking site last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their match at the beginning of the Rio basketball tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine dame made Petäjä-Siren think about protest
The Wind of the Petter-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The Wind of the Petter-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
Argentinea’s dame made Tuuli Petäjä-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women’s surfing day.
There was a clear break in the wind.
The opponent admitted the offence.
He got stuck because of the accident, and the others ran away," said Joakim Wilenius, Finland’s head coach.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because, according to the Olympic rules, it would have been pointless.
I should have fallen into the water to get compensation," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board to the last, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
During the accident, the Finnishman was left in 27th place.
In total, London’s 2012 Olympic Silver Medal is the eighth.
The car accident on the head didn't have much effect.
It's a big day on Friday when you have to race for departures from 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, the traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 Special things that science says prolong age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some of these are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health so that his or her life grows longer.
At other times, things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to average body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can increase your age.
You don't have to spend all your time getting a can of milk.
The secret of longevity has been sought through many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most bizarre research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to a “reduced risk of death”, especially in the case of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, alcohol is supported by studies that moderate use - from one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one observed that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular dental flossing can extend a person’s life by more than six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter affected man’s life.
A seven-year project was monitored by over 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live when the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection against sexually transmitted diseases has been taken into account, is good for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, physical activity brings additional years, and there is no denying that.
However, reaching longevity does not require absolute solitude.
One Oxford University study found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their system.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality.
Whether it's an athlete or an actor who won an Oscar at the Olympics, he's more likely to live longer than a regular chubby.
Many research efforts have been made to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
On the other hand, some researchers suspect that long life is due to the social status of a person - which, in turn, makes it possible, for example, to seek confessions such as the Nobel Prize.
A survey of shopping behaviour among people aged 65 or over found that the person shopping daily was probably less likely to be a parent.
This is because spinning in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may advance death.
So put your credit card out of your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from Umpa fell into a truck.
On Friday night in Koske in Varsinais-Suomi, a serious truck and passenger car accident occurred.
The accident took place in Koskella, Koskentie and Sorvastontie in the middle of Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that arrived had drifted into the lane at the same time, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck was left in a lane, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car fell into the ditch and then over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 who carried a passenger car was crushed in her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and were transported to the Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The woman's breath test was 2.02 per mil.
He's a suspect in a felony DUI.
The mail sent loose candy to the wrong town.
Salon K-Citymarket's loose candy range was flawed because the mail had delivered part of the load accidentally to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was shopping for candy at the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in bulk confectionery because Posti delivered our load to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Post gets the load delivered!
So if there was no traffic on the lawn, the sign said.
The shopkeeper’s foxy sign relates to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to mowing.
Weed cutting is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly amusing and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the upgrade just blew me away.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention that this has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Elt got her own favorites caught in a candy bag, even though a few tins were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to the Evening Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five pallets strayed yesterday to the wrong place (Seenjoki) and we stopped delivering part-time (Saloon) in three, but only today we took five pallets, Kaidesos told the Evening-Sanos.
The first news item is the Evening Sanomat.
Teija Halt was not indignant at the sign because she found all her own candy favorites in the selection.
Dizziness! 30 kilos lighter Lotta Backlund published a picture of her change
The comedian producer has lost tens of pounds since his baby was born.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of a change in life.
Lotta shared a photo pair on Friday when she moved to Instagram.
In the spring, Lotta was on a physical course and aiming for a normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her dieting work already in 2009.
He has undergone a comprehensive lifestyle change and slowly lost about 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund published a photo pair on Instagram for his spectacular performance.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Before and after Backlund, a pair of pictures have collected several praiseworthy comments from fellow dieters.
You're gorgeous, though.
We're on the same journey, motivation hard!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project.
Your pictures give me a great deal of strength and enthusiasm, as one of them tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos on the "Do It Now" project.
At that time, he told Evening magazine that he wanted to get to the normal weight, which was ten kilos.
During the three months of exercise, five pounds eventually fell.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for the good of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered by donating to the police dog work instead of flowers and petitiones.
Sipoo Veterinarian Station has released a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wishes for donations for the benefit of police dogs.
The article says that the victim had worked in Sipoo Veterinarian Centre as a substitute and had also completed her nursing training there.
The Veterinarian Station remembers a woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and not afraid of work.
A good friend.
Still, we cannot fully understand that he is gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number to which donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that all donations go to police dogs, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lowisian woman was murdered in her own backyard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman’s neighbors have told the Evening Magazine that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man who was suspected of murder didn't know the woman, and they had no connection.
The killer was tracked by a police dog, Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti did not have the right to retain the salary of an employee who refused to teach a temporary agency worker, Kanta-Häme District Court assessed in its judgment.
The District Court ordered Posti to pay the employee most of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have withheld only part of the tutor’s salary, which corresponded to the share of the education in all day’s work.
According to the District Court, the employee was put at a disadvantage under the Non-Discrimination Act on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the PAU's decision on the non-refoulement of the Union of Posts and Logistics.
During last November’s postal strike, PAU decided that Posti’s employees would not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who broke the strike.
The People's News first told us about it.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, writing to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (in the middle) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (p.) in their answer to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (kesk) and Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
Earlier in his letter, the Journalist Federation asked Sipilä and Soini to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin fired the head of his administration, replacing the Estonian-based Persecution.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the Head of the Presidential Administration, Sergei Ivanov, says the Kremlin.
The farm will be attended by Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vain's grandson Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
Persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council," says Interfax, news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
According to the Kremlin's press release, Ivanov, who was part of Putin's tight inner circle, is taking up specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to be transferred to another position and suggested that persecution be replaced, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet era in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed President in 2011 before Putin was re-elected in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant buy-out - can't be seen in the opening of the League of Champions
You don't see the world record man for football transfers on the field when the English League of Champions is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's suspension followed England.
Manchester United’s giant acquisition by Paul Pogba is on the sidelines of ManU’s opening league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, reported BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid the Italian Society Juventus EUR 105 million for Pogba.
However, the British Football Association FA keeps him out of the game, as Juventus was burdened with a ban.
He received two warnings last season at the Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England. The FA told the BBC.
Pogba’s next seam to play is the league’s second round on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, grand madness is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally respected event starred by the world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festars have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is punk legend Iggy Pop this year.
The event area of the Flow Festival is styled with artificial grass and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have just a main stage and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The simple question behind success is: What kind of event would the authors themselves like to go to?
It is quite unusual in the productions of events to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with official regulations, says Tuomas Kallio, artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow was going to sell out again this year.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors of 70,000 in the past year by 5,000.
This year there will be a group of interesting Finnish and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because something has to be financed.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle that is controlled by huge routes.
That's not what we want.
For 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been puffed up with 130 performers, art installations and numerous restaurant points and drinks in a partly artificial grass-based area.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, the concert site this year is a tent of 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little grandiose, but at the same time, we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our case anymore.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, even great visions are practically possible.
During the early 2000s, the operation was highly dependent on the approximately EUR 20 000 of support from the City of Helsinki.
Last year, the turnover of the public limited liability company running Flow amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to create "creise things", such as the construction of that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
In addition to the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled as particularly fashionable.
Above all, we want to stand out with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge group of fans in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival that combines indierock, pop music, rap music and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booed because now is probably the last time we see this on a show in Finland.
We're all interested in history and the future.
It's not just what they play on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's been doing a hell of a lot of good gigs in the last few years.
The bombs from Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots - tourists fled terrified
Two bombs went off in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and over 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street where most of the customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, according to police representative Samoer Yoosumra CNN.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wild animals in Asia, tweeted a talkative picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't show up properly, you can watch it here.
Of those injured in Hua Hin, at least 11 were foreign tourists.
People ran up against me and said the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish touristist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon thereafter, two bombs were detonated on Phuket Island, which was popular with Finns.
No one was reported to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one dead and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in Trangi City.
Police reported that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings who are not satisfied with the efforts of the Thai military leadership.
According to estimates by local authorities, criminal organisations may also be involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently seized on the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new troops will go to battle first in the event of war
In an acute war situation, soldiers are not ordered to battle until several months after taking a military oath, says the Keskisuomalainen.
According to the Chief Education Officer of the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, for example, of military personnel serving 5.5 months in the event of war, only those who are in the final stages of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the training manager, the first task is to recruit reserve personnel from the emergency teams.
No garrison or reserver is ordered to perform a task for which the required training has not been provided, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training military personnel for immediate preparedness units from next year.
If necessary, units can be used in military operations even during military training.
Pamela Tola's got a huge payoff for the mold house.
The actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a heavy dispute over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The price of a two-storey detached house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious problem with moisture was discovered in the house, causing a harmful microbial growth for health.
The couple had to sell the dwelling in order to be demolished in 2014.
The sale price had fallen to EUR 132 000, so financial losses for Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the request, but Tola and Waroma won the case at both district and court courts.
The court ruled on the case on Wednesday.
It upheld the District Court’s judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of legal proceedings and liquidation of the couple.
The right to moderate the price reduction slightly, as buyers had already known some of the need to repair the dwelling at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the building errors revealed were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola looked for a home in good condition
Tola told the court that the couple had been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to do the repairs.
He had the impression that the building was renovated and in good condition and that there was no harm in the aspects mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report mentioned the risks and the lack of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water running along the rock surface.
However, the discussions did not reveal that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma were left with the impression that rainwaters from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years it became apparent that the moisture problems of the dwelling were much more serious than expected.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 revealed microbial growth in the building, which, according to the Witnesses, were due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the ground moisture that rose capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes was estimated by the inspector to have reached the interior of the porch.
The mold or yeast that makes the health risk possible, above the limit values, was found in brush samples in the home care room, in the basement stairwell, in the windower in the living room and in the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
There was also a dispute in the court as to whether the dwelling had been extended contrary to the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo’s decision to make changes to the dwelling contrary to the permit before the transaction.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were not yet any appropriate permits.
However, mold problems were central to the court.
According to the Court of Justice, on the basis of information received from the seller before the sale, purchasers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for extensive repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma felt that there was no particular reason to carry out a wider inspection than usual.
Buyers have not neglected their reporting obligation, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archival discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - also Finns in the register
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article by Dagens Nyheter on how documents are stored in the National Archives of the United States of Maryland for a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
The majority of women are German, but they are also American, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to become a Nazi bride.
The documents and licenses originate from the Nazi German Racial Bureau.
The Racial Bureau was under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were conducted in women to investigate the situation.
Among other things, the Bureau of Race investigated women’s background by studying church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the Racial Agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from those close to them.
The Racial Bureau wanted to guarantee that women were "child lovers", "saved" and "good national socialists" who knew German very well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a government-supported program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that every SS man should have four children, whether married or not.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not actively promoted, the website of the Holocaust Museum of the United States reports.
Instead, Nazi demographic politics focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by offering loans and supporting children.
A German mother’s Cross of Honor was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
The 6th of Sire the traitor, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was third in sailing at the Rio Olympic Games on the first day of Finnjollie’s day, but remained the top of the whole group at the second.
In the overall situation, the sparrow rose to eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought for RS:X class day departures in places 17 and 3.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren remained in the 23rd place at the start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep: "I was so hung over"
Jari Sillanpää has been a favourite Finnish artist for over 20 years.
From the bartender of the cruise ship to the Tango King of 1995, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of the dance boards and festivals, Sillanpää is still in a state of ferociousness.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen about the life of his favorite singer, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of his life and career as good as bad.
Bridgehead’s career rose to a total rise as he won the tango king’s crown in the Seinäjoki Tango market in 1995.
In the race Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different shape.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
However, the book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and just after a few hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so hung up!
Bridgehead remembers in the book.
The recording of a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately be guessed that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, it was still a good print.
I learned that all the time you don't have to ask yourself to be perfect and peaked.
Another incident related to one of the most popular pieces of the man’s book occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his partner at the time and the case ended up in the single text published in 2014.
The book says that the lyrics ordered from Saara Törmäsä were not what Sillanpää would have liked.
The bridgehead had imagined he was making a record telling a true story about his own life, but the words of the breakup song were not true, it was written on the basis of the news in 7 days.
In the newspaper’s news, Jar’s and his ex-lover’s divorce were attributed to Jar’s excessive partying and drinking, but Jari said it was total nonsense and was not true.
According to the book, he was furious with the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually he ended up singing it, and that's a good thing.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their empire out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the resignation and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polls of the voting week are predicting the opposite.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support for staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for divorce, even though a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The theme of the recent election campaign by former US President Bill Clinton, 'It's the economy, stupid', flew into a scrap heap in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Financial Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics provides professionals with answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation by economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the real Brit.
Many people also have the impression that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing, because it will promote the export industry.
Economist opinion was that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
In particular, they were beset by the neutrality of the BBC, which provided as much room for only a couple of per cent of economists in favour of the EU separation, as for the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hated press was not interested in explaining what the views of IFS, IFM, BOE, CEPR and LSE and other economic fangs are on the consequences of the separation.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke facelessly of economic growth, trade relations, central government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored, because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not feel that they have common interests.
Although academics such as Economists would have stayed in the EU, the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Immigration is an economy, too.
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants congest your hospital, immigrants take advantage of you.
These arguments work.
Every cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
In the waiting room of every health centre, you can see immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they weren't there?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the children of the right British to get a place to go if they were to get rid of them?
Foreigners live in every municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I believe that these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepared for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, provision was made in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, the victory of the EU divorce camp, began to be better prepared for a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left.
The concern was that investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We left to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily listing of the real estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
According to old age, the normal level would be 15-20 percent.
The value of the fund was GBP 3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds," says Vanhanen of all open real estate funds in Britain.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds fell to or even below 10%.
Real estate funds were therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed down trade
When the EU-registration camp won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm,” says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, who estimated that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, Standard Life, the first of the real estate funds, froze its trading.
Together, these looted the situation and brought the matter to the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Olden, they did not actually close the deal, but changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, he said that investors were given time to consider whether to withdraw the money in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it's going to be a loss.
It calmed things down, and most of them canceled.
Since then it has been quite stable, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that there has been no similar turmoil in the continental European funds of Aberdeen, for example.
However, there were a lot of inquiries.
Excessive attention to real estate funds
Mr Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate funds received an excessive amount of attention.
Open funds affected by closures account for about four per cent of British property.
Aberdeen’s lockout lasted for six days, and the company sold out less than ten properties of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might stick to its fund for 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been rife downwards, but the situation does not appear to be more "horrible" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some of the real estate investors," Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its lowest in 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
A dollar collector can now buy the same property for up to 30 percent less.
There are many willing buyers," says Vanhanen.
Brexit's investments in the London real estate market
At 2:00 in the morning, things didn't look too good.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the property investments in Aberdeen Asset Management in the British Real Estate Fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's the word.
I realized that this is now going to Plan B," says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed straight for work.
London City was already fully alive, despite the morning.
The TV screens that were normally fixed at the office were loud enough to sound the news, and usually the loud people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell us about his breakup.
When the market opened, the screens flashed just red.
It was such a morning that you never thought you would live, says Vanhanen.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdee, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, i.e. the Midsummer.
The atmosphere was a mess.
However, the company had well prepared for the option, which is why the situation was calm in a way," says Vanhanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went for a change.
The market started to anticipate drastic declines in the UK real estate market, especially in London.
In the coming years, the London office space was expected to be up to 20% negative.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trading one after another.
Even Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the tumult has subsided, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not show its last summer holidays in Helsinki this week on Vanhanen's face.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about Brexit’s consequences.
So much is still open: how does the difference happen and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the subject of initial information.
The CBRE data on price developments of the real estate service company cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minuses amounted to 6.1 per cent, says Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures," says Vanhanen.
All similar falls hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was very quickly compared with Lehman’s collapse and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Mr Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite accurate, since it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real estate market has not seen panic sales of that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity," says Vanhanen.
There's a lot of funding going on.
The repair movement could have been in front of us anyway.
As a matter of fact, he doesn't find it a miracle that a price-fixing movement could have been in front of him if it wasn't for Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, property prices in London and other world’s top cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the drop started at a really high level.
London's prices have tightened up for four reasons, Vanhanen List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, London's population has grown strongly.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalising," says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have entered the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is an easy target as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which, for example, has forced pension companies to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the debt lever has now been used significantly less than during the pre-2008 boom.
Disperse, disperse
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also began to relax its holdings in London, and last year he was a net seller.
There was some kind of change in the way we expected, and now it came.
So, what's next?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He's afraid to judge the future, but he says there's hardly going to be a rise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or steady road ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more movements up and down, as he has been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks that work can get us out of the hole.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralisation, the risks are also distributed," says Vanhanen.
S-Group begins to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon the S-Group will know what you eat, because today the trading group said that it is beginning to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its regular customers.
By the time information has been collected on the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to pick up it from the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group follows Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, the CEO of K-Plus Oy, feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used subject to authorisation for marketing purposes.
The most efficient channel is e-mail.
Quite few customers have banned the use of product information," Riitala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko does not intend to react to a change in the registration of the S Group.
Kesko already classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to simple food purchases.
The classification is updated monthly.
Regular customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a regular customer program and there is no such thing planned for the moment.
Finland's Near Finland has its own onesbonus customer loyalty program, which can be associated with the selection houses, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting product or product group-level data, we remain at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made and what day and the customer's receipt total.
We have not gone to the level of the K-Group or the S-Group, says Anu Ora, Trade Director.
According to him, the customer loyalty programme is to be reformed in the future, but the local store will tell you about it later.
However, the Ora does not consent to the registration of product information.
Start with the experiment
SOK's customer ownership and customer register has been relatively wide up to now.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information includes occupation, education, form of residence, years of birth and previous personal data of children.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded from the S-Front card purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash-flow systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
By contrast, data are recorded at product group level for the time being in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terroi and ABC chains.
For a long time, customers have had hopes that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Activities at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data are stored in the bags, whether they like it or not.
A willing person can check his or her data stored on the S Group's website.
For example, the cashiers are unable to access the data, stresses Saarirki.
Video: Heila puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - the puppy becomes the first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever’s puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won’t be long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing with his favorite toy.
In the box next to which Heila sat, a jar of powder - gas grappling shells were exposed.
The powder gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila," says Suntio, the owner of the dog Heila.
Security situation and main reasons for online commerce
Heila is Customs' first dog specialising in the exploration of weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
If necessary, tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossings and ports.
However, the airport will be the main workplace in Heila, as the international security situation has changed as a result of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused action at Customs and, after the attacks, controls have been strengthened," says Mikko Grönberg, Senior Inspector at Customs.
The second main reason for the training of the gun and explosives dog in Customs' tasks is postal mail via Helsinki Airport.
As a result of the increased internet trade, as many as 40 million postal items pass through the airport each year, including military equipment and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made some 300 discoveries related to arms, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials from online shopping, passenger aircraft luggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered luggage and mail.
In ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether further weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
Heila puppy training is coordinated by the Finnish School of Dogs in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to the police and defence experts with Heila.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, will decide what smells Heila will be taught to recognize.
Heila will always be further trained as needed," says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Customs' six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting drive, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntio's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't go anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila once and for all.
The cameraman of the Evening Messages loses the mic shield of the camera to the fast dog, but Heila returns the soft toy-looking cap immediately from the "loose" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila’s initial education will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is adequate for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come to iron a dog on a work vest, like Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten years, after which they retire to their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active hours only last from ten minutes to two hours.
The owner of working dogs is a fierce competition in Customs.
Heila's owner applied for about 20-30 Customs employees.
Luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and surveillance tasks in Customs.
The mini-state got their first Olympic medal - the people get a day off
Fiji’s Olympic gold of less than a million inhabitants in rugby is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the National Broadcasting Company, the Fijian Government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day off is the day after the team's return home.
There will also be celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji's rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital city of Suva, where a screen was erected in the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought together our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them cheering, said Maikele Seru Guardian, editor of the Fiji Times.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kilos after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening quality for lifters.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos of thrust and 145 kilos of rapture.
He's got a total score of 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get his last thrust of 175 kilos, as well as his second.
In the third attempt, the weights rose along with the fierce roaring.
The body was shaking under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
A Finnish buyer’s joy was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired the Estonian attacker Prosa - Veikkausliitto - Evening Sanomat
The Rovaniemen Ball Association, playing in the Men’s Football League, has concluded a long-term contract with the Estonian attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player on our team who has power and whose threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We went through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Gradually, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora, Tallinn, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played on the Estonian national team.
Prosa is supposed to be with RoPS already on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemins meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS became in need of a new attacker when last season’s goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Defiant Modern Family Star shone again: teen star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who has been known as Alex Dunphyna as a good friend of the modern Family comedy series, is once again blubbering by showing her haughty body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also his ass.
Lately, 18 - year - old Winter has attracted attention by changing her style and behaviour to a much bolder degree.
The star has posed in pictures published on social media in very limited clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very limited clothing.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has also recently published several pictures of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can check it here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has spent most of his life on television and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has resented some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It is not difficult to guess where he will be in ten years, when the decline is already so severe, says a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Instead, some of the fans of the woman defend the actor and urge that they ignore criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to a lot of women. You're an inspiration to a young woman.
Japanese people prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted to the northern lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirör aurora
The purpose of the campaign is to encourage the Japanese to start Northern Light Trips in early autumn," says Visit Finland in the press release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese northern lights.
Northern lights are a key asset of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to the heart of winter and snowy landscapes.
The winter northern lights in Lapland are in great demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in the fall and goes on long into the spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirör aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision twofold fabulous, says Visit Finland’s acting marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the visit Finland’s Northern Light Campaign is the wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35, who live in the city and dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, for example.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among the Japanese compared to the other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese could use clearer unique sights in Finland, and Lind says that the northern lights have enormous potential.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown considerably more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double the number of nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain settles for rugby silver as Fid's master course leads to gold
Britain’s impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed in Fiji’s finals on Thursday evening, when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organized a master course in reading, chewing, evasiveness, support, running lines and pure force when winning the gold - their first Olympic medal.
With the defeat came a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - Britain's third day - and they were allowed to take pride in their hard work at the Olympic rugby kickoff tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 victory of the semi-finals played earlier that day in South Africa may have bothered them in the finals.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won a top 15 team in this condition.
Great Britain may be comforted - but probably not - by the fact that at least one Britishman will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former British boss from Wimbledon.
It's been quite a trip for Britain.
Eight years ago, they were trained by Ryan to lose every game in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they lost only one.
This beating hurts, but the development is startling.
Fidi got off to an excellent start, rejecting British tackles for fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like running into buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner to the finish line.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwain’s second touchdown at the right end led to a goal kick.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s brilliant tackle stopped the male mountain Leone Nakarawa from scoring third goals, but it was only a delay for Fidi.
At seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu scored a goal at the right angle, and Britain was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again on the new start, and there was still more than a minute left on the clock...the first half.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvou rushed through the loose tackles of Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the break was 29-0.
It looked like Fidi was born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that is actually the case.
Britain made a series of changes during the break that blocked Fidi's dam...for a total of four minutes, which, compared to the first half, was fine until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton scored a goal for Britain when he reached the left corner of the touchdown and narrowed the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was difficult not to admire Fidi’s joyful approach.
Mata Viliame had a last-minute goal with a frosting on Fidi's cake that didn't need frosting.
The whistle was whistled, the Fidians hugged, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semifinals 20-5, and Britain won South Africa in a tight semifinal, where each scored one goal - the British goal kick solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the top at the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with dazzling footwork and scored the goal below the goalposts at the second half.
A great late tackle from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-aside-rugby team Anthony, secured the victory and finally the silver medal.
The coach’s fight against cancer led Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold in these games, and that really means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hauls towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were rowing alone, there were three votes on the boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was present all the time when the two were racing their second consecutive Olympic gold in a women's couple contest, the first women in British sports history books to achieve such an achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th performance unbeatable, which is also record-breaking.
This, what we see, two brilliant athletes joining the surface with a swan’s sweetness, not fully reflecting the nature of victory.
Each rowing gold is based on a group of helpful pair of hands who gradually promote the things that matter. And no pair of hands was as relevant as a coach who, after 30 months of diagnosis of cancer, did not know if he would live to this day.
Like he said, it was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be operated on, and they performed the surgery.
If they don't operate, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate that his treatment could be started at the beginning of 2014 outside the period, when they caused as little interference as possible - if that expression could ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple thought of Williams, who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced captain from the regiment of the Royal Artillery in Afghanistan, said: "I have been an emotional wreck this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just underlines how important this is to me, how hard Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
It's been three years with Helen and Robin. They've been great.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so she deserves a lot of thanks. She's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the race in five years.
The couple set a rough rhythm that their rivals couldn't reach.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very closed in an instant.
Helen shouted, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just trying to get a good row and win the race, and that's what we did.
A couple wait a year before deciding their future.
Glover will be at the wedding next month when he marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
This is where it lasted about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the government of Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters infuriated by the Panama data leaks already demand in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that many Icelandic politicians were circumventing taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been decided on October 29th.
According to the analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the population’s rage last spring will affect the election results of the autumn.
In June, the presidential elections showed a clear critical attitude towards those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected President.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he said Obama was the founder of Isis.
Donald Trump, president-designate of the U.S. Republicans, withdrew his latest remarks.
He said that he was being sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation Isis and the democratic candidate Hillary Clintonk was involved in the establishment of the organisation.
The Democratic Party was furious at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
You should never let anyone who can sink that low, Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a burkini bathing suit preferred by Muslims on beaches, reports, among other things, the British newspaper Guardia.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who does not have a bathing suit that respects good manners and secularism.
The decision also states that bathing suits that display religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorderly behaviour in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a French national day crowd.
At the end of July, two extremists linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the sieve - Blue algae opacity in Lake Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official beaches of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Blue-algae opacity has only been observed at Lake Pyhäkösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other public bathing areas.
Apart from the shore of Meriniemi, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing areas were below the intervention limits laid down in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and Enterococcal in the bathing water of Meriniemi were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue algae opacity found at Lake Pyhkösjärvi’s beach does not yet make the water unsinkable, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue algae bloom, creating blue green algae on the surface of the water as rafts.
The environmental action will monitor the situation through frequent inspections.
If blue algae opacity turns into blue algae flowering, the bathing area’s information board will also be provided separately.
Check the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generation of forest farm change.
In the Ministry of Finance's proposal, the reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the pure capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forestry of the Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr Hakkarainen finds criticism in the proposal for a tax change.
A forest gift reduction is proposed for the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income less all other deductions.
According to MKK and Hakkarainen, the effectiveness of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The proposal of the VM assumes that a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry will prevent it from making a loss in the capital income of forestry which would be deducted from other taxes.
Such a person would receive a tax advantage even if he did not sell wood.
The calculation model is too complicated.
The average forest owner is not able to perceive it," Hakkarainen says.
In addition, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The tax deduction bound to the value of the forest is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
He thinks it's too high.
As such, he says it eliminates 82 percent of Finnish forest owners.
The model would affect about 10 per cent of forest owners," he says.
The VM considers that the border guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the farm.
According to Hakkarainen, forestry policy has taken the reduction of forest gifts for decades.
It is driven by the ageing of forest owners.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The heavy hail caught the motorists at Himanga, two cars fell into a ditch and crashed into each other.
A special tail chase took place on Friday morning in Himanga, Kalajoki.
According to the Rescue Department, two cars running in a row fell into a ditch, after which the one behind came crashing after the time.
According to Harri Pyhätkä, the fire engineer on duty, the detachment in the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a severe hailstorm.
The car behind us had two persons, both of whom were hospitalized.
There's no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver who drove the car above was not injured.
The accident occurred on Route 8 from Himanga to Kalajoki a few kilometres away.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help to improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
The findings made by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s research group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to normal soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer medicines by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in the treatment of cancer cells.
The research results were published on 4 August in Nature Communications, a prestigious journal on cell biology.
Muhos's family home murder continues in court, the prosecutor also asks for a murder sentence for another offender
The threshing of Muhos’ family home murder continues in court for both convicted persons.
In June, two young men were sentenced to prison for the murder of a family in Muhos.
One was awarded eight years for four months for killing and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
A manslaughter conviction was also convicted of a gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and the transport of a vehicle as a young person without entitlement.
The district court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the plaintiffs and the more severely convicted man.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has received a milder sentence be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
At the time of the act, they were in full understanding.
According to the District Court, 17-year-olds killed a man who worked as a director of a child welfare unit at a school in July last year.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a counselor from behind on the couch in the living room.
The director had come out of the grip and walked the young one into his room, and one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten, and kicked in the head.
According to the state of mind survey, at the time of the act, both of the convicted were in full understanding.
According to the court, young people had planned to escape from a family home, at least from the day before.
Ice shark is the world's longest-lived vertebrate, growing only at the age of 156.
The longest living vertebrate in the world has been confirmed by an ice shark, says a study published in Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark, which swims around Greenland, can live up to 400 years old.
The female doesn't grow until she's 156.
The life span of an ice shark is increased by an increase of only one centimeter a year.
Only a species of shellfish is known to live longer than the ice shark.
Investigators discovered age in radiocarbon dating.
Because of the nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the scientists were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old, although the throwing in one direction or another may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as a financial savvy - People’s News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the government's total tax revenue would not be received if the change in corporate tax promoted by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenue would also be reduced, especially as a result of tax relief that benefits the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge sum of $1 000 billion a year that would not be collected.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after the reduction proposed by Trump 33.
The inheritance tax would be abolished altogether.
Mr Trump accused the state of over-regulation in the business sector and of bankrupting small businesses.
The agreed environmental standards must be renewed and energy regulation dismantled.
Barack Obama's healthcare reform needs to be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed as "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Mr Trump, "spoiled" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be abolished.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty tax of 45% and from Mexico of 35%.
We're offering you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will unite cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift up new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unlike his practices, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by the assistants, even though it was interrupted 14 times by well - organized protests.
Economists - including those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States into deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
A wave from the past - People’s News
The sea roars fatally, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street rage - the reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarized the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelity.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travel lovers (2013) was a fun little satirical comedy with a Ronski side, the pre-skin Skin where I live (2011) the peaks of the career of the SpanishITur.
Gradually Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's an amicable love, relationship and family drama, the focus of which is the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in its pattern with the middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of an occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) may be amazed to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta repeated the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, from the moments when he met his future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, will be added to the second leading female role, from the series Ommelte time (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a lump, but I myself would say that quite cleverly and literally with a single wipe.
Almodóvar films often have such distinctive brilliance, up to their humor, in Julieta there is a fair distance.
It is a flatly played, restrained, place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish instructor is still there, so that it gradually begins to wink at more as a purely formality than as a working dramatic effect.
Diseases, deaths, or other sudden losses that affect the person in the film, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is particularly true for costumes: in the case of a person with a name, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is very specific in these matters, but the main point is that the setting of the scene in question is not particularly improved.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is outward and slightly inanimate.
Almodóvar has written the manuscript on the basis of three novels by Alice Munro, a Nobel Prize-winning Canadian.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a slightly evenly written literary filming.
The ingredients would have been emotionally superior to the more powerful drama, that much big stuff - especially gnawing guilt - deals with the thematics of the film.
Director and Manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munron's three novels.
Main features: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The premiere of the film is 12.8.
Government tries election trick - People’s News
No new cuts are made, saying ministers, so that the Finns of Finland do not collapse completely.
However, the cuts decided on in the spring are carried out by a lot of people.
There won't be any more surgeries.
The 4 billion savings that have already been decided will suffice.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co-) under the budget line.
It is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since cuts in social security were already decided at the spring spending limits debate.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are reduced by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts are continuing.
♪ The town halls are haunted ♪
Why do ministers insist so strongly that no further cuts are made on them?
Because next year's an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important thermometer in the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election results that take government parties in different directions spoil the government's atmosphere for a long time.
The Gallups, however, tell us that the Finnish Government Party expects a defeat, even though the result of its previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent compared to the Parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns of Peru received 752 new councillors, many of whom next spring will be realised the price of influence in the right-wing government.
The lifeline of the government of three or more equal parties rests on the ability of the Finns to endure.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for the party have had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party’s parliamentary group’s fermentation status have also surfaced.
First of all, there will be no new cuts in the rhetoric that obscures the fact that next year they will be carried out violently and, secondly, an attempt to soften the blow that is waiting for the Finns.
Major surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set itself the target of rescinding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take EUR 5.9 billion into account next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands halfway through the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt is not fold-up or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
This means new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be cut at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring elections, when it comes to parliamentary elections, it will be accepted.
These measures do not give rise to deleveraging
It is quite clear that the current measures do not give way to debt, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to stir up a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäki at the awareness-raising conference show that this is irrefutable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no drawback from the international economy.
Since the collapse in 2008, the Finnish economy has hardly risen, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
In this decade, unemployment has increased by 35% and lengthened from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of next decade.
What's responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion next year, which will in practice be fully covered by new debt.
This is the view of the centre, the National Coalition Party and the Finns of Peru, of what is responsible.
Query: We want to leave a lot of tasks to the municipalities
Three out of four consider that children's day care, youth work and physical activity are the responsibility of the municipality, as is clear from the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A clear majority of the population also assumes responsibility for libraries, culture, adult education centres, building supervision, upper secondary school education and waste management.
In turn, regional planning, special care, vocational education, polytechnics and institutional care for people with mental disabilities are the most clearly sought responsibility of the region.
There is no desire to delegate any of the tasks entrusted to the state by the municipalities.
A minor drunk driver ran away from the police at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver from Joensuu was driving a police patrol in Joensuu at the Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half a.m.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but a young man took off driving a police officer to a fair speed.
The pursuit continued on Sonkajarantantie, from which to Sorronahontie and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drifted off the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster - footed policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The driver's breath test showed 0.75 per mil.
He also did not have a driving licence that justified driving a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a rock truck fell into a ditch.
The truck in the stone cargo fell into a ditch at Kulvijärvi on Kavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted to the left in a curved corner out of the road and fell into a ditch on its side.
The rescue services picked up the injured driver through the door above the fallen truck, along with the rescue helicopter staff and paramedics.
The owner of the vehicle was left behind to lift the vehicle.
From the crashed truck, hydraulic oil was poured into the road and sucked into the peat by the rescue department.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared this afternoon on the Ilmajoki River.
A 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä, South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about six feet [165 cm] long, slender and good - conditioned with white hair that stretches under her chin.
The sightings and clues of missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia Situation Centre’s tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of Parafest’s destruction
The crash that knocked down the tents at the Parafest Festival caused extensive damage.
Arto Pepperi, Chairman of Joensuu's Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be economically well-established, and the event can also be organised next year.
At the end of Friday night, the last performer of Parafest was Kalle Salonen.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the City Theatre premises starting at 1 p.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.
The programme will be organised as planned.
When rainwater and its weight initiate a descending air flow, the flow of thunderstorms occur.
Changes in the water form of the thunder cloud bind heat and thus cool down the downward air mass and accelerate its speed toward the earth.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several surges occur in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the currents.
The flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four persons were slightly injured in the accident.
Among them was one child who was transported to further care with a slight injury.
Air Pollution Ages the Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study is told by Evening Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analyses the most toxic particles in London air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people of retirement in London is two and a half years older than that of a person who lives in rural areas, for example.
The fine particles that age the skin are very fine dust pollution from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to the Evening Standard, almost 9 500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel on foot near crowded streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with masks, but regular cleaning of the skin is recommended as a more practical solution.
The tractor's brakes failed... pushed a man standing in front of him.
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not under it, but the tractor was able to push the man to the point of being transported to the central hospital for further research, seriously injured.
The tractor did not run further than that, as it collided with the stones in front of it.

Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jampänen has played in almost all the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now there are already six competitions in Tampere, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better at North American competitions.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy national team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jampanen, 48, says.
He was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987 Jumppänen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu the kind of sport was not yet played at the SM level like Salibandy.
They played the telegram at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later I played hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series.
Josba played Salibandy's SM series with the university during the 1991-92 season, following three seasons.
In addition to playing, he coached the A-girls of the club for the championship.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold is missing in the trophy cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach Volley’s Finnish championships will be held at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
In three days, medals will be played in the series of both adults and young people.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball players and the Finnish Volleyball Association, the six best pairs of the rankings of each series are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was a member of the Finnish beach volleyball peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for the baseball stadium.
I haven't played in adult shows very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals around the corner, Hasu moods.
Kouvola region lit Hasu's spark for sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories in mind about being a kid.
I started volleyball when I was nine years old in the E-girls of Elimäki's NMCA.
On top of it is a jersey too big, knee pads on ankles and huge ace screams and choreographs after a point," Hasu recalls.
In a small locality, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
We were trained by the father of a teammate, and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyy was already a natural choice of species to counterbalance indoor volleyball.
Songs have been played on the beach in the Archipelago since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also went to the Juniors' SM Tour sectionals myself, thinking that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Annina Parkkinen, who beat the shit out of her at the SM finals this weekend.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second-ranked duo in the tournament is clear.
As a realist, we have a medal.
SM-Honey, we're still missing the trophy cabinet. Hasu throws mysteriously.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasu's familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are awaited in the field of civil work.
Yes, the international career will be over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the slippers will be put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon’s Koli courageously set out to be an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial activity means taking risks, sweat and energy.
A young farmer, Solomon’s Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Soon two years ago, Koli, together with his younger brother Valtteri Kol, started to work as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant taking up debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to do business on a farm, and now that I started out as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard pole, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I was really brave enough to go along with the project and have been fully involved in it," says Solomon Koli and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything would be all right.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who grows meat trucks, is to invest in an even larger barn.
The work has been successful, since Solomon's Koli has been selected among the top ten in the competition for the young food producer of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible victory.
You can vote for him on the magazine's website until 21.8.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (after June 2012) and the first figure above zero after October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
Annual average inflation, measured by the cost-of-living index, was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016) in the last 12 months compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
In July 2016, the cost index was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 an increase was observed in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), miscellaneous goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchat's "anime" effect is rated as Asian caricatures
According to Snapchat, anime has been a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool Snapchat enables some 150 million daily users to shape reality and play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lentils are simple, face-wrapping tools that produce over 30 million improved selfies a day.
All false steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticized with accusations that the application advertises blackface masks or prefers bleached skin color as a beauty ideal.
So this week when Snapchat advertised to some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics called it racist caricature from Asian people - "yellow face" or yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring polemics could be a sign of the company’s greater problem of diversity.
News and disapproval were widespread on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day later Snapchat said that he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: Lens was meant to be a tribute to the anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strictly denied the comparison of animes.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets of photographs were widely distributed, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that 'it is difficult to argue against a comparison of the outrageous Asian caricature and the effects of the filter'.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme demeanor.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught up in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat’s vast audience of young people more diverse than their parents can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image for the user, "it's much more difficult for these guys to be inconspicuous than before".
On Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his article to Medium and in a telephone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s pay practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s mainly white male management and finished writing with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#RemoveSnapchat)
"They either have no diverse representation of different skin colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make decisions of this kind," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have different skin colors at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak frankly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to answer.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial background of his staff, but according to a representative, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on under-represented populations and to push forward internal integration efforts.
For his part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congressional Panel, military officials were tampering with Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, a congressional panel told the authorities of the U.S. military military headquarters that they were preparing intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war in Iraq and Syria against ISIS than the events on the ground justified.
The interim report of the working group set up by the Republican Chairman of the Defence Forces Committee of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Funds Sub-Committee found 'widespread discontent' among the intelligence analysts at headquarters who said that the superiors tampered with their assessment of American efforts to defeat Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the military military field in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence output approved by the more senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. efforts to combat terrorism than justified by the facts on the ground, which were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other intelligence community agents," said the press release of the report.
"The events of Centcom are impossible to accept - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, a California Republican.
Centcom's management failures go all the way to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the constant problems with headquarters descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the reports were being tampered with by senior government authorities in Obama, it does describe the feelings of analysts as having been put under pressure by Centcom leaders to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many of the headquarters press releases, statements and certificates to Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," said the report.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack on the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in ISIS' possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas, in his statement.
From mid-2014 until mid-2015, the highest intelligence leaders of the U.S. military military headquarters were manipulating the intelligence output of the headquarters in order to minimize the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created a task force after hearing that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic state was manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results while the investigation is ongoing.
The Chief Superintendent of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives published their own findings which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process of intelligence evaluation of ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading Democrat.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence returns", worsened the mood among analysts and did not "give enough room for divergent perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they could not find evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions with a 'pre-set' or 'political' report.
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the Congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Superintendent has opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence will not comment on the Congressional Report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The study has other repercussions than the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Iraq and Syria are successful (as a growing number of defence agencies are now claiming).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to provide honest assessments of the war activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of Islamic state intelligence reflects a dispute over a decade ago when Centcom’s intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a study article saying that, despite the protests of several analysts, President George W. Bush’s regime supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year, the Hooker Group concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against the refineries controlled by the Islamic state had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside headquarters.
The Centcom commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticised last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate to be an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins for the fourth time in a row in a women's field hockey game, setting up a conflict with Britain
The day after having scored three goals on the team winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam scored on Thursday the first two goals of the US women’s field hockey team when the Americans won India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps track of his goals."
But he knows this: the Americans are in a 4-0 position at the Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will decide who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams.
The first one to avoid the strong Dutch, leader of the second group, for a little longer at the start of the quarter finals.
Whatever the end of Saturday’s game, the Americans have made a scene with their surprising success here, four years after they were last left at the London Olympics for 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey bat for the first time at age 3 (his older twin sisters played a sport in Drexel) in connection with the national team at age 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not part of the 2008 Olympic Games because he was unable to participate in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing worked out for him and his teammates.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed a coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace in London as we do now.
We've turned around.
On Thursday night, Bam started his first half with a knuckle-down near the finish line.
India had come to the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the situation at the end of the third period until Bam took control of the situation.
He carried the ball on the left side of the field for a long time, then circled into the middle and hauled the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to the 2-0 line.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goaltender to Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The tranquillity of the trampoline in the midst of the olympic rage
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, the Olympics are going on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, fierce message of competition and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a flaming baton of messages passed on from a archer to a swimmer and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read a newspaper, or listen to a neighbor’s conversation in a queue at a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky, or the hatred between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time in the Olympics and the future heartbreaker with a smiler, could well be one of the names known to everyone who is presented in prime time and supported by sponsorship agreements and good mind TV ads - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, competes for Olympic gold in the trampoline.
The Olympic flame doesn't shed as much light on all species.
Far further from the center, partly in the shadow, are the species not generally accepted by all: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a breaststroke. Long live it.
But if I may make a moderate issue of my special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the lowly charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it first performed at the Sydney Games, its presence in the past 16 years is so low that many of the people I interviewed did not realize it was an Olympic sport.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the sport, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not progressed to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan defend their London gold medals.
Trampoline, however, has a certain charm of the underdog, partly because it sounds more suited to the uncivilized ear than to the Olympic Games.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flightless fan.
There are possibilities for amusement, as is noted by the coloring of the endless bouncy of cartoon films, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming leaps, two of which are basically combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means springboard.
The champions jumped up to a height of almost 30 feet with a giant trampoline, and they must perform spinning motion sets (turns, folds, and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes compete from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction of the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
Those hoping for medal must go further, faster, up and above, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in televised news coverage, another grotesque border: the world record or the Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and can even cause the viewer to cry.
But that is also the reason why watching the games can be a bit exhausting.
The trampoline offers you a rest from this.
Trampoline's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to a new rise, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but during the program there is no ferocious rush towards the end, no leaps into the distance, just a dreamy, smooth interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the Zen space as we can get to the Olympics.
Women's qualifiers and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 1 p.m. (ET), men's competitions will come on Saturday also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon program starting at 14 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic rush, they offer a quiet, charming moment, most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as recently suggested by the American male gymnasts according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his sighing new fan base.
"The generation is showing its mind" in Ethiopia, a long-standing ally of the United States.
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death during the clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
In the last decade it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong ally of the West, whose economy is growing rapidly.
In recent months, however, demonstrations against the government have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding a fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that dozens of unarmed protestors were shot and killed by police.
The widespread videos recorded during demonstrations, believed to be late last year or early this year, show how security officials beat young people with sticks while forcing them to stand against the wall with their hands.
The United Nations High Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager for the International Crisis Group in the Horn of Africa.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is Africa’s second most populous country, and the West appreciates its stability.
The American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa even has a new commuter train.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have constantly spoken of the oppression of the regime, the opposition has been restricted and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people and they have no choice but to demonstrate, this will happen," said Seyoum Tehome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
All the young people are showing their minds.
One generation shows its mind.
Complaints are diverse and cover everything in the stranglehold of the coalition's power over land use.
After the much criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies were given a seat by the last opposition, and now it holds all the seats in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to exploit the turmoil and rearm themselves.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of turmoil, bitter feelings are now exploding.
The first seems seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last few years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate their location through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oromos and Amharas, are better off with each other.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas, who come mainly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by taking advantage of oroms, many of which are Muslims and who live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"We're on our way to organize under one umbrella," said Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is being unfairly dominated by the Tigre people, who account for about 6% of the population and control the armed forces, the intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corners.
Analysts say that he was especially qualified to observe early signs of discontent and to use secret ambassadors to make opposers harmless.
"Today's administration has no basic instinct like that," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who came from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by the tigres don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia was in such turmoil in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to be the government’s first failure and then plundered.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protestors died, albeit less than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new commuter train, and for their remarkable advances in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the internal disdain of the Ethiopian Government.
And now it begins to take a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month protestors in the city of Amhara, Gondar, attacked companies owned by tigres, and hate against tigre is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations place the United States and other Western allies in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to neighboring Somalia, although it said some time ago that it closed this base.
Even though the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want their allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "there's real balancing."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-Based-Isis claim to be "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress the dispute that had taken over his latest campaign on Friday by claiming that he was not serious this week when he repeatedly insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of an Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have worked hard to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After an insinuation at the Wednesday evening campaign meeting, Trump continued to argue the same in Thursday’s interviews, where he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in the early Friday morning Twitter release Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was a complete turn from the day before when Trump said in several interviews that he really was serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump shrug his remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his hearing ears.
The most recent storm of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has tried to refocus his campaign in the midst of economic opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
Running off again on Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Late in July, when he faced a wide range of criticisms apparently when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying "I guess I'm being sarcastic".
This approach will enable Trump to go to the borders of political speech and then come back if necessary.
“I think it’s a model in which he tests certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then ‘clear’ in a direction or another depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cunning about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for the large voting audience, Trump has in recent days been more turbulent as his popularity has continued to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Trump lags behind Clinton considerably in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump tends to avoid apologies for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misconstruing his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces ever closer scrutiny over the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
The former mayor of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, worked hard to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real political comments in his words," Giuliani said when he was asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to claim that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter the attack on the news media, which grind his every word and are biased against him.
He mocked the "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to make sense of him and say, "They're not gonna make it!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuse for a new piece of evidence that he was unfit to be president.
The previously closed café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-accepting place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, it was too expensive for the Bedford Avenue street shaft.
The store that replaced Verbi in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soaps shaped like cupcakes.
It was saddened by the locals as the latest loss in a middle - class town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap store."
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-invention.
The revived Verb opened last November at Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
There is a wifi in the new Verbi and you can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unpretentious atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The new Verbi is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at the Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought a similar espresso machine.
It even used the lights of the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
She brought me some new ingredients.
On the menu there are bacon egg cheese sandwiches, and there are capers and browned onions on the tops.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
They don't serve beer at the coffee shop anymore, but they make fresh juices.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he has noticed a steady flow of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was also too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a client like this.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the Verb regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to a coffee shop.
He says that when Verbi closed down, he gave up his coffee drink for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink mixed instead of his usual ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully since 2003.
He used to go there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen past seven, regularly like a clock, I went in and they were preparing my spicy bagel with butter," he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes his regular order, but sometimes because of the variation he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge against a soap shop that took over old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verb a special soap that would be used as an ingredient in the coffee shop’s cold - extracted coffee.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to put it up soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold-extracted coffee.
It is possible that the café will expand into the building next door.
Many customers are satisfied with getting their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular, and he said he was inconsolable when the place was shut down.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he was coming home when he walked in and ordered a coffee.
"I had longed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Paralyzing Food of the Depression
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
As a cuddly mouth, President Roosevelt liked sophisticated Fifth Avenue foods like foie gras and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
On that day his diet was more modest — stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was an expression of culinary solidarity for the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The Brooklyn Heights couple are food historians.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in the Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they meet a journalist at a dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unscrupulous lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been in operation since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potato purée and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the depression.
"The murders were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut loaf, liverloaf, bean loaf.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating enough peanuts to make up your dinner.
Coe was a meaner.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
During the years before the recession, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like a eating-so-much-like-and-run buffet.
Women’s groups cooked for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicled the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a land of plenty.
"Then the food became a central, distressing subject for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, affordable diet: Mysterious foods, such as cereal and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a wonderful way to use food leftovers", mentioned Ziegelma, because the chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat that had been at the center of the American meals for years became a sparingly administered luxury product.
Special compositions were tested when calorie and nutrient content were more important than taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
Ziegelman also prepared an era’s dish of fried onions with peanut butter when he was doing research for a book containing recipes.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal."
There's no way peanut butter fits fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Office in 1923-1943, directed the country’s eating habits more than ever before or after.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetators" and to meet the challenge of converting lumps such as pure spaghetti and carrots into tasty portions.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reaction to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's attitude to let me eat cake.
While he publicly praised the simple, Iowan country food of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate a tuxedo in a nearly gold-plated dining room.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example in his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "provided not only one of Washington's worst, but also the worst prepared food."
Many of the paralytic eating habits were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Inheritance is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid to waste food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even made people sick."
There was a wind hat incident.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home — the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum foam," Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes an impressive name.
There was no whipped cream in dessert, just plums, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone unwittingly sunk their spoons in a sticky, brown glue.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe did it once and another.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of chopped walnuts could help."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against the hepatitis C patent against Merck
The U.S. engagement judge has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the legal expenses it incurs in a case involving a hepatitis C patient against Merck & Co Inc, a pharmaceutical manufacturer.
In June, Gilead was released for $200 million in payments after their violation of two Merck patents related to Gilead’s successful drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, a release that followed when a judge in the United States discovered Merck’s abuses involving perjury and other unethical practices.
In the judgment of Thursday, U.S. engagement judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to relief from the compensation it received in opposition to the action.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who controls the market in a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work at the bottom of the sofosbuvir active substance in Gilead medicines.
The US-supported forces say that they have completely taken over Manbij, ruled by ISIS.
After the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, a representative of the group said on Friday that the U.S.-supported forces have taken the city of northern Manbij, which is very close to the Turkish border.
The Syrian democratic forces (SDF) are now searching the city after the last group of fighters who hid in the city left.
The troops had released more than 2,000 civilians who were held captive by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish SDF's Ally, Manbij's Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to investigate it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 cost 34.2% of federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the Democratic presidential candidate and his spouse in that year was USD 10.75 million and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly 5.3 million dollars in speaking fees, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million dollars from Simon & Schuster for his book on his career in the State Department.
Clinton's vice president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published ten years' tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3%.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set a yardstick for financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
As a hard contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
According to custom, the U.S. presidential candidates publish their tax returns even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the Tax Board for an audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, said on Twitter, publishing a link to a Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump’s special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken up the problem on Friday's public network video, which brought out visible Republicans who are urging Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in recent decades has done: published his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist borrowed a large number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who said that the situation could still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At Clinton's meeting in Nebraska Omaha last week, Buffett, who is located there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Mr Buffett said that he is also running an audit of the tax administration, and that Trump is not "fearing" the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate for the Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's tax return for 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was an affordable indexed investment fund, and Clinton reported USD 109 000 in dividends and interest income.

Chili powder condoms and firecrackers enhance the protection of Tanzanian elephants
The conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from wandering into human settlements, throwing animals with chili powdered condoms.
The method has proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation developed several years ago together with the American Nature Conservancy has intensified its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-step approach to protecting homes and hundreds without harming the animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the elephant day of the world dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...the tools, we have discovered a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguie.
The first two steps include pointing a penetrating elephant with a flashlight and playing the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, throw the so-called "chili cloud."
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and a firecracker, after which the condom is twisted in such a way that only the fuse remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts with a bang and bursts the chili powder dust into the air.
Well, there's usually enough chatter to send an elephant in the other direction.
Last resort is a trigger that fires a Roman candle in the air, which produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed Israel’s area code at the request of the Arabs
A French filmmaker with Jewish background unleashed a media storm after exposing the fact that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's area code. According to the employee, this is due to Arab customers' "requests".
Claude Lanzmann, who made the Shoah documentary about the Holocaust, was venting his frustration at the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol Hotel, writing an open letter in a German FAZ publication.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the country's area code list offered by Israel's hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
In his search for an explanation, the filmmaker brought it up at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer there was "a shock to him".
The hotel's recipeist said it was a "considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused even more dismay in the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's area code," says the employee, according to Lanzmann.
Israel's German ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case a "great injustice", reports Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
"We were horrified and shocked by the incident.
It is already a great injustice in itself.
But even greater shame is the fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular chain of hotels.
This doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply ‘give in’ to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Go to sleep," said another publication that pointed out that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all charges and called what happened "inconspicuous" and "responsible" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"The clear order not to include Israel in the speed dial list was never made," says Kempinski's representative, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the area code has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students pointing at their minds
On Thursday the students met with the police in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo, when the students met to protest against the government’s reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to disintegrate the student group, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their horror over the plans.
According to the proposals of Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paolo State, just under 100 public schools would be closed down and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against the interim president Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters took off in a single force to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested in support of the country's Senate vote on his charge of office.
RT business: trade between Russia and Iran is growing suddenly by 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
After the removal of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in business operations in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"In fact, one of the most important objectives of Iran's two-way cooperation is the expansion of trade", said Dzhagaryan.
He pointed out that in the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 % compared to the same period of 2015, amounting to a total of USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16% to USD 158 million.
"Commerce growth was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Affairs Council in Iran issued some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It's safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in good condition," he said.
Scotsman Callum Skinner crashed into the finish line as the British captured the cycling gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner honoured the men's team prince at the Rio cycling stadium last night when the British team's trio defended their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was anchored in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, the legend was proud of the young man when he reached the finish line with the pre-favorite New Zealand team.
Britain won the shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold.
And they repeated the trick after modestly placing the sixth in the March World Race Championship in London, even though Hoy has since completed his race.
The problem between the Beijing and London Games was the replacement of Jamie Staff, a special sender.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoy's ending also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches held onto in view of the potential in the Scots that has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won the championship with Hoy four years ago... and Skinner made an Olympic record at the time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
After his own tour, Hindes was behind, but Kenny pushed the team to the top, and Skinner held onto it.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, and it included the Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny, and Skinner in particular, to hold on to the pace.
Hoy followed his position as a BBC expert and drew Skinner, Kenny and Hindes’ attention as they entered the podium.
A 23-year-old from Glasgow, Skinner, said, "The comparison is flattering."
I'm only here to do my best to make a name for myself.
In the finals, we made an Olympic record and won the world champions.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning in London in 2012, alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and Britain’s rivals have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem in the case of overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the pedestal."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten bikers both in Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to be successful for five days at the cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny’s condition, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy’s exploit, winning three Olympic gold in one Olympics.
That would mean that Kenny - exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (on that apparently holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would have the total number of medals in six gold and one silver.
It would be like Hoy's.
Kenny's next race is a sprint that starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one.
It's always the best team race.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To be honest, winning alone is lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the knight's rank."
This was the only medal competition today, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in time in a four-man, four-km team race.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and finals (22.42) will take place today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the focus of attention.
He had an argument with the judges yesterday before the time runs when the officials invited him to the length measurements.
In a similar women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald progressed at world record time at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its great racing team will take over the central part of the Olympic Games and reach the entire range of medals.
After presenting in Beijing and London truly exceptional and complete management, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
There has been drama in the background, the least of which has not been the difference between the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April because of the sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the career of the majors, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
On the basis of the first-night competitions at the cycling stadium, however, it seems that Britain’s now legendary reputation could now peak at a perfect moment.
The future of Portland's meltdown is questionable as a result of the cut in the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminium smelter, as well as of hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electricity distribution company revealed that one of the factory owners is closing a distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure follows the decision made earlier this year by the Victorian administration not to extend the aid required to maintain the plant.
The aid for a specified period of 20 years runs out in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoa Portland plant.
Up to 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, as the smelter uses about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's meltdown, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland meltdown is losing money and under threat of closure.
The measure is now following several years of speculation about the future of the factory, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the cost of production.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium smelter from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects the other three owners to close their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL is waiting for the operation of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the non-digestible physical need for electricity will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called ‘protection agreements’ which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period and are therefore effectively terminated in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects contracts to produce results for the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible performance effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by the strong outlook for wholesale electricity futures markets.
AGL said that it has already 'pre-emptively decided' reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by USD 187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the meltdown in operation or to secure the unmelted supply of electricity".
The US company said that it signed a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been on guard not only because of the meltdown in Portland in Victoria but also because of the possible closure of the Togo factory near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Earlier in the week, AGL’s Executive Director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts a year.
"If both factories exit the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electricity] markets.
For us, as a producer of electricity, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just the Kardashian reality show star, is on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the United States Vogue's wanted September issue.
Kendall, a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and modeled in Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this cover in a room full of loved people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover release was followed by a unique (or perhaps just a Kardashian style?), a scripted reality video with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and accompanied by everyone's favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up's producer Ryan Seacrest) forgetting his sister's cover, but which ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It is the cliché of almost every "birthday" television series for children (Sacrest says the lines "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" by the credibility of the morning-scene bunny), but Kris had to make his other girls somehow benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly entered the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendall’s older sister Kim may have made Vogue’s application first (he shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite unique.
Vogue's September issue is the most selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like the coffee protocol than the fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Phashion it was calculated that 615 of the 832 page opus last year had advertising content).
The revelation of its cover star is expected to be so intense that for the last two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more celebrities on the cover who act as models than 'models that are celebrities'.
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga's place of honor.
But if it were to happen that Jenner, whom the magazine describes as the "model of success" of his generation, would hit the first category, he would be in quite good company.
These celebrities are not relatives or reality stars of famous people or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (though Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who thrive in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career since the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is pleased with Jenner's success.
In his reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitch of the moment".
This feeling surfaced again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But being unsatisfied is out of the question.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue issue.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup cream.
He and all his sisters are selling you pictures of themselves in their own apps behind the payment wall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter he took to Love magazine.
And in her spare time, possibly just to see her sister, Kourtney and her children, she's a reality TV star.
Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away each year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people will be turned away from the Community's legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already far-reaching activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair evictions and the like - are already being turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
The legal services already stretched to the Community's limits are preparing for further cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Community Legal Centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"The Community's legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away every year from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, separated families, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents will be forced to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately cancel these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year the state government made a commitment to raise the financing of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and their customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was brought to trial after the employee was alleged to be at gunpoint.
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was brought to trial for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the head of the campaign’s action in North Carolina gunned down a worker in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in an action brought by Vincent Bordin, former software trainee of the state campaign at Charlotte State Court on Wednesday.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that it would not happen.
Chief Earl Phillip "put out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign administration, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, said in the application.
"There is no need to fire weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes only two days after a Republican presidential candidate caused anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second amendment" - generally understood by gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and had the choice of judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his words out of context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The Bordin challenge seeks compensation from the campaign for careless supervision and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump's representative Hope Hicks did not respond to a comment immediately.
Attempts to reach Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlote reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call to his consultancy company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not answered immediately.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and prosperity to the whole stomach, not just local communities and all over London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we went to a great deal of effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions would benefit from the Games.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
10 000 new traineeships and 40 000 new jobs will be created for local communities alone and youth unemployment will be eliminated around the airport.
Just as before the 2012 London Games, some will think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow who has implemented an infrastructure investment programme of £11 billion on time and in budget: T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, in T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by £16 billion of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games about blocking ads
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to bypass advertising are "cat and mouse games", said one of the companies producing such a programme.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block adverts on its computer-based website, Adblock Plus published a blog article saying that users can update the program filters in order to prevent advertisements again on the social network pages.
On Tuesday Facebook said that the code on its website will be changed around ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to see which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says it's circumvented the new code.
In a blog article, Adblock’s representative Ben Williams wrote that “a round-the-way battle between an open source advertising community and its users has been going on ever since the idea of blocking ads was invented,” and that Facebook could soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great tragedy that the ad blockers have become for industry.
Worldwide, some 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study. This is almost four times the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the ad blockers on the computer pages, because mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram," said the representative.
Computer ads still bring enough revenue to Facebook to consider such an activity worth investing in.
Also on Tuesday Facebook said that it was a daily "administration" tool to give people more power as to how to target ads to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were worrying because they would also block part of the site’s non-advertising content.
“This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem,” Facebook’s representative said in an email statement.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why instead we have focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
She was hit by a car on a Swiss highway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for eyewitnesses after a woman was hit by several vehicles on the highway during the early hours of Thursday in a case that apparently was suicide.
The incident took place on A1 near Morges in Vaudi canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did an "desperate act" and lay down in the dark on the road where she was hit by several vehicles," the Vaudin police said in a statement.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been questioned, but not everyone has yet been identified, reports the police who appeal to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to report.
A criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a "logical" step in this kind of situation, the lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
"However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
That remains for the prosecution to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases - both of which were the person who was walking in the dark on the freeway - it was estimated that motorists could not expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released from charges of negligence on the death penalty after he hit and killed a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and passed out on the road, the court was informed.
The Court found that the police who were responding to the emergency call were driven in a justified manner and that the man's presence on the road was 'a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation', the judge said.
Anyone with information on the Thursday case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model estimates, Venus was likely once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus’ past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the hot, waterless surfaces of Venus and the air frame filled with carbon dioxide could at times have had earthlike conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus’ slow rotation speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin earthlike atmosphere, and it could still have rotated slowly.
The model also looked at early Venus surface formation.
The planet probably had more drier areas than the earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to make life possible and to protect from rapid water evaporation.
Early Venus also had the advantage of a 30 - percent dim sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus reveals its side of the day to the sun for almost two months at a time," explains GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella, protecting the surface in large part from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the current Earth temperature.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus, similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be habitable at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gases, Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up Avalanche's coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the coach of Colorado Avalanche and the vice-president of hockey, saying that it was the reason for the lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Vice President/Director Joe Sakic of Colorado confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice-President and head coach of the hockey affairs of Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in his statement.
During the summer I have thought long and hard about how I could improve this team in order to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the Vice-President of hockey must be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions affecting the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not being met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him well in the future.
Roy was appointed the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league during his first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the victory of the Central Division, but Minnesota knocked down Colorado in the first round of the playoffs, and the team has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche games in the season 2015-16 ended in 39 wins, 39 loses and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing a wild card playoff slot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame’s chosen goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups – two in both the Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone the strike
Industrial battles between North Sea oil workers for wages will be postponed when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
Strikes against Wood Group oil service company have been arranged randomly on the North Sea drilling platforms led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", said the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will have several full-day meetings starting early next week so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to trade unions, their recent industrial action, which they say will be the first for more than 25 years, was an objection to possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
This year Wood Group cut the fees for North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company’s premium reduction results in a 10 per cent reduction of contractors in its countries for 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of people off their payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its massive merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish MEP, met with the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labour disputes of the generation.
He said that the North Sea was essential to the region's economy.
"We need an economy that works for many, not for a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in his statement.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than $1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, while the previous five-year average has been about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiadi Cluster
The latest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete listing of the speeds of the Pleiad stars.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the constellation are spinning at varying speeds, and how rotation times are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Pasadena Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis of Caltech, in a press release
The Pleiad Cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars were born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning at their top level now.
At its peak speed, these growing stars plunge large amounts of starwind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they slow down the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by following the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest list of star speeds suggests that the more massive stars rotate slower than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, the bigger ones making the devilets slower than the smaller ones.
"In the pleiads' ballet we see that slow bikers are usually more massive, while the fastest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the Pleiad constellation is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of the stars at rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian Cluster offers an anchor for the rotation of the stars into theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and, so to speak, hang their 'dance shoes' on the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiads in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
