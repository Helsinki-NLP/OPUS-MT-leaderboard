Members of the Wales delegation are afraid they'll look like fools.
Some Members are confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP, namely the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
This was the beginning of a plan to change the name of the assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Parliament are concerned, regardless of the party position, that change may make them ridiculed.
According to one Labour representative, the group is concerned that the name "sorts with words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to one representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group is 'not satisfied' and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group takes a "open mind" to change the name, but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the word MWP to the word for fool.
In the Welsh language, the w-letter is pronounced in a similar way to the Yorkshire U-letter.
The Commission, which is currently preparing a legislative amendment to the name change, stated: 'The final decision on the headings describing the members of the assembly is, of course, for the members themselves'.
The Law on the Welsh Administration of 2017 empowers the Parliament to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which there is broad support for the nomination of the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission preferred the Welsh MEPs or the short WMP as the title of its members, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
It appears that the Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus may cause a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to have a legislative proposal for amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on changes includes other changes in the functioning of the delegation, such as the rules on the loss of office and the form of the committee system.
When dealing with legislation, Members of the Parliament may give their last vote on the title they should be called.
Macedonians go to the ballot box in the referendum on the change of name of the country
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether or not to change the name of the country to the "North Macedonia Republic".
The referendum seeks to resolve a decades-long dispute with a neighbouring country, Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a territorial requirement for its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said that he is ignoring the vote.
However, supporters of a referendum such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that a change of name is simply a price to pay for membership of the EU and NATO.
St. Martins' watches are silent as the Harlem churches are living in difficult times
"The elderly people I've been talking to say that there was a bar or church in every corner of the street before," says Adams.
"There's neither of them today."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The interaction of people has changed."
"Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not go as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced by houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines of the neighborhood.
"Unfortunately more people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will speed up the day when these churches will close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black residence - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the merchants on 125th Street in Harlem, the central shopping street, in opposition to the hiring or promotion of these black people.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the bell game "the bell of the poor."
The expert who played the tower clock game in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that this was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins didn't replace him.
In recent months, St. Martins has developed a complex line involving architects and contractors hired by the lay leaders of the church on the one hand and the Episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, an administrative body composed of lay leaders in the Sakastia congregation wrote to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese would "try to roll the costs" to the sacris, even though the sakast had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some in the congregation complained of a lack of transparency regarding the diocese.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old lobster diver in California.
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while the boy was diving lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place in Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving with him for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought he was just excited after catching the lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "I got bit!"
I was bitten!'
After reaching the boy, Hammel says that he noticed that his whole clavicle had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water, there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be in critical condition.
The species of the attacked shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper body.
The authorities closed the beaches in Casablad from Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swam for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Mr Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's is going to be in the beauty care business of the United Kingdom.
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store style beauty care departments where expert advisors serve.
This is a major movement for the £2.8 billion beauty care industry in the United Kingdom, which will continue to grow even though the sales of fashion and household goods will decline. Larger beauty care departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be extended to other stores next year.
Beauty care products are placed because supermarkets tried to fill the shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's tells us that its range of beauty care products doubles to 3,000 products, which include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space, and they get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
The Supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique make-up range. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers demand it more and more often.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume chain is experimenting with rental shops in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition of grocery shopping to small one-time shopping in local shops force supermarkets to come up with new attractions for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that shops will look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles with low-cost stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and Habitat stores in its stores. The company says that this has made food sales and purchases profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty care and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute over how the profits of supermarket pharmacies should be distributed.
The new strategy follows a transaction in which Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
The company explained that Lloyds was part of a plan to extend the range of luxurious skin care products to four stores with signs such as La Roche-Passay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care departments to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are ready to advise customers.
Our brand selection responds to all needs and our attractive surroundings and convenient locations make us a convincing shopping destination for beauty care that challenges the traditional way to shop."
Peter Jones "clear" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in his "rare" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home supplies and accessories for Truly.
The two companies have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning program announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources tell us that Jones was in his "rare" last Tuesday at a tense meeting held at the Jones business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home and accessories label, Truly.
The company has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated GBP 11 million worth.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced his departure in Instagram from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long - term plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision to begin has left everyone amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday so close to publication.
Marlow's head office has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold."
This Morning host is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and his departure may, according to experts, cause the company to lose millions of dollars due to product placements, including everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household supplies, not to mention the delay in publishing.
It can mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby, and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
Couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will bake M&S’s new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as I’m A Celebrity programme host.
The source near Jones said the night before, "We don't comment on his business."
Hard talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media about his comments, which some would consider inappropriate to the President, and his pro-Chinese attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be an anchor.
"I didn't give up at all."
He noted Kim’s interest in seeing again after Trump’s first July meeting as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the United States 'a similar reaction' to the early disarmament efforts in North Korea.
On the other hand, he said that the United States was continuing its sanctions, which were designed to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"You're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship".
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results: the missile tests have been stopped, the hostages have been helped to free themselves and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when talking about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of trying to get 10,000 more outside this crowded hangar, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of us.
Indonesia’s tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, even though about 10 percent of Lombok’s population had been left homeless.
"In many cases they have unfortunately made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children form a group travelling to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia is still regrettably unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account the frequent earthquakes.
Although Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely lost as a result of the missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in effect.
Travelling between the numerous Indonesian islands is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship assigned to Lombok to help earthquake victims is on its way to Palau, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new area of disaster.
President Widodo made the development of Indonesia's past infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, and he has flowed money to improve roads and railways.
However, either the administration has been affected by the financial deficit, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Either the pressure is increased by the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons that have led to the death of more than 1,000 people, and tens of thousands have had to leave their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool sunk a late levelling against Chelsea.
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Champions League after painting 89 minutes on the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqir, 27 miles from Chelsea's goal when his team was in the losing position of the goal.
He moved the ball to the left before he scooped the shot towards the back pole.
The shot floated high over the penalty zone towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and the players like Shaq always play up as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea was in charge of the match at halftime 1-0 after the 25th minute painted by the Belgian Eden Hazard.
The Blues tip gave Mateo Kovacic no access in the situation before he rolled away near the middle field and spouted to the Liverpool field.
Kovacic played a quick wall feed in the middle of the field.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty zone with a great pass.
Hazard escaped the defense and passed Liverpool by Alison Becker with a left-foot shot to the back corner.
Liverpool will meet the Champions League in the sectional phase of Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meets UEFA in Europe League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths of the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832 deaths.
Early on Sunday, the Indonesian Disaster Bureau reported an earthquake and tsunami death to 832 victims.
The agency spokesman, Sutopo Purwo, reported at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when the 7.5 Magnitude earthquake struck on Friday and raised waves up to six meters [6 m] high.
The debris of the wrecked buildings spread widely into the town of Palu, with 380 000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death.
The woman's body found at Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police will ask those who were in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to everyone in the vicinity of John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to all taxi drivers, especially those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police, who may have information vital to the investigation".
Police female publicist has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, there have been people who may have known her, who have asked where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police say they're trying to inform the victim's loved ones about what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents have just learned that it can take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard to tell the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He kept repeating that he said, "It's terrible."
At two in the afternoon there were two villages in the isolated area, and outside there was a third.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone who knows anything is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or call the Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 using the code 247 30 September.
Even the Cromwell statue of Parliament was part of a rewriting ceremony in history.
To evict the statue would be poetic justice, given that his own fanatical puritan supporters destroyed British cultural and religious monuments like the best Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "stupidity" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or execute the iconoclasm of the British Civil War.
The wrong Cromwell might have to suffer for the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and is an historical proof of a figure that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was caused by monarchy in this case.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of constant historical debate.
It is certain, at least, that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the future development of our nation. Cromwell, in turn, is an identifiable figure representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve commendation and remembrance".
The killer pig broke a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media reports that a pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in south-west China.
Only the body of a man named "Yuan" was found near a pighouse in Liupanshui Square in Guizhou Province. His artery was broken and he was covered in blood, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig herd is preparing to vaccinate pigs in the pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his traveling cousin were reported on Wednesday in the nearby Yunna province with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found the door of a nearby pighouse open.
In the pig he said he saw a big boar with blood on his mouth.
According to the news, forensics confirmed a 250-pound boar was crushed to death by a farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports a cousin named Wu saying that "my cousin's feet were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera shows a cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm other police officers when gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market officials are reported to negotiate compensation for death.
Pigs are known to attack people before, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 pounds wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
After the event, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that even though pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
All you have to do is respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring extensive heavy rains to the United States southwest
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as she moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the next few days, however, Rosa will bring floods to northern Mexico and the United States southwest.
Rosa’s wind speed was 38 meters per second, a first - class hurricane, Sunday morning at five o’clock on the east coast of time, and it was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on Monday in the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern United States.
On Monday Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters [250 mm] of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the next few days, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching low pressure will create large rainy areas for the southwest.
The local rainfall of 25 to 100 millimetres causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes precipitation of 50-75 mm per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain areas of the south-west, especially Arizona, rain is expected to reach 50 to 100 millimeters.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can rapidly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
In the face of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended to avoid going to the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms create local gusts and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rain levels of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the area.
Fragmented tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October, in the United States, intense fluctuations can be seen throughout temperatures as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
A fine example of large temperature differences is seen in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowa Des Moines.
The lingering heat of the summer will once again increase and expand in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, warm temperatures are expected in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with temperatures close to +26°C from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, the temperature may ache to +26 degrees Fahrenheit [26 ° C], which would be about 4 degrees [4 ° C] above average.
Our long - term forecast is that the eastern parts of the United States have good prospects of higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Tuesday, over 20 million watched a broadcast by six television channels, where the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of sexual crimes in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies interrupted their broadcasts at the latest turn of the week, according to which the FBI is conducting a one-week investigation into the allegations on the basis of a contract arranged by Arizona’s Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100% sure that the intoxicated Kavanaugh was groping at him and trying to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony, saying that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
The number of viewers is likely to be higher than the 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels that sent the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often finds it difficult to measure spectators who watch in offices.
Something about proportions tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of people watching the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers of all television companies was Fox News Channel, which has been strongly supported by opinion leaders to name Kavanaugh. On average, the channel had 5.69 million viewers throughout the day during the hearing.
ABC was second to 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 89 million and CNN 2,52 million viewers.
After the consultation, interest was still high.
At the heart of Friday's drama was Flake.
The cameras of CNN and CBS filmed how the protestors’ screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to the hearing of the Legal Affairs Committee on Friday.
CNN showed me live how he stood down for minutes while the reproaches were flying.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he'll tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told."
Mr Flake said that his office had issued an opinion and, before the doors were closed, added that he would have more to say after the committee had been consulted.
Hours later, cable and universal transmission networks were sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh to the vote in the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said that he would only act in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority democrats have demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by the discussions he had with his friend, the democrat Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit's politics
In an interview with Prime Minister Theresa May in the Sunday Times, he blames those who criticise his EU divorce plans for a policy that threatens Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Next to May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, another interview was published in which his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan.
Shot of Waded Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect in the death of an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the LSU for shooting a 20-year-old Wade Sims who played basketball.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison and, according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he's charged with second-degree murder.
The authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, where the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, says WAFB.
The police report says that Simpson admitted to shooting Waded in interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner of the East Baton Rouge County published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The Bureau commends the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s physical trainer, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their “industriousness and justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
A six-foot attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball at LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 discballs in the match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said he was "frightened" and "shocked" by the death of Wayden.
"You're always afraid something like this will happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The volcanic ash from Popocatepetl has reached the southern residential areas of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the Mexican disaster prevention centre urged citizens to stay away from the volcano when the crater’s activity accelerated and 183 gas and ash discharges had been registered within 24 hours.
The center records thunder and vibrations several times.
In social media, pictures were published that covered a thin layer of ash in residential areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysics have found an increase in activity of a volcano 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since the earthquake of 7.1 Magnitude in Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan paratists will fight before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in a confrontation between independent protestors and riot police, and thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the divorce vote.
The police held the group of masked supporters of independence, who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, forming dark clouds of dust on the streets normally filled by tourists.
As the day passed, more skirmishes broke out as the police used their batons to control the dummies.
The clashes between the supporters of independence and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, while the former shouted 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness', and the latter 'live Spain'.
The local press reports that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
The tension is still in the zone of independence one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid outlaws, but which is celebrated by Catalan paratists.
The voters elected independence by a clear majority, although participation was low when those opposed to boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to prevent voting at polling stations in different parts of the region.
On Friday, independent groups stayed outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was arranged, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck in place," he says.
Despite the close but vital victory achieved in last December's regional elections, the momentum of the Catalan parties for independence has waned this year. Many of the most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or detention awaiting trial for their involvement in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who photographed a police demonstration on her phone, says that politicians on both sides were stirring up a controversy.
"It's getting tighter and tighter," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders who had been in detention since last nine years, announced that he would attend next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion and repression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: Men were arrested after a car crashed into a house
Men 33 years old, 34 years old and 39 years old were arrested after the car was reported to have hit a house repeatedly in Londonderry.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday about 7:30 in British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
They could have shot a crossbow at the car somewhere.
Livingston won the Rangers with a 1-0 Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston confirmed victory.
Serialist Livingston amazed the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard another defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Menga’s goal was finally enough to win as Gary Holt’s team took second place with Hibernia.
Gerrard's crew missed the first win of the season at Premiership, and next Sunday it's going to meet serial leader Hearts, who's eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet again in the Rapid Vienna European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his losing streak in the series to six matches. Head coach Holt has not yet lost once since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places to a visitor with a lack of blade.
Holt's team should have led long before they scored after causing the Rangers serious trouble with their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and next thing I know, Alan Lithgow was able to slide off the finish line to Craig Halkett's butt feed, but he drove the ball past.
The hosts willingly handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
That's exactly how the big paint came in.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free kick, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga a place to move the ball into the middle of the penalty zone and finish.
By then, the Rangers had held the ball, but found the home team's defenses to hold, and the goalie Liam Kelly was hardly tried.
The same pattern continued during the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalie Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow drove the ball past one more of Livingston's special situations.
In addition to the constant cleaning out of the concentration of the Livingston penalty area, two situations were in vainly called for a punitive kick - after Halkett's tackle, a switchman named Glenn Middleton and a hand-hit ball.
"Excellent performance from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotlann’s Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent up to every player, continuing through the upswings.
The team’s playing habits and crew have not changed much since it got back to the highest level.Holt must be acknowledged, however, for the way he has strengthened the team when he arrives.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing in leading an excellently organized defense, Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Wormall on his toes for the whole match.
But the Rangers didn't have any ideas.
From time to time, the team has played very well under Gerrard, but now it is far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team's defense once, which should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, which is the middle caste of the comic board.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne.
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between NATO allies.
There have been differences about human rights and freedom of the press as well as Turkey's aspirations for the EU.
Erdogan continued on his way to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of 25 000-headed supporters from meeting in front of the mosque, arguing for security reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters coming around to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German Government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competitive demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some of the Turks in Germany greet him as a hero while others slander him as a dictator.
Road accident in Deptford: A biker dies in a collision with a car
A biker died when he hit a car in London.
The accident took place at about ten o’clock in the local part of Deptford’s southwest corner near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The car driver stopped and the medical staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday accident site.
The city police say they're trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
There are roadblocks and bus traffic has been steered elsewhere, and drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in unrest
Prison officials report that six prison guards have been injured by the high - security classification of men in the prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 p.m. Sunday in British time and continues.
The Tornado Special Police have been brought to the scene to calm the unrest, which is caused by eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Police officers' minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
One of the inmates said: "HMP Long Lartin has sent a specially trained prison staff to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken to the police and may have to spend longer behind bars".
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was reported to have been hospitalized in June after one of the prisoners attacked him.
In addition, in October riot police were alerted to the prison for serious unrest, which attacked the staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the dry areas may benefit)
Rarely does tropical low - pressure arrive in Arizona, but that is what is happening at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remains move over the southwest desert with the risk of heavy rain.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rainstorms during Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to Southern and Eastern Nevada, southeast Kaifornia and Utah, as well as in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out in its tweet that only "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low - pressure state within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border."
The latest modelling of the National Hurricane Center predicts rains of between 50 and 100 millimetres. Mogollian ridge in Arizona can rain up to 150 millimetres in some places.
Other areas in the south-west desert, including the central rock mountains and Great Basin, are likely to provide 25-50 ml. In total, rain can be up to 100 mm.
Rosa’s rains can also be a blessing in a drought - stricken area if there is no danger of heavy rain.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains may be useful because of the severe drought in the south-west.
According to the U.S. drought agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest class, reports Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first makes a landing on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, which is still the hurricane's strength at 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be harsh and pose a considerable risk of flooding.
"From the California Peninsula to the north-west of Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimeters, and up to 250 millimeters is possible", says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical lowweight on Tuesday mornings, and from there she will continue her journey through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday’s late evening.
"The greatest risks of the Rosa or its remains are likely to be associated with very heavy rains on the California Peninsula, in the North-West Sonora and in the U.S. South-West Desert", says the National Hurricane Bureau.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rains and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British time.
He was taken to a hospital where they say he's in a "steady" state.
The police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old man in Radstock in Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are asking for contact from anyone who may have video material stored on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced the "violence and anger" of the democratic party.
"My vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeler, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that Mr Kavanaugh suffered from the 'violence and anger' of the democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, he strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's charge of sexual harassment decades ago in their teens.
Ford also testified to his accusation in the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character and courage" that day.
"My vote in favour of strengthening the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with excellent mercenaries for public service," he told his West Virginia supporters.
The President implicitly referred to the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning hard," he said.
"That's why I'm going all over to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats had taken over the task of "resistance and obstruction".
The senior assistant of the Republican Party leadership informed CNN that the first important vote on the Kavanaugh nomination procedure is expected in the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of deaths expected to rise
On Saturday the authorities reported at least 384 deaths after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many were wiped with the gigantic waves that struck the beaches.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on the shore of Palu City, when waves up to six metres high struck the beach at dusk. Many washed up to their death as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
Tsunami was caused by earthquakes of 7.5 Magnitude.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach, and they did not immediately flee, and they were the victims of it," says Purwo Nugroho in Jakarta, Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, BNPB.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, it was pulling cars, tree trunks, houses and hitting all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 kilometers per hour on the high seas before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial images published by the disaster agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a water - surrounded mosque.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian technology assessment and application agency BPPT issued a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was equivalent to some 200 atomic bombs dropped in the second world war in Hiroshima.
It says that the terrain of a long and narrow city at the end of the bay may have increased the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that some of the victims ’ bodies were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings and added that 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the casualties and the damage could be greater on the 300 km north of the continuing coast of Plus, the Donggala area, which is closer to the centre of the quake.
Communications "are completely out of line, and no information has been obtained about Donggala" says Nugroho.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, more than 300 000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the region.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticised for not telling us that the tsunami hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had arrived during the warning.
In a social media amateur video, the man on the upper floors of the building is crying out fervently for warnings about the approaching tsunami for people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach that takes buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately verify even the authenticity of the image material.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications from around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Authorities report that the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities by means of transportation machines, but those evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief operations and will remain closed until October.
President Either Widodon was to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The personnel of the World Vision Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in tent - fabric roofs in the courtyard of the office.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's really bad.
As relief teams began their dismal assignment, some complained that foreign relief workers were prevented from travelling to Palau.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and staff can only begin to flow once the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As long as the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can begin to receive international aid, but the declaration has not yet been made'.
As the second night descended upon Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members who were missing entertained the hope that their loved ones would miraculously deviate from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday the rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandno, the trainer of the Indonesian hang glider team, had trained two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that had ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, says Mandag.
"As an older member of the addiction alliance, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says that he has tried desperately to reach Palu’s competitors at the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hang gliding community.
However, there was only one grey sign after the messages he sent, instead of two blues.
"I understand that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 in connection with the ATM supplement on the Wide
On Friday morning, the thieves took $26,750 from the Brink's security company while he was completing the ATM in Newport on the Leve, a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been cleaning out and completing the ATM at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy says in the press release.
When Brink's employee's attention was elsewhere, "the man behind him ran" who stole a bag of money to deliver.
According to the report, eyewitnesses saw several persons fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Persons with information on their identity are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3600.
Kanye West: The rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "a figure formerly known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, withdrew her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously told him that the word also has a religious meaning for him, not only as an abbreviation for his professional name.
In discussing the name of the album earlier this year with the radio host Big Boy, West said, "He believes that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is "you".
"So I am you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form, Ye, which merely reflects the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything in us.
The album is mainly a question of who we are."
He's one of several well-known rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for varying degrees as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
West’s former partner JAY-Z has also sometimes deleted and restored the link line and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador, who appeared at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that "nowhere would he use an army to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, armed forces fired at a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student support and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education are driving young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of AI research.
The US should double the funding it spends on AI research as China improves its efficiency in the field. Thus says the financier and AI professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This opinion was preceded by notifications of the various parts of the US administration concerning AI, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: it is aiming to become a leading AI developer by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," says Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the probability that the next major AI achievement would take place in the United States, Lee reported this week’s CNBC interview.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publisher, who works as Managing Director at Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most important AI companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the highest ranking Othello player in the United States. Later, he was in charge of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s Chinese operations.
Lee acknowledged the previous technology competitions of the US administration, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organised to identify future visionaries.
Lee says that U.S. researchers worked hard to get public support.
"Academic influences are not taken by China, but by big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited university tops in recent years to work with artificial intelligence.
Mr Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to step up its AI efforts.
"I think that people with AI doctoral degrees should be automatically granted green cards," he said.
The Chinese Government's next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding for people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industrial and academic partners in the world, and the White House has announced the creation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA has also been announced this month for a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF, in turn, invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to set up the National Security Commission on AI has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in a referendum on changing the name of the country
In a referendum on Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to the "North Macedonian Republic", which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the view of Greece, a province called Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbour is in practice a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries reached an agreement on a new proposal for names, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the voting turnout will reach the required 50% threshold so that the result will be legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece'.
Those in favour of a name change such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the price should be paid in order to enable Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to become a member of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote in order to have a decisive impact.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the CEC, no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of those entitled to vote finally voted.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia, which would open the way to NATO and EU membership.
A 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents erected by boycotters in front of the Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join heads up, not through the kitchen door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, such as China and Russia, as part of the integration of the euro area".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of a change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" vote was "our future in the future".
The opinion poll published on Monday by my political research institute in Macedonia referred to a 30-43% turnout in the referendum - below the required level of activity.
In the second survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote in favour of the yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for a West-minded government after it took power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero in Manchester City scored the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear mark on Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory in Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his 65-minute goal look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine leader got a pass from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by storming through three Brighton defensemen.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one of the defensemen and then left behind several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty zone.
After that, he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton watchman Mathew Ryan’s goal with a shot into the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored in that time."
Sterling, however, had already given the sky blue an advantage in the champion league struggle.
The goal came in at 29 game minutes.
Aguero got a ball in the deep Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane took a few contacts before sending the ball to the back pole towards Sterling.
The sky blue attacker shoved the ball into the net just before the end line.

Scherzer wants to be a buzzkill at a fight with the Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoff fight, so why do you have to force yourself into the starting lineup?
Scherzer, who is always so competitive, hopes to take over the feeder hill in a Sunday game against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still has a playoff seam. They have a one-off difference between Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western league.
Rockies picked up at least a wild card with his 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division victory.
“Even if we don’t have a bet, we can at least get up to the feeding hill knowing that the atmosphere of the crowd and the other team here in Denver will create the most demanding competition for me, which I have encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to accept the challenge?"
Nationals has not yet published their starter on Sunday, but according to the data, they are inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
On Thursday, Scherzer threw out a training session, playing his 34th game at the start and pitching on Sunday on his normal rest period.

Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The President implicitly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the interim elections.
"All our achievements will be at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just the campaigns, but the campaigns to the full, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: 'You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, it is happening right now.
They have decided to return to the grip of power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't complain about who they harm or who they have to crush in order to gain power. That's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said that the democrats had taken on the task of 'resistance and obstruction'.
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "hate and mean and malicious and false".
Referring to Dianne Feinstein as the longest-acting democrat in the Senate Committee on Justice, the public responded with loud calls.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm waiting for a little - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I was not really surprised when my local party, Momentum activists, supported a motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm the last person in the line to be told that I'm not welcome just because we say what we think.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way only because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference stated on Friday that 'we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the eight years that I have served as a local Labour representative, the Friday size of the party council has been just that.
Now many meetings do not follow that tone of voice, and a 'kinder and gentler' policy has long been forgotten if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates differing opinions and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it suits the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom I thought I had shared a similar political vision began to expect a complete turnaround from me and statements that I would never have agreed to otherwise, be it national security or the EU internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a wave of insults in the social media, which calls for my choice to be withdrawn, for the central policy to be abandoned, and I hear that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I really know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that have been made to me are of a political nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who face sexual and racist abuse on a daily basis and will never waver.
The normalisation of mistreatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of politics in this era.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn insisted that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and every motion of censure or change in the election rules will only make the party more limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything would go well".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure of the Thatcher government to go to the single school, I have been working both as a city councilman and as a minister to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered up my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my viewpoints or disagreements with the current management.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honour, and the threat of dismissal or promotion of political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Unbeatable at Ayr block tip
The last two goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr certainly earned a victory in the entertaining Tennent ́s Premiership game of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten that hasn't lost a single match.
Great defense and more successful risk-taking was, after all, what supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
"We've been challenged in our fights and we're still invincible, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrose Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayri, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climon's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who handed over to the Warriors' game, enabled Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo grew Ayri's lead with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and succeeded in the conversion kick, increasing Ayri's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, which in the conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the gap to five points.
There was a long delay in the game when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall’s goal, which, in the conversion kick, Climo succeeded.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal, which was not successful in the conversion kick.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored a goal at the back of Ayr’s maul, who left the sideline.
In the conversion kick, Climo succeeded in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and ensnared Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
The star of the Still Game series begins in the restaurant industry
The star of the Still Game series, Ford Kieran, has been named the manager of a licensed restaurant company and is likely to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he's registered as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
"The sea belongs to us": the landlocked Bolivia is trying to reconnect with the Pacific Ocean through legal proceedings
Seamen patrol outside the naval base in La Paz.
There's a blue flag flying in the flagpoles of public buildings.
Navy bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been smeared with a slogan: "The ocean is legitimately ours.
It is our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline of the bloody 19th century resource war in Chile remains strong – as is the longing to sail the Pacific once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades when Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice's decision on 1 October after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has strong progress, unity and serenity, and, of course, a positive attitude towards waiting for a final solution," said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Many Bolivians from all over the country are following with hope the International Court of Justice’s decision on the big screens, hoping that the Hague – at the end of a tenuous debate – will support Bolivia’s position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The charismatic president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face up to the controversial battle for re-election next year, will have a lot at stake in next Monday's policy.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he asserted toward the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in the interests of Bolivia, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution of Dutch origin does not have the power to extradite Chilean administrative territories, and the ICJ has indicated that it will not determine the end of any negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICJ is only given six months after the last statements indicates that the case is "not complex", says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
Moreover, the last four years have slowed down rather than contributed to Bolivia’s intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has intercepted the question of sea connection," said Zárate.
Morales' quarreling rhetoric has suppressed the rest of Chilean goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations afterwards.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former President and the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the Court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia the "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, has used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never surrender his right to contact the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Mr Ri's statement came just before the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to reopen the deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Mr Ri said that it is a 'dream far away' to believe that the continued sanctions and opposition from the United States to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington will be wary of adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, wants a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up an arsenal that the State probably sees as the only real way to guarantee its own safety has been subject to widespread suspicion.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump Summit.
Paris fashion shows show the latest collection of large-sized hats, which will soon also be on your local street
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you do not have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 show a selection of special oversized hats that dazzled the style circles of the Paris fashion weeks.
Very impractical hats took Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino’s most striking creation was a beige hat with wide feathers, which covered almost all the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creature with snorkel and mask was more like a diving device, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion followers predict that huge scarves are appearing in the street.
The oversized hats closely follow "La Bomba", a straw hat with a six-foot cylinder, all seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
In social media, the cultine of the highly unpractical hat also swept another large creation into fashion shows – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as large as the model carrying it.
The branded orange raffle bag lined with reed was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection in Paris in fashion weeks.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: language skills are a key skill for world citizens
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been boosted by individual and communal success in sport, art, music and other community-based projects.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS), are located throughout Scotland, and aim to provide a high level of service for their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, postgraduate and higher education and world citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement tailored study content, we have seen the position of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the list for the percentage of admissions between private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade in A.
The material was collected from 74 SCIS schools. Based on the data, it was found that 72% of students with the highest grade A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French, and 63 percent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support the learning of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are valued in the same way as natural sciences (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in private schools and elsewhere.
Based on a survey conducted by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was found that 17 per cent of situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary in order to promote young people's future career development.
The more language skills are required for possible tasks, the more relevant these skills will be in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he or she will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of the career he or she has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically ahead of a multilingual person in the competition.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov, over 4 000 adults in Great Britain are unable to hold a debate in a foreign language, and the French language was the only one that was able to speak a two-digit figure of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for children today.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach languages that are supposedly important to the people of Great Britain in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite the interests of your child, there are always several language options in private schools taught by specialised teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In this time, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, versatility and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS)
LeBron's making a debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of the supporters of LeBron James' first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers ranks will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for the six games to be played before the Lakers.
"At this point in my career, I no longer need pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Trump’s West Virginia campaign time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election campaigns today in Wheeler, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote pending his election to fill the seat of the Supreme Court judge, Trump aims to increase support for the upcoming interim elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November elections.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump’s Western Virginia Wheeling event starts at 19:00 on the East Coast on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia campaign online as live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will probably take the stand on hearing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate of this week, who became passionate about sexual harassment charges, which have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote no less than a week during the FBI's investigation.
But the priority for a series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tough November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign was commented on by these five events of the following week, the purpose of which is to "wake up voluntary and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Management of Congress is so essential to his purpose that the President is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season," the anonymous representative of Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Today’s venue is Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and there may even be supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump’s second visit to West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports the Republican senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
"From the point of view of Morrisey, it is not a good sign that the President is trying to increase his support for opinion polls," states political scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows a will to fight to keep hope alive before Sunday’s solo games
After three one-sided sessions on Saturday afternoon four games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-strengthening power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players still believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where, according to them, is this success power at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead, which narrowed to four, so we take this success power as a drop," said Jordan Spieth, walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 to play.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in their sails and a lot to be encouraged by, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play together all day and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been superior from brick to green, leading by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the victory feast increased as his lap progressed as he succeeded in a critical putt to level the match to exactly four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt they used to win the 15th game was followed by a similar scream that gave the impression that he believes that the US team has not yet lost.
"You need to focus really well and just worry about your own fight," Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undeniable legends of Ryder Cup Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's special but sweet duo has won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only two that didn't do any Bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way they give and get energy from this boisterous audience, confirms that they are the favorites of Sunday. And when the sun sets at Le Golf National, there could be no other player more popular than Fleetwood and Molinari to ensure Europe’s possible victory.
I'd rather both at the same time with different holes.
However, the speeches about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren, the pimped Sergio Garcia, who was the hero of this morning’s four-player game.
One bogie and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole so deep that they were nowhere near surviving.
On Sunday, though, no one's coming to help you get out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-players are fascinating to follow from a close partnership perspective: What kind of advice do they give or fail to give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a considerable lead before the last day, but this quadruple showed that the US team has a will to fight, even though it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 before the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after they took the lead in Saturday’s four-balls and four-player games from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the victory procession from two winning Tiger Woods, and they scored a high score of four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain the victory in Hazeltine two years ago, ruled the weak US team in the morning four ball, taking the match to 3-1.
The United States were a tougher opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they could not narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk’s half needed eight points for Sunday’s 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend in Ryder Cup history, were the second duo who has won four points in the first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball ball, they then finished the super-depressed Woods and Bryson Decambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through the two games on Saturday, was sometimes very brilliant, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and fours, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested the morning four-balls, but went back to the game with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks to Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2-1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Spain in a four-ball game, and later 4-3 wins over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-player game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, the team has risen from a four-point chaser to a level when the two-players begin, even though on Furyk’s side a tie is enough to keep the victory.
True, after two days of being the second best, it may be that Sunday’s counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea 'will by no means disarm itself without trust'
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust in the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
At the UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken "significant measures of goodwill" over the last year, such as ending the nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the test site for nuclear tests and promising that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure that national security will be maintained, so under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally.
Although Mr Ri repeated his familiar complaint that Washington did not accept the phasing-out of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate issue, his statement must, however, be significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Mr Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US-sitting President and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on 12 June, in which Mr Kim asserted that the Korean Peninsula would be disarmed from nuclear weapons, and Mr Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has made an official attempt to end the war in Korea between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed facilitating the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States called for 'the disarmament of nuclear weapons first' and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals through force – even against the 'declaration of peace'", said Ri.
"The notion that sanctions will bring us to our knees is a dream of indifference.
But the problem is that our mistrust is deepened by the continuing sanctions."
Mr Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump Summit, which Mr Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings with the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "If the disarmament party were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a dead end."
However, the tone of Rin was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the continental areas of the United States was inevitable after the "bad president" Trump called Kim a "missile man" with suicidal intentions.
Even last year Trump threatened to " completely destroy" North Korea. However, this year Trump praised Kim's courage to approach the disarmament process, but still stressed that there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions should remain until North Korea gave up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that 'the strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be strong and unfailing until we prove the complete, final and reinforced withdrawal of nuclear weapons'.
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting the funding channels for the production of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missiles.
Mr Pompeo met with Mr Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly in North Korea and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsteric demands" only a few hours later.
North Korea undertook to close the missile base and the nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes 'similar measures'.
According to Pompeo, Kim means the security guarantees that Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and the move towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate course of rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will attend a course this year to increase student rest. The course is a counterattack to the university’s thriving macho culture, where students weigh a long night with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, who works in sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got an idea for the course after he lectured on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing about it now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he said in an interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, a course will guide students about how proper sleep habits support academic and athletic performances and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Harvard Medical Faculty and Deputy Director of Health Services at the University of Harvard University, says that the university ended the course after hearing how students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the study week.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students are presented a picture of the dorm room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus providing information on the effects of caffeine and light and the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second section, participants are told how long sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know that this has no direct impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all night long study marathons are still a proud subject, and modern technology and the growing pressures of students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Geting adequate and high quality sleep should be a secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety among students, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state that resembles starvation in the brain, which is why people are constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler to plan the course after attending one of the courses he taught at Harvard in his first year last year.
He says that the course has opened his eyes and gave the impetus to organise a comprehensive course for all campus students.
He hopes that all postgraduate students will be able to complete a similar study package before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to remind them not only of bedtime but also to wake up in the morning, and also to keep in mind the effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the daily rhythm, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's shot beat Gerrard's players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had another losing day when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox’s players were looking for their first win since February 4-1, which was against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt’s team, however, won this time, and Gerrard now only lost his second loss during his 18-game manager’s career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current leader of the Champion League Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and after that, the Rangers lost their battle will not even the situation.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game. Livingston has climbed to third place instead, and in the finish line is only Hibernia.
The Rangers may have other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object was thrown from the gueststand hit the head and the wound had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup where the team had defeated Ayri and advanced to the Scottish League Cup semifinals.
Holt continued with the same Liv 11 lineup where the team took the point from Hearts last week. The same strategy produced results again when the well-built lineup succeeded in chastising the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score at two minutes when Menga’s first pass gave Scott Pittman a free path to Allan McGregor’s goal. However, Pittman failed to take advantage of it.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defenseman, Alan Lithgow, was only able to launch wide into the back pole.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but in the last third of the game there was no confidence in the air anymore.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when fifteen minutes later he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
The Rangers were able to try only two goals in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly easily rejected Lassana Coulibaly's bush and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston’s goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but it wasn’t just the team’s hard work.
Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long feed tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher pitched Scott Robinson, who coldheadedly put a ball in Menga for easy goal.
During the exchange period, Gerrard decided to replace Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent in the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly’s impressive fast defense.
Livingston made the visitors play their own game again, as Lithgow and Halkett continued their long passes after each other.
Holt's team had an opportunity to raise their lead in the final moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs from doing anything before Lithgow got to his positions on the corner.
Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced by the Rangers, also demanded a punitive kick after he met Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter inventor
Next, the page from our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also the central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform scientists who seem to be quite cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really riding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
An invention that bears his name, however, still lives.
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to ‘see’ the malignant cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method is used to isolate resistant cells from the patient and to modify them in the laboratory.
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ the proteins typical of many cancers
The vaccine has given promising results in patients with different cancers.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see’ the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, the United States, describes the method: "Our results indicate that this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer and cancer of the ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West fell in the teeth of critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go according to plan.
Kanye West got some boos in the Saturday Night Live show after lauding President Donald Trump and announcing that he was running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third chapter of the evening in the Make America Great Against campaign hat by Ghost Town, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
Tonight's broadcast began with a sketch of Matt Damon making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Justice Committee, which relates to the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual harassment committed by Kavanaugh.
West's ranting wasn't broadcast live, but comedian Chris Rock downloaded a piece of it into social media.
It's unclear whether Rock's intention is to make fun of West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been mistreated by a hat he wore on the backs of his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm in the margin," West says in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "Do you want to see what being in the margin means?" and says he's wearing Superman because "then you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
According to Variety, West’s comments were booing the audience at least twice, and the performers looked embarrassed. One of the people who was present described the situation to the newspaper as follows: “The whole studio went completely quiet.”
West was selected on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West is supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA organisation, Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter: "Thank YOU FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY".
However, Karen Hunter, the leader of the discussion programme, tweeted that West "is only herself, which is absolutely wonderful".
"I can, however, decide not to be a person (by buying his music or his clothing mark or by supporting his "art"), which I believe supports and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same applies to us," he added.
Before his performance on Twitter, Rapper announced that he changed his name to "person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician follows Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then became an artist who used to be known as Prince.

A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in Eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before a court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
The actor of the throne game, Kit Harington, is attacking poisonous masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series The throne game.
Harrington, however, has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural annex, Harrington suspects that something has gone wrong and questions the means available to tackle toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, recently married to Rose Leslie, a member of the Star Guard of the throne game, admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity raises strong feelings in me at the moment," he says.
"What have men been taught about their growth in the years that have led to problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say, "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time – how can we change this?
Because young men have something really wrong."
In the interview he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the ancestors or sequels of the throne game after the end of the series next summer, because, according to his own words, he has been “satisfied with battlefields and horses”.
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which will tell about the film producer and his robber brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife, Rose, was the best that the throne game has ever offered him.
"I met my wife in this show, so it kind of gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of the love of Jon Snow by Harrington in the Emmy award-winning fantasy show.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estates in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens.
According to health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820 000 people in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through blood transfusions contaminated in some parts of China.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
One year later, however, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV transmission via sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was devalued in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to conservative values in the country, between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases are due to inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters contests the employee's leaking Republican senator's information and accuses her of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, contested the allegations that her employee had published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia’s website about them.
A Democrat representative from Los Angeles asserted that these claims were spread by 'right-wing' commentators and websites.
"Lihoods, lies and more despicable lies," says Waters in a statement published on Twitter.
Amongst the published data, it is reported that there were home addresses and telephone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of the State of Utah.
On Thursday, during the hearing of the Senate Committee, an unknown person released the information from the United States Congress regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for Supreme Court.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that according to the Hillin newspaper, messages were published by an IP address attached to the Waters office and a person belonging to the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, and the critics were also accompanied by former Press Secretary Ari Fleischer of the White House.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a congressman.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason for you to be submissive.
There's no reason to question the prosecution's motives.
The situation should be moderate and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is competing for the Waters seat in the Congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"I can't believe if this is true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Mr Waters stated that he had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they are legally held responsible for any destructive and dangerous action against some or all members of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again — an underpowered Rowan Atkinson agent parody
It is already a well established tradition to look for brexit references anywhere in a film that is tilted to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit Johnny English’s agent parody and action comedy series, which started in 2003 with Johnny English, and revived in 2011 with the sequel “Johnny English – Newborn”.
Can the tongue of a nation’s satire in the cheek become Britain’s new national export success?
Either way, Johnny English has earned his permission to fuck up again. His name tells us first and foremost that it is a comical creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
Of course, it's about the idiot secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe around the melting glamour, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that miserable one-note musician at the opening concert in London 2012.
The character is based on a cosmopolitan and mysterious worldman who was presented by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s TV advertisements that were originally forgotten.
There are moments in the latest performance.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades bruise his helmet.
Atkinson’s physical comedy presents gifts, but the humor itself seems under-effective and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands such as 007 and the dangerous task now offer humor as part of the film’s core content.
Humor seems to be aimed at children, and Johnny English's crazy-ass tinkering doesn't seem as resourceful and shrewd to me as Atkinson's silent role comedy.
The starting point that is repeated every year is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker has infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents in the field to the dismay of a working agent – which is presented as an unfortunately small role performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the pompous and pliable Prime Minister, who is already in a state of political disfavor: Emma Thompson is doing everything she can in the skin of the Teresa May parody figure, but the script simply does not give her enough space.
When the intelligence advisers inform him that all spies in the field have been exposed, someone who has already been removed from active service must be called to the rescue.
Of course, it is Johnny English who is screwing up in his own person. He spends his retirement as a fine school teacher, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble skill of spying. The subject opens up some clever jokes; English keeps the School of Rock-type lessons to the secrets of intelligence.
English is being rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will again meet his endless patient partner Bough, who is still being played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to be getting her rights.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of His Majesty to face the fatal super criminal Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is about to be manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The odyssey of English and Bough immediately turns into a farce: a twosome disguised as waiters sets a fine French restaurant on fire and causes chaos while secretly seeking Volta’s luxury hunt. The company explores Volta’s house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the perpetrators fade when the final scene comes, but despite all the lack of power and charm, the film still seems a bit made for the child audience.
You can think of the film as moderate.
While watching Johnny English films, I have come to the same conclusion: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
The British Labour Party denies plans for a four-day working week for a five-day salary
Mr Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is said to require business leaders to transfer the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
According to the plan, employees could enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘compatible’ with the party’s economic programme and its plans to tilt policy for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source tells the Sunday Times: "The review of the route should be announced before the change of year.
This change will not happen in a moment, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits in with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party undertook to support the transition to a four-day working week in its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, this objective does not receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
The Labour Party spokesman says: "Four-day working week is not the party's line, nor is the party considering such a move."
John McDonnell, Finance Minister of the Shadow Government, took advantage of last week's work conference to present his vision of the economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to recover power from 'faceless dictators' and ' speculators' of corporations of general interest.
According to the plans of the Finance Minister of the Shadow Government, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their share as a whole, as the Labour-led government could implement 'reductions' on the basis of the abuses detected.
He also confirmed the plans to put employees on company boards and to create an inclusive ownership fund that would transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to the management of employees, with a maximum of GBP 500 per year per employee in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing in the 60-minute program whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
An investigation into allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least one week in the final vote on the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Judge, and the delay raises the question as to whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for the appointment of Mr Kavanaugh.
In the 60 minutes program on Sunday, the programme correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way to the hearing... I said I've had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened when the accusations came up, and I asked him ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks cut in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"No one of the people he named was able to confirm the matter.
It's a 36-year-old matter.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York, is a music event with a performer guard as impressive as its mission: the eradication of poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now held for the seventh time, will attract tens of thousands of people to the lawns of the Central Park in New York to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real objective of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people active in eradicating poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to an event (if not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must carry out various tasks or "works", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political decision-maker or make a call, or do any other action to raise awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that we have only 12 years to achieve this goal?
Does a free concert ticket have the idea of rewarding a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one ‘clactivism’ among others — a fantasy that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has registered more than 19 million "works" for different goals since 2011.
According to it, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to announce commitments and principles that represent more than 37 billion dollars and have been used in a way that affects the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than 10 billion dollars have already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that nearly 649 million people worldwide have already been affected by the funds achieved.
The main commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the UK who are committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", which committed to providing 35 million dollars to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after 4 700 TV sets had been sent to them by activists as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British Government, donors, governments of different countries and to world citizens just like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the history of the press," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman of the Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by over 5,000 acts, which have announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the frequently asked questions column on the store's website is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen's answer: "The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks lie ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the moves against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are hosting a New York concert this year, and its star guard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
According to the U.S. Department of Home Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet as a "barrier"
According to Ryan Zinke, US Secretary of Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner, Washington can 'if necessary' use its fleet to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russian activities in Syria – at the invitation of the legitimate government – are an excuse to explore the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason why [Russia] is present in the Middle East is the transmission of energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinke said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep the shipping routes open with the help of its fleet and, if necessary, by being surrounded to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public at an event organised by the Energy Consumers' Union, a non-profit group profiled as "energy consumers' mouthpiece" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that it was one and the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as a "one trick circus number" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The opinions are scheduled for a situation in which the Trump Administration has sought to intensify the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace it with much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas.
In order to make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the 'inappropriate' Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, is tying Berlin to Moscow's leash.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the transfer capacity of the current pipeline of 110 billion cubic metres, as a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition and considers it an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," says Minister of Energy Alexander Novak of Russia after meeting US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has led to a reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella organisation, the German Federation of Industry, has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country is interfering in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the German Confederation of Industry, recently after the meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, intends to give careful consideration" to running for Presidential elections in 2020
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced that she would "think carefully" about running for president after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy at an open inquiry in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our flawed administration, and this also means women at the head of the kingdom," he said, according to The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I intend to carefully consider the nomination of President."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump during the event by saying that "he is taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump will do to our democracy," he says.
Warren has made a stand in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In his tweet on Friday, Warren wrote, "Well, I guess we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, the majority of Warren’s voters do not support this nomination in 2020.
According to the Institute for Political Research at Suffolk University and a study by Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of a senator running for office.
32% was in favour of running for office.
Several of the respondents supported the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick with a 38% share, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent democratic candidates raised in the discussions for the 2020 elections include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Mr Biden has said that he will formally decide on his nomination by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's military trauma at Donald Trump's election.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq enlisted in the military in September.
Track Palin was arrested on the night of Monday and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can well identify with other families who face the consequences and injuries of PTSD, which our returning soldiers carry," he told the audience gathered at the election event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest 'a hippo in the living room' and said his sons, like other veterans, "return home a little changed, they come back hard, they come back wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and the air force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman and domestic violence and the treatment of a gun intoxicated.
18 states and the Columbian Federation support the new asylum policy action
Eighteen states and the Columbian Alliance are seeking an amendment to the new US policy of not granting asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federations have submitted a letter to the Friends of Justice in Washington on Friday, D.C., to support policy-breaking asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions action brought in August by American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy.
He says his partner "and his sons from the violent gang" assaulted him, and the U.S. authorities denied him asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom are asylum seekers in the United States, as countries where gang violence and domestic violence are a problem at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturned the decision of the Board of Appeal of 2014 to allow undocumented migrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In his statement on Friday, the District Attorney Karl Racine commented that the new line "is ignoring the states, federal and international law for decades".
"Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle" says the "Friends of the right".
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that asylum seekers prevent access to the U.S. economy from being harmed by practice, because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and 'bring in the necessary additional labour'.
In June, the Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered entry judges to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who flee their country of origin because of persecution or fear caused by belonging to a race, religion, nationality or a certain social class or political opinion" in their opinion of 11 June, Sessions announced a new asylum policy.
Sanctuary was never meant to solve all the problems — even serious ones — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate survival efforts continue in Palu — the number of deaths found has already doubled
For survivors, the situation is becoming more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her fevery baby in an evacuation center in Palu's devastated city.
"Ambulances bring in minute by minute new bodies.
We're running low on clean water."
The residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered - down goods, and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 Magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spine and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, severe postshocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he sums up the ferocious earthquake that shook the fifth - floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says according to the Associated Press, and says that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "provoking" with propaganda announcements.
The American Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American magazine as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the American daily newspaper that praises the mutual interests of the US-China trade agreement.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to a paid annex to China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the congressional elections on 6 November.
According to the US authorities who spoke to Reuters, Trump's accusations about Beijing's attempts to intervene in the US elections mark a new stage in the expansion campaign in Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for a foreign government to distribute notifications to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an increasingly escalating trade war in which both sides impose customs duties on the products exported by the opposing party.
According to Chinese and American experts, at the beginning of the trade war, China's revenge tariffs were directed towards states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and the long-standing governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the working population, farmers and businesses in the United States. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China 'is now accelerating its provocations by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press' wrote Branstad in his public opinion paper published at the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese Government benefits from the prestigious American free word and press traditions by submitting a paid announcement to the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, there are only limited differences of opinion in the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, and real, different opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economy, because the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of the largest newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish" an article he wrote, but does not specify what magazine it is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco banishes female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the Republican top names stand behind and defend the Supreme Court’s candidate Brett Kavanaugh may, according to analysts, cause a reaction, especially among female voters, in the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been on a huge scale, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move forward in the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," says political professor Grant Reeher of the University of Syracuse in an article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday and they will not forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and spokesman for the National Reform Group, MoveOn, according to a newspaper published in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors sang 'November is coming' in protest in the Senate corridors as the Republicans in charge of the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, a non-attached political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that is true.
But it could be even greater, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans advance with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court's candidacy, in which he made his claim to sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee for NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It is not just a question of the committee's vote or final vote or whether Mr Kavanaugh will be questioned; it is a question of how the Republicans have acted and how they have dealt with Mr Ford," Guy Cecil, the leader of the 'Priorities' Group for Democracy, pointed out to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a narrow majority yielding to the latter.
According to a new poll carried out by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony is absolutely or probably not, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38% say they think that Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushes the matter forward, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one of the others, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
In front of the judicial committee, Ford gave an affidavit to Kavanaugh for harassing him while Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court revealed to him his genitalia at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet counterattack on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, has launched a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data are stored and who has access to what information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes about Inrupt's intention to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup company.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data repository" or POD.
It can include contact lists, checklists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on a single browser at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes and the required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some paid developers working with the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website. This is all available from this week on.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss with "Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models are turned upside down overnight".
"We don't ask for their consent."
In an article published at the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new Solid network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and leader of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, even after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic in view of the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the only minister of the Church of England awarded the Victoria Cross Medal, who served as a soldier 100 years after the events.
The medal of valor was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918, as a result of the attacks on the villages of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Vann died, however, the sniper was created four days later without ever knowing of the highest honor he had received in the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were exposing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is “symbolistic”; the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather’s exploit.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Colonel Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later, he plunged into the front line, and "with the greatest bravery" led to the advance of the troops before their assault on the field cannon alone. In the battle that followed, Vann took down three gun battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lt-Col Vann died on October 4, 1918, a German sniper was created just a month before the war ended.

The friends of the fight were waiting all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel showed Pipsa Pigs
Imagine a situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event will not be presented.
There were 13 matches in the San Jose event, six of which were scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in Britain.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program changed to Pipsa Pissu, to the great dismay of the viewers.
Some viewers were not really happy to stay up all night because of the fight.
One of the friends at the fight opened up on Twitter describing the game as replacing children's cartoons with a "some kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, this content was inappropriate for presentation at six o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch it to a children's programme," explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Deputy Director of Marketing and Communication at Bellator.
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that the timetables will be worked on so that British viewers can follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a retransmission that's probably gonna make the program work," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning, and we can't get the show done before Sunday, which in turn is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, the messages began to travel in one direction and the other, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to correct the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We're limiting the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, and we tried to offer our fans more and we tried too much.
This is a troubled situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
The swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize until he came to high school that "not everyone is like me".
Daley, who spoke on the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs programme by Lauren Laverne, says that he talked about gay rights in order to give ‘hope’ to others.
He also explains how winning at the Olympics was no longer so important after having a child.
Kristy Young, the permanent host of the long-term radio program, has taken several months off because of illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne’s first show, Daley said that she felt ‘less’ than everyone else when she was young, because ‘it was not socially acceptable to like boys and jobs’.
He says: "To this day these feelings, to feel smaller and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wanted to show that he was ‘something’ so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexuality was finally revealed.
The double Olympic Bronze Medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and performs in this year’s Commonwealth Games for the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences, and he wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of his falling in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – as a "come as a surprise".
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things when you're so young" – she took part in her first Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later – "it's hard to find someone of the same age who would have experienced similar improvements and hardships," Daley says.
The couple had a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – and as a result, Daley’s “whole perspective” has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning the gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley’s father, who died in 2011 when he was only 40 years old from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about the entrance tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games. He wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Only after she really stopped breathing and she was dead, I finally understood that she was not invulnerable," she says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I've dreamed of my whole life – jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympics. There's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration to his first song choice on the air — Heather Small’s paragraph “Proud” — which already aroused feelings when she was preparing for the Olympics, and which still puts her skin on goose meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half fit Mickelson bench on Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to make considerable progress to avoid the record round being left in history as an unfortunate performance.
Mickelson, who plays at a two-yearly event for the record 12th time, went to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourball and foursome on Saturday.
In general, the five-time Major tournament winner, who is the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half in the field trying to get his shot.
48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered to be one of the most accurate riders in his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National, where a long-grown roughy punishes unintentional strokes.
If Mickelson doesn't have enough resistance in the field, Sunday's ninth game is faced with the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who plays along with the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to have a streak of all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 doubles, get a flying start, Michelson’s game may prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could be said in the situation?
"He fully understands the role he played today. He patted me on the back, squished and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought otherwise, but this is how it went, and this is the solution we came up with.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more of the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which was never comparable to his personal accomplishments.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Fury says his presence will bring something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy everyone likes to hang out with," he explains.
“The younger players also had fun with him this week. It’s funny to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stakes in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows how long a leader can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that Ryder Cup’s great leadership before the last day’s double games can become a bumpy journey.
In 1997 the Danish player made his debut in Valderrama, where the Seve Ballesteros led a five-point lead over the Americans, but who managed to win with lime lines just and just by his nose and won with the narrowest margin141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds itself of how we ran a lot in Valderrama, we ran a lot in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit sparsely," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving into 10-6 lead on Le Golf National.
History will show both me and all the other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We're gonna go to the airport and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and that is all we are aiming for.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who are playing on our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his team’s players have completed a difficult field, Bjorn adds: “I’ll never lick until I fall off on this kind of thing.
Tomorrow is a completely different thing.
Tomorrow's priority will be individual performances, and then we will talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you are alone in the field, the player’s capacity will be tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be passed on to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to the airport alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing captain, Jim Furyk, will demand better performance from his players as individuals than they were able to do as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has had his last day’s turn in both directions. He was part of the team that won Brookline before he ended up a loser when the European team won “Medinah’s miracle”.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question about how captain Ben Crenshaw of the 1999 team handed out his team's ranks for the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medina.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly and put the boys in the field as we wish, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defence battle, and he is facing Rory McIlroy at the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are next in order to meet their European opponents.
"I put the team's guys in this order because I think it's carrying the whole tournament through," Bjorn commented on his dual-player choices.
Germany’s New Warship Delays Again
The latest frigate in the German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the vessel is to replace obsolete Cold War equipment, but it will not be introduced until next year because of faulty systems and explosive costs, the local media will tell.
According to a military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit, the deployment of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the new ‘Baden-Württemberg’-class first vessel has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have haunted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with an effective cannon, missile systems for the control of aircraft and surface vessels, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic signal detection.
Another important feature of the ship is its longer service interval – new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port.
However, constant delays mean that technology-driven warships – the purpose of which is said to be to improve Germany’s influence in the overseas territories – are already out of date when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
Last year, the unfortunate F125-fregat ended up in headlines when the German fleet formally refused to introduce the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship after it has been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but in the German media there has been talk of essential "software and equipment failures" that make a warship unfit for combat tasks.
Software deficiencies are particularly relevant because the crew of Baden-Württemberg class ships is approximately 120, which is only half of the crew of Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet’s ability to make subsequent updates.
It is believed that Rhineland-Palatinate, with its capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is twice as heavy as the equivalent class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag for the whole project is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have risen to a stunning amount of EUR 3.1 billion, compared with the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems with the introduction of new frigates have arisen as the German maritime authorities have recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable vessels "are running low".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time due to the withdrawal of old vessels but no new ones have been submitted.
He deplored the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates could have been used by the fleet.
The environmental organization is eavesdropping on the hidden lives of bats.
A new study in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
New research is hoped to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future conservation measures.
Research carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland is carried out to monitor bats and dwarf bats, as well as earroats and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
The study places special storage devices at important points in the area to monitor the operation of bats during the period.
Workers and volunteers of the organisation also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequency of the votes and the species at issue will be ensured by expert analysis.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report will be created in which bat behaviour can be presented in an image that reflects the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organisation’s nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how different species exploit them.
This information will help in the planning of the habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking bats and associated species into account.
The bat populations in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain have decreased considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threaten the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials and attacks on pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of the nocturnal hunting practices, their ears are more beneficial in catching catch than in the eyes.
Bats use advanced echo detection techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
National Trust for Scotland is an organisation dedicated to the protection of the rural environment that maintains more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76 000 hectares of land – and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, ramp inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue activities.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only reserve for the protection of bats in the countries of Dumfries and Threave Manor in Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species of Scotland are found.
According to farm manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and a good living environment overall.
We do not know everything about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking the buildings for bats before embarking on refurbishment because the destruction of a single bat resting place can unintentionally cause the death of as many as 400 female bats and chicks and destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Agency, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape charges against him as "value" and says that people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have taken action to sue a German magazine called Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
They say he paid the victim $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Ronaldo did an Instagram live broadcast to his 142 million followers only hours after the allegations were made. A 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the accusations and described them as 'value news'.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, fake news, five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing the claims that Der Spiegel has sued for, which they have called “unfair reporting of privacy concerns” according to the Reuters News Office.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player is demanding compensation for "spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged case is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have met at a nightclub and moved to the player’s room where he allegedly raped him anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged event and said that he was a 99 percent good guy, but whose "one percent" disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later came to a compromise because she was "feared about the possibility of revenge" and was concerned about "being the victim of public humiliation".
A 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to a contract to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus with a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "would regret forever" after the end of car production
Britain would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit," said Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He added that he considered the announcement by the British unit of Toyota to be 'concernable' temporarily suspending production in his factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
A Japanese car manufacturer says that the impact of border delays is visible as job losses if Brexit is concluded without an agreement.
A factory in Burnaston – manufacturing Toyota's Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My vision is that if Britain suddenly exits the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in the production of our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota's Burnaston Unit.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exit from the European Union as to how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini-manufacturing plant for a month when Brexit is completed.
The main concern is, according to car manufacturers, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of non-contractual Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and cars are manufactured on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disturbance at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and parts of the problem.
Keeping a warehouse for more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire factory is impossible according to Toyota, and production would be discontinued.
Mr Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is 'calibrated to avoid these checks at the border'.
"We need an agreement; we want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
"Not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, it is clear that we must be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chains so far."
Toyota cannot tell how long production will be stopped, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and works as a trade union official at the factory, says among the growing concerns of members: "The jobs lost in my experience will never return.
The government spokesman says: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting of Trump with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "be moved one more week" due to the noise surrounding the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh," the White House announced on Sunday.
Mr Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who, in turn, investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, the contacts of Trump's assistants with Russia and possible action by the President to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump is going to dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of expelling the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment of the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
Mr Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting was reportedly to have been the resignation of Mr Rosenstein.
However, at that time President Trump visited the United Nations in New York, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a hearing with the Senate Committee on Justice, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate plenary session.
Trump's press director Sarah Sanders was on Fox News' Sunday show.
When Mr Sanders asked about the meeting with Mr Rosenstein, he said: "There is no date set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week because of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at the moment.
We'll see, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held the White House press conference since 10 September.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says that the reason for the lack of press conferences is due to reasons other than the aversion to the "observation" of TV journalists, but he said: "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
However, Sanders suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president takes more questions than any president before him," he says, and adds evidence without quoting: "We have checked those numbers."
"Press events will still be organised," Sanders said, but "it is infinitely better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss them with me.
We often try to do this and you have seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week, in New York, the president may have pointed out the reason for this when performing uninhibitedly and from time to time strangely to the journalists assembled.
Minister of Health wrote a letter to workers from EU countries regarding fears about Brexit in the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland).
The Minister of Health has written a letter to workers from the Scottish health system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hope for staying in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months left for the UK to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of "established status" applications for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes: During the summer, the negotiations between Great Britain and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom government has also intensified preparations for a possible non-contractual separation.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much we appreciate the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues across and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head trauma
Christion Abercrombie, a supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, has been in emergency surgery since the team lost 31–27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennessee's journalist Mike Organ.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," says Reed.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him to the side for further assessment.
Tennesssee State’s trustee informed the WSMV channel journalist Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no record of the type/ extent of injury at this stage", and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays his first game on the team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when buying real estate in Great Britain
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when buying real estate in the UK. The extra money will be spent on helping the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in the stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year — helping the homeless
Theresa May will announce today a higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby’s efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises about cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of well-paid people.
The increase in the stamp tax will be directed at people and companies who do not pay taxes to Great Britain, and the extra money from this will be channelled into government action to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The additional fee – added to the current stamp tax in addition to the two-year increase in housing and investment housing – can be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects the increase to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which increases prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to have access to the owner-occupied housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK – especially in its capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax as a way of facilitating the purchase of first homes for young people.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct Britain's 'dishonorable situation'.
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including restrictions on rentals and the abolition of "indecent evictions".
He would also like to give more power to the councils in matters relating to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year that I was going to dedicate my Prime Minister's term to restoring the British dream – that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the UK and companies located abroad to be able to buy housing as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, having a home has become a far too distant dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Jack Ross, director of Sunderland, says that his "first goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about the challenge of raising the north-east corner of the country, and the team that keeps its home back on its feet.
Ross moved to the "Light Stadium" this summer after he directed St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“As a player, I wanted to play for my country’s team.
I got on the second team and that's it," Ross says on BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"I used to watch Scottish games with my father when I was a kid on the Hamptons, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
This kind of opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club."
Ross’ predecessors include Dick Advocates, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not concerned about stepping into the boots of his famous predecessors in a prominent company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At this moment, I'm going to see if I can return this club to the Champions League.
Based on the structure and ability of the Society, it is undoubtedly part of the Champion League," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself successful only if I could pilot the team back into the league."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's assistant manager and then for 15 months in Heats' coach group.
After this, he helped Alloa get out of the fall-out games in the third series and raised St Mirren from falling to champions during the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his player career on the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I was probably at a crossroads with my career," he recalls the time when he took over Alloa.
"I genuinely thought I was better suited to be a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a fair amount of money and enjoyed some relatively great successes.
But it can be hard to play.
A player has to deal with a lot of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running a team feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to run the team, and now I do it for a living. I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.”
The whole interview is on Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study shows
The summer heat wave has given kicks to pubs struggling with British difficulties, but at the same time has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant from CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continuous sunny weather and England's longer participation in the World Cup meant that July became a pub sale like June with 2.8% higher, while the month was worse for restaurants.
In July, the fall of 1.8% in summer sales of restaurants only worsened.
The most successful pubs and bars focused on the drinking side. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the fall in the sales of restaurants.
The pubs that are concentrated on the food side are also suffering from heat, but less dramatically than the restaurant operators.
It seems that the only thing people wanted out was drinking in their minds.
The sales of pubs and bars run by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman of the RSM company providing leisure and hotel-restaurant consultancy services says: "The results continue the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors affecting the sale of the non-home dining market.
It is no surprise that the struggle of the restaurants' chains continues, although the fall in annual sales of 4.8% is particularly painful now that the sector is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse seam for the food - centered operators, and only time will show whether the milder temperatures in August bring the much - needed breather.
In July, the total increase in the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7%, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.

One fifth of children hide social media accounts from their parents
One fifth of children — some as young as 11 years of age — hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, research reports
A study of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a growing phenomenon of ‘instagram fake accounts’
The news raised concerns about the possibility of sharing sexual palette content in accounts
20 percent of the students said they hold a ‘main account’, which is shown to parents
One fifth of children — some up to 11 years of age — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram website for the distribution of images.
The news has raised fears that sexual content can be published on accounts.
Twenty per cent of the students reported that they had a cleaned ‘main account’ to show their parents while using other private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after she ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret website.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 per cent of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to holding secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle, the "Sound of Sports" to the Scottish athletes' government
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Sports Committee and is taking part in the Annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland. Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the designation as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive international experience the athlete has gathered over the last decade.
"Eilidh is greatly respected among athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says: "I look forward to my role as an athlete's voice and I hope that I can be useful and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction."
An American athlete who won four Olympic gold medals, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and who now serves as a permanent commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient circulatory disorder in the brain.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say it's only time to tell me if I'm going to be okay and what I'm going to be doing.
This has been exhausting work, but I have recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I am working on agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertisement that compares mothers to cows shares opinions online
The advertising of breast-feeding mothers in the breast-punching company has distributed opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a manufacturer of consumer technology, has introduced a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump", which is promoted with a face-to-face advertisement that describes the freedom of the new pump for nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn, among other things, in these words: "Yes, I milk myself, but no tail" and "if you didn't notice, they're not udders, they're tits."
The chorus continues: "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused online discussion.
The 77,000 viewings and hundreds of comments on the video have caused conflicting reactions among viewers, which many say is a joke to the dairy industry’s daily ‘frightful’.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
They need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, but their babies will be stolen from them soon after delivery," says one commentator.

Another viewer commented: "I understand that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a breast pump to mothers who get to keep their babies?"
The third commentator added: "Perfect reality-obsessed advertising."
The ad also gave me defenders: a woman admitted that the ad was "funny".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product," says one of the comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and ‘know themselves as cows’.
The purpose of the advertisement is not to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced with undetected pumps in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is imperceptible to the inside of the breast-feeding vest, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balar, Partner and Artistic Director of Mother advertising commented: "The Elvis pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry to the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with the use of the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought out the incredible feeling of freedom brought out by the new pump in an entertaining and recognizable way."
Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
During London’s fashion weeks, the mother of two children performed on catwalk in designer Marta Yakubowski’s outfit using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border in silence
Despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively stable, the number of children apprehended has increased sharply, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policy introduced by the Trump administration, which has made it difficult for children to be placed in foster families.
Most foster families have traditionally been made up of undocumented immigrants, and registering as a foster family can endanger their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities reported that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy would have to give their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs authority, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for foster families for minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either foster family members or members of their households are illegally present in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminals foreigners.
So we'll keep looking for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with cases involving children, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which, in some cases, the case has to be dealt with in a court of law within one month of the arrest rather than the 60-day time limit previously in place, the reception centre’s staff report.
Many would prefer to appear through a video conference rather than in their personal case before the court of admissions.
Those who are not considered entitled to help will be expelled quickly.
According to reports published by the staff of reception centres and the system in recent months, the time spent in prison by children affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
According to lawyers, concern is particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of child desperation may be overlooked due to the large size of the institution.
They add that transferring children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are suffering from trauma even now.
Syria orders the "manning forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is at war for the eighth year.
Mr Moualem, who is also the deputy of the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegally in the country on the pretext of fighting terrorism and that 'they will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and since then, and millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy battle until all Syria has been cleansed" of both terrorist organisations and "illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2 000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and the Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested more than 1 000 soldiers in a battle-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Mr Moualem said that conditions were good for returning and accused 'some Western countries' of spreading irrational fears', encouraging refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by a political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area at the last rebel base in Idlib has created an opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia on an area where three million people live.
However, Mr Moualem has stressed that the Treaty has 'clear time limits' and expressed the hope that military action will be directed at jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Qaida-related Al-Nusra front, 'which will be destroyed'.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new government and opposition committee to establish a post-war draft Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Mr Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Be Chosen for the Second Period
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many Liberal viewers are likely to hope, the suspension and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential decision ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in the viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled by CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in prime time compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show has reached a peak on cable TV with 3.5 million viewers on the most important news nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," says Neal Baer, the main producer of ABC's Designated Survivor program, about a minister who will be president after the attack has destroyed the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked me why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade case goes, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy is doing.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the duty of a conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward's source data for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot jacket (Washington Post says "a pompous garment") and the consequences of the unspeakable descriptions of the anatomy of Stormy Daniels President Trump.
For example, I can never look at Super Mario the way I used to.
"What he does seems to be a reality show, because part of it is that he gives something to the public every night," says the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Brent Montgomery Trump, the creator of the Panttimo series, and the changing characters of the show and the daily twists of the plot (N.F.L.R.R., praise of Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a wonderful sunny day on the north coast of Kauai, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not resign himself from the programme where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

There's money flowing from the outside for a tough mid-term fight.
It is not surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania has faced a real flow of money, since the reorganisation of the electoral districts means that two candidates who have already been elected will have to fight for one place.
This newly redefined Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place in another constituency in the special elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th constituency of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The division was re-established after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old division of constituencies was unconstitutional in favour of Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th constituency has started an economic struggle in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became familiar after the special elections of the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District in March, Pennsylvania.
It had been a Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won 20 percent in the area.
Political commentators have given the democrats a fine head start.
The United States was planning to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated from its intentions.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the slight response from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and also owned the hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization Group’s management team.
Officials of the United States Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call back American diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of silent policies according to which Taiwan is no longer recognised", said department spokesman Heather Nauert in her statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic prosperity, and the corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in the efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, however, the high administrators made it clear that there was a desire to move forward and this effectively decided on speculations about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give a signal to the meeting scheduled for mid-October about the weight the administration attaches to the assembly, the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new bad messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesperson of the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the regime, who also spoke in the protection of anonymity.
History Teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is now very powerful evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported as heading the investigation into whether Trump's campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and possibly be judged by his peers.
This is a lot of ifs, and I am not saying that the defeat of President Trump is inevitable - no more than the loss of similar people in Europe.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions will determine how long this struggle will take.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable advance of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if President Trump separates Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Mr Rosenstein has been grilled since the announcement that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and wondered whether the President's inability to carry out his duties was possible.
Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent request for an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that holds President Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will end up in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of my lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table adorned by the swastika.
How could this legacy be anything but optimistic about the future?"

The Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic about the Rapid Vienna encounter
The Rangers will meet Rapid Viena in their home on Thursday, knowing that, after a tie played earlier that month in Spain against Villarreal, victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the G-block of the European League.
Knee injury prevented middle field player Graham Dorrans from getting into the field this season before Villarreal’s 2-2 game, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone for better results.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal has a good resistance,” says the 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point.
Perhaps we could have caught the victory at the end, but overall, the tie is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got started in the second and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the European League.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because their score was good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this group we can give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is good.
I hope now we can push it hard, leave the season behind and succeed."
Fear of pension savings robs women of sleep
Although the participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, few had spoken to their loved ones.
About half of the participants in the national survey reported discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only ten percent of the respondents reported talking to their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not raise the issue," says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to look after you unless you tell them your wishes in time.
Talk with the professional and family about where and how to get help, as these questions are an important factor in determining costs.
Bring financial advice to the conversation: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Funding options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-cost insurance, if you can afford it.
Draw up legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative so that you can appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical treatment and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also preparing a proxy for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to determine a trusted person to take financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to handle them yourself.
Remember, too, the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information into the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just the financial side, who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What medicines are used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
"Keep the plan ready."

The police describe the attack at about 2:30 p.m. as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, and according to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communications to the area have been cut off, the rescue authorities have received no information from the area north of Palu in Donggala, which is closer to the surface of the 7.5 Magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Key information on Plus and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Province of Sulawes, located in a narrow bay off the west coast of the island of Sulawes, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
Earthquake and tsunami struck during the 40th anniversary of the city.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coast line of the north-west part of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated 299 200 population in 2017.
The most important economic activities in the Central Province of Sulawes, and in particular in the coastal region of Donggala, are fisheries and agriculture.
The mining of nickel is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have struck several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is seismicly located in the Pacific Ring of Fire area and is often suffering from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, caused a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 states and killed 226 000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 The quake of the Magnitude struck south of the most populated island of Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6 Magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
Over 1 100 people were killed.
2010: The 7.5 Magnitude quake struck one of the islands of Mentawai in Sumatra, causing a ten - foot - high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The superficial quake struck Aceh’s Pidie Jaya area, causing destruction and panic as people remember the huge damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes struck Lombok’s tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in isolation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
The oldest son of the former governor and vice president of Alaska, Track Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by the Alaskan police, Pali, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and of preventing and resisting home violence in connection with arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial, and the bail is set at $500, reports TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "unlawfully innocent".
Palin is accused of three Class A violations, which means that he can be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation that can be sentenced to a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
Palin has not been accused of a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin’s mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaskan veteran court.
In January 2016, Palin was accused of domestic violence involving the possession of a gun under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting him in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior with a trauma-related stress disorder due to a service in Iraq.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake struck the island of Sulawes in Indonesia on Friday.
An earthquake of 7.5 Magnitude was responsible for the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications connections are down and the number of victims is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes, northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, you'll see videos from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering imposing a rare death penalty on a suspected terrorist attack by NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York City that claimed eight lives, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used the Home Depot rental car in his October attack on the West Side Highway in the south of Manhattan, where he hit pedestrians and cyclists.
According to the notification of the application for the death penalty in the Southern Administrative Region of New York, the death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed his eight victims "for intent" and caused serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to put both of these charges to death.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipovi with a 22-point charge involving eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation. Federal prosecutors typically use this crime title in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "substantial planning and preparation", the prosecutors noted and described the way in which Saipov carried out his actions "morbid, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullavic Saipov caused injuries, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliji, Herna Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", states the affidavit.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Since the last time the court of the southern district of New York has issued the death penalty, it has been a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last enforced in New York City in the federal case in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of a conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court records, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators what he was doing felt good, the police told him.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He answered a 22-point charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said that the defense was "naturally disappointed" in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, not recognition and life without the possibility of being released, is a solution which merely prolongs the trauma caused by these events to those concerned," said Patton.
Saipov’s defence had previously asked that he not be required to receive the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today in a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civil army."
The former Ukip leader said that politicians must feel pressure from Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed that she lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative lineman, said to the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would be "already out" if Farage were a Brexit secretary.
But May faces a deep-divided line in settling the challenge of remaining conservatives who were involved in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat for the supporters and opponents of Brexit and for the EU.
The supporters urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback - and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "screw off the Chequers proposal".
He suggested that Farage should be included and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd already be out," he said.
A Member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I am defending Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers proposal'.
He voiced his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight world wars to end up subjecting ourselves.
We want to set our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the idea that public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely erroneous argument."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and said to journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it and neither will the party members nor the activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers may keep their work when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said that politicians must feel the pressure if they are to reverse the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is now about trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit down, and we're here today to tell them we don't accept it."
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want the politicians who are about to turn the Brexit to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilise the army of the citizens of this country, who gave us the victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before a two - hour event in the city center.
A small group of activists waved the "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked conservative security problems they had with the party application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus and smooth border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren's seriously considering running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States says she is seriously considering the presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a masschusett Democrat spoke of his future at the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl in November, co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren has been suspected of possibly running against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was with his 36th City Hall meeting voters after the beginning of Trump's season.
One of the participants asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren said it's time for "women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the highest place."
Arrest in case of LSU Sims shooting
On Saturday, the police at Baton Rouge in Louisiana reported arresting a suspect in the Friday shooting of LSU basketball team player Waded Sims.
Baton Rouge police reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man on it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to his head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 Sports Network.
Wayde defended his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present during the interrogations, holding a gun and shooting at Waded Sims.
Simpson did not resist and was taken to the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starters last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 record balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team arrangements offer him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes’ team arrangements played an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the stake and left Hamilton almost on his own when he defended his position in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton behind to drive a team, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pit later and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a little contact and after the Ferrari driver moved reluctantly from the inner line, giving up his investment only after his two thirds of movement.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was in charge of much of the competition while prolonging the change of tires in his pursuit of a quick end and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkös.
He finally came to the pit in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds when Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me by.
The team has made an exceptional effort to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
Very Bad Body Language
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein’s claim that he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a sign of 'demonliness, evilness and dishonesty' for people.
"The one thing possible, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate the last few days, when we saw anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest," the President said.
“When we see publications and leaked things and then they say ‘can’, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document - ‘ Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.'
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak," he added the senator with moaning.
In July, Feinstein received a letter describing the allegations about Ford's Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied the leak from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not good enough for the president, who commented on it at Saturday's event: "I'll tell you, that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women and believed that the democrats were using the accusations to their advantage.
"They have decided to return to power by any means necessary.
You see that meanness and evil, they don't care who they hurt or over whom they have to walk to power and rule," Mediaite reports the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars applied for compensation for the defeat of the Elite League game against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead, thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team back to level before Dwyer restored Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard evened Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured victory.
This was the third Elite League loss of the season for the men of Adam Keefe who won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time during the season after the Giants won three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute of 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's pitch. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a tumultuous opening episode Sullivan brought the home team back to the game in 13:10 before Matt Marquardt fed the Cown goal in 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' lead for the first round when he hit his second goal at the end of the first round.
The home team gathered their ranks and Bouchard leveled again with a superior goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces, and Nielsen got to make Dundee the first lead goal at the end of the second round, and he also secured the victory on his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final round.
Giants, who has now lost four of their last five games, will be next in their home on Milton Keynes Friday.
The pilot died to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board managed to escape the earthquake
In Indonesia, the pilot has become a hero after his death in order to ensure that the plane that carried hundreds of passengers was safely in the air.
More than 800 people have died and several have been missing since the violent earthquake and the tsunami that caused the island of Sulawes on Friday.
Powerful aftershocks are testing the area and many people are trapped among the fallen material in the city of Palu.
Although co-workers escaped with their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his work station at the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in place and made sure that Batik Air 6321, which was currently on the runway, got safely into the air.
After that, he jumped out of an air traffic control tower that he thought was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia’s spokesman Yohannes Sirait stated that Agung’s decision could save hundreds of lives, as reported in Australia’s ABC News.
A helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims will increase to thousands, because the disaster authorities in the country have reported that the links with the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are incomplete.
"The number of victims is believed to continue to rise because many bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo.
Up to six - foot [6 m] waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes bring help and equipment to the area.
The 35-year-old housewife Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring corpses all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help the survivors, but we do not know what awaits us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may turn out to be even worse."
The Indonesian President, Mr Widododo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in his speech to the country's armed forces: 'I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN's reporting.
Earlier this year more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia air crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after the plane crashed into the lagoon
Representatives of an airline that crashed into the lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific Ocean, now report that one person is missing, although according to an earlier report, all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin says that since Saturday afternoon it has been unable to locate one male passenger.
The airline announced that it was trying to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information on the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane had struck the water in an attempt to land at Chuuk Airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both announced that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was over the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
According to Jaynes, passengers were able to wade on a sinking plane in waist deep water for emergency exits.
He said that the passenger crew panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors who were working to repair the nearby docks were involved in the rescue work by transporting people to shore on a rubber boat before the plane sank into the depths of about 30 meters (hundred feet).
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in the accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niugini has not been associated with the accidents.
The analyst presents a timeline for the night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded a retrial in which he was accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Attorney’s Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his cell phone to gather together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett reported that he had received the location data of several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was in conflict with his earlier claims with Chambers the night he died, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town on that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the information stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The closing arguments of the defence are planned to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions of the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hip hop is separated from the original, whose messages related to politics and social problems.
They want to return to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise of Great Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
A New York nanny sues a couple for a racist text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after having accidentally received a text message from the child’s mother in which she complains that she is “again one black person”.
The couple deny being racist and equates the challenge to "torture."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her regret when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first working day in 2016 and it dawned on her that she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, BACK TO THURSDAY," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
But then he sent a message instead of his husband to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, reporting that their previous African-American nanny had failed to do her job and had been expecting a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his workdays and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice sues the couple for severance and wants $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired to live and work in the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist claims, saying that the termination of Maurice’s employment was a well-founded solution, because they could not trust him after hurting him.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco told us in an interview with the Post.
"But would you leave your child to someone to whom you have been unkind, even if only by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco compared the challenge to blackmail and I said that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are we going to go after someone else in a situation like this?
It is not very nice," added the Investment Bank kiiri.
Although the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media, stamping out their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington’s publishers feared that the public would not identify with the talking bear
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a short time after the book was adopted, says of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the position of someone who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's funny now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
Realizing that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman for writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington, he “described a very important family member” and said that his father was silent about the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a boastful type at all," says the daughter.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you are proud of, even though it is not really your own accomplishment.
I think that's how he experienced Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye on my dying daughter's phone.
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save his life.
"Nad called and told me that the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to make it," Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said my daughter's gonna be dead in a few minutes and I have to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs used by doctors to keep his heart running gradually disappeared from his system.
He had died a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned his daughter's loss, boarded a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about the ordeal he was currently undergoing.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and my tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt tremendous sympathy for Nadia.
That now he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and phone numbers that can provide support.
Davis' son Tyler got depressed when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I would not want any parent to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile would light up the whole room."
But he quit his job before he died because he felt like he was in "darkness."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother who had taken his own life.
Davis says he's always afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent. You need to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years and he lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was depressed or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
When the children opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
He says Mark's death was a severe trauma to them, but they still have to survive: "It will break up the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But all we have to do is move on and fight ahead."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts its investigation.
'I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a limited investigation of time and scope - we could perhaps achieve a little unity', Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would 'disperse' the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
It's a question of timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans' success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the Supreme Court of the country will become more difficult.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is drawn up?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice President Mike Pence could blow the game and confirm his choice to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors are dropping in Kim's time.
According to the South Korean legislator, the number of persons defecting from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's entry into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong Seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unity and reported that defections occurred last year in 1 127 - in 2011 there were 2,706.
According to Park, the key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in the prices of human smugglers.
There's been no public comment on Pyongyang.
The majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
It is noted from Seoul that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most escape through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often they are forced to return them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, country leaders met in Pyongyang and discussions focused on the stagnant negotiations on the eruption of nuclear equipment.
This followed the historic meeting in June in which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed on a general approach towards the non-proliferation of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the United States for being caught up in sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence on the part of the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis and under such circumstances we will by no means begin unilaterally to dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temporarily unfit to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this at a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if she had behaved like this, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in denying allegations of sexual harassment of Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was emotionally motivated, and at times he almost screamed and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the democratic members of the committee without calling himself "grotesque and planned persecution" organised by liberals angry at the loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Mr Pelosi said that he believed that Mr Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent by his statements and in the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," said Pelosi.
Your fear wondered when he was asked if he would press charges against Mr Kavanaugh if his election were confirmed and if the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he won't be qualified not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's currently working on," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals.
As a democrat, your fear added that he was concerned about the possible regulations of Mr Kavanaugh regarding the healthcare reform or the Roe v. Wade case, because Mr Kavanaugh is known as a conservative court.
In the hearings relating to his confirmation, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected as a member of the court and we are expected to say that it is wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire speech in the throes of months and years of rage, and he cannot keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, don't you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her speech partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying: "You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a route of outburst of rage, although they are generally misunderstood in a fundamental way.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is that I cried speechless with rage and an older woman - a cold-tempered supervisor whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me from the neck and pulled me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they made you feel bad."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in 1987 on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the highly frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It was not a very well thought out decision," he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least needed was one more.
Someone called it 'Snowy and Seven Dwarfs.'"
Since campaign time was well advanced, he was behind the fund-raiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to male candidates, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his feelings of gratitude for his supporters, the frustration of a system that made it so difficult to raise funds for electoral work against voters and delegates, and the hatred of sexism - that he could not speak.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
"You might have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone must be beaten to obituary.
'He cried.'"
How the U.S.-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was deafening and although the fight is far from over, the break-up of the countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave his first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China’s most important export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with the new customs duties, which affect import assets worth USD 200 billion (GBP 150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded each time on the same scale, lastly by imposing customs duties on US imports worth USD 60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China has promised to respond to the United States in an eye-to-eye fashion, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world is waning for a moment.
In order to get Washington to back off, we should give in to our own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing plays his cards correctly, the US Trade War can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing inter-country dependence.
"A quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create the conditions that trigger an economic downward spiral in either country and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than the bystanders have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security's think tank.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is "ready" for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of disastrous war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and secure thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
The conditions now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Mr Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian Government would be grateful for the assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
European team confirmed Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the U.S. team’s final score of 16.5 against 10.5 on the Le Golf National course outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe. It has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn’s team reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had trouble during almost the entire tournament and he hit his starting shot in the water with the 16-hole on the par-3-track, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari shone on all tours and became one of the four players who has achieved a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth got out with 5&4 against the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen, Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter, England, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Sergio Garcia, from Spain, became the most winning European tournament in all time, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a heavy year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to have this victory.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, moved after the victory of the European team.
He transfers the torch to his compatriot, Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend at the Tiger Woods 2&1 Sunday individual competitions.
"I feel tremendous pride after defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up to admire him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds the Ryder Cup career record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who has won 14 big wins and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding routes all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a high-level game throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furyk said his team failed after the show: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pushed the European team into this morning's games.
We fought back.
Hail Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
