I just can't say anything to those who promote that theme.
But I'm not sending a message to you, but to those who are not followers of the labor camps in the Soviet Union: I'm proud to serve you, I'm proud of you, to put a threat to my status or to politics, and I promise you that I'm not going to interfere with the best interests of all people.
All right, it's the MP in Esly.
Air 38 - 17 Melelros: Unforgivable to Amatera
Though the previous two balances seem to be somewhat disorganized, it is certain that today's remarkable way of doing so would have a victory in the tennis preservative competition.
The two teams in the list are the topmost in the row in the tenties in which it doesn't taste defeat.
The bottom line, the best defense and the courage that led the team ahead, has all the right to rejoice as teachers Peter Murphy did.
"We've been tested in every competition until now, they haven't seen defeat, so I'm happy."
Robinson Christian said: "Yes, it was A's right to try the chances they were before they were put to the test."
Grant Anderson's quest for unity was won on the 14 minutes of the Grand Anderson, and he won't be able to get the credit for it, but in a moment of a competition with the season, the Scott cutter and Snow card that was given to the competition, which was given to the competition for the action, it's probably impossible to get the best results from the Gussononono.
About half past the time of the war, he was leading a thousand men into a florist, and by the time of the end of the break, he was able to win 17-5.
But in the second half, Melros began well, and Patrick Anders ’ efforts were put forth to take the bus to their destination, so they could turn the scores into 5 points.
Since the Arida Note was seriously injured, a long-time game ceased, and the race was restored, and the central Macorov's attempt took place.
Then, in a thousand of the pilot's ice card was given, Bruce Collein couldn't afford a chance of reaching the size of a heavy stress pressure.
Maxwell made a quick attempt back at home, but at the penalty line, when we received the five-foot card for rejection of the evening, we were able to move forward to a thousand minutes ahead.
After the rebellion was resumed, he was able to reach his goal again, as before, in the box from David Armstrong, we took a rock from Kimrow and sent Henry, who had passed by to the district of Hole for the fifth attempt in the Home of Homemor.
A buy game star for the possibility of a restaurant industry
And it's the way the world is equipped to perform in the hospitality industry, with a set of security projects for a student's licensed game star key, for which there is a licensed restaurant company.
This fifty-five-year-old star is playing a character Jatsin Jatschin, in a popular bibly film, presenting his long-in-law, Grimfer, as his promotor.
This star's 9th Series will soon be coming down, and it's the last season of the show, and I think it's going to be a busy scheduler of life after Crazy Lampe.
According to official records, he's the director of the Adrifttminmmonitor.
Tarek didn't want to comment on the news, but the signal from Scottishson's source, that Glass's way of paying attention to the Randandar's "Randandant" trade.
The sea is ours, we hope that Bolivia, will open the path to the Pacific Ocean.
Botans carry patrols in the La Paz-Corgnamnave station.
An oceanic flag is rocked at government buildings.
It's been adorned with a slogan from Titcca to Amsan: "As for ours, the sea is ours.
It's up to restore it."
Throughout Bolivia, where land had been closed, it still remains a quest for sailing ships across the Pacific Ocean.
It's been in vain for over five decades now because Bolivia has been looking for a verdict from the international court of justice on October, and for the past five years, it has been taking counsel.
"Solivia now has a spirit and a calm, and with good result, the country is definitely expected of its end," said Bolivia de Ceplodottodo Chadodo.
It seems that many Boliviaers and many of the big screens throughout the country will be judged by the opinion of the ECJ, and they hope to view the claims of the godly Triblorian Bolivia as compassion for what is going on in the decades as a whole, and then they think that they're concerned about refusing to allow it to take place in the middle of the ocean.
Bolivia’s influential local president, Ario Morrows - and the year - will have to deal with the controversy against the reorganization of the next year - Monday, and there is a lot of hope for the fate.
In August he swore we'd be closer to his return to the sea.
According to some who analyze, the court will not be ruled in favor of Bolivia, for when the court speaks in favor, nothing will happen.
Based on the Nerret staff, this UN body has no authority to make a decision between a subject inside some Earth's Earth's atmosphere, and is determined that the outcome of events is not determined by the outcome of events.
I've heard the final hearings say ICJ's ruling was in six months, but I've been informed by some of the international expert's statement that the case wasn't right.
Because of the past year’s developments, Bolivia’s objective may be to move forward.
"The Bolivian government has given birth to the Bolivian government on the problem of entering the sea."
Perhaps the most effective form of vaccine against Moraralli’s, left some a good perspective on Bolivia, which they may have.
Bolivia and some of her classmates will spend some time having discussions, but making discussions after that will be difficult.
Since 1962, both countries have not held each other's positions.
The decision of the court was extraordinary, for the former President, Edward Rodgersvesves Selveszes, who rejected the idea that the decision of this court was fast.
He said that Bolivia will receive a wonderful opportunity to end up a new era of 139 years with the benefits of certain relations.
Sea problem is being made a walking stick for his political profit - Morores - yet he is one of the most popular presidents of Latin America.
"Never give up Bolivia's right to get access to the sea bypassic means."
"It's a chance we have a car to overcome the past."
Nuclear energy will not come to North Korea until U.S.A. can be trusted.
The National Accompanied minister of North Korea said that the nation would not undaunted by all who could believe Washington.
On Saturday, the United Nations General Assembly was talking on Saturday.
He asked the United States to be willing to carry out their promises at the peak of the enemy nations in Singapore.
In Singapore, at the end of the three months with Mr. Kim Jingen, North Korea, the state secretary of state secretary - general was beginning to try to resume nuclear policies that had stopped.
Said U.S.A.'s objection to the declaration that the Koreans will end the Korean war was only a dream.

As soon as you arrive at the High Street next to you, display the biggest hat collection in Paris fashion.
If you want to cover the hat or cover the boat fully, then you won't seek other.
Waintonno and Tunununu, designers, put out the line of over-extended hats that appear to be madness for their SS collection in Rwanda.
The hats that seem to be totally harmless have conquered this summer, yet these designers have driven their eyes to the repertoire.
The Vanina's master was the piece of his hat, with large silks on their head like a swamped feather.
These hats are not designed to warm your head, but they are not designed to warm your heads.
A piece of strange faces reveals a toucule tou Braun, which is easy to use.
The faces of many of these appealing colors are shambled, and these masks remind us of rather than borbalts.
A complete schoolboat with a sponge and gongs made him think of something else like that of ice cream.
If you're in a big fashion, you're lucky.
Steam answers that these big hats are soon to be found in the shopping stores you live in.
The big hats came in, taking the form of 'la bomb', it was wearing a two - foot - wide - edged hat, all wearing it from Rahina Rajoriski.
The following are just a few of the most practical hats behind the social media, Lablil, for another huge creation, the St. St. St. Peter's grave, and the models put on the post.
The La Rivieras in the Paris fashion team were created separate from the 18th, with the top - armed bouleved borrows cut off its upper arm, and then cut off the bouleved borad oranges.
I hope I'll see the high top cap and the beach hats in the next summer, because it's really a big impact, so I'm afraid that I'm not going to have to put up with high-level suits, so I'm not sure that I'm worried about being overtimated.
John Edward: Global citizens Need language skills
The Academy of Educations in Scotland keeps a track of the Academy of Academys on a track of special trials, with a set of 2018 results, it went on to physical, music, secular work, and other university studies.
These schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council of l.C. (S.S.) and are taught to teach more than 30,000 students from Scotland, offer the best degree of services to students and teachers.
High education and what they have chosen are the targets of free school students as global citizens.
We see that present - day languages will continue to be loved and devoted to the purpose of creating and planning a unique school project.
Nelson Mason said: "If you speak to a man in a language, he'll get on his head.
But as he speaks to him in his mother tongue, he goes to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that when her relationships with people from other countries want to be with them and to gain their faith, English cannot depend only on English.
This year the recent trial results, and we see that languages are now at the top of the leaves with the highest success percentage of free people.
A total of 68 percent of students educated in foreign languages received the grade grade.
The data collected from the SIS4 schools of the SMS and 72 percent of the educated in Mandar, 72 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages with vital skills that will help children and teachers in the future.
In other countries and elsewhere, as subjects of Steam, technology, engineering, mathematics, and mathematics, languages are now being discussed.
One survey of employment and skills found that 17 percent of the reasons why there was a challenge to obtain excuses were not in the absence of language skills.
Thus, language skills are more essential to preparing students for future employment.
Since languages are necessary in regard to future employment, these skills are not being shared in globalized world.
If the graduates have studied a second language, they will have real confidence in the future, since they will have a long - term skills like that.
The ability to communicate directly from foreign countries will naturally make the person who knows more than one language to take the lead in the rebellion far ahead.
According to the results of the June 22, 2013, more than 4,000 adult voters, 75 percent said that they were missing from the country to speak a language that was less than 15 percent.
That's why they're depositing their treasure to the language teacher... that's why children today are so important.
Learning more languages, especially in developed countries, will give children an opportunity to find a truly satisfying job.
In Scotland, every school teaches different languages.
Other languages will be taught that when a handful of schools focuss on the more modern - day languages, such as Mandino or Jappaño, it is the spoken language that will be considered important to the United Nations.
And whatever your child is interested, there will always be languages for choosing independence schools in the foreign language.
Although we don't know what the future holds, the Scottish schools are dedicated to providing students with the skills needed to succeed and with the skills needed to win their children.
A global business environment doesn't deny now that language is a vital element for the future of the country, so it must be repaid in education.
Of course, modern languages must be treated as foreign skills.
Free schools continue to provide this choice, variety, and variety for their young in Scotland.
I'm Finda Fer. Bien.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Freedom of Schools.

It's at a bill at San Joe, which is 13 times the 13 fights in the main card, which shows the times of June 5th.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, the audience of the UN was shocked when Güngford and Rossamar were transferred to the Pentagon.
Those who waited till morning to enjoy the battle were utterly disappointed.
One of the people who spoke of the Twister that moved to the cartoons and said it was such a stupid joke.
"Now that the staff is in control, it's not appropriate for them to broadcast the content at 6 a.m." they had to move to the children's program, and they asked questions about the transmission of the attorney market and the media, and they said, 'We're all part of the country where we are.' "

"But it's six o'clock Sunday morning, and we can't solve this until Sunday, Monday, and their time.
But we're trying to solve it.
Believe me, many text messages flew back and forth, but they were not friends.
We were trying to solve it, but we at first thought it was a technical disaster.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
We spent six battles in five - short as we did normally, more than we paid to the audience.
This is a unfortunate situation. "
Dessert Island Street: Tom Daly felt that you had an urge to have sex with your parents.
The Olympic expert Tom Daley says he's raised in a more low feeling because of his sex.
Twenty-four-four-year-old said he didn't realize that you didn't like me until he went to the Seventh School.
He spoke of the first radio presented by Lauren Laveton in 4 Dessand Islands, and he spoke of the homosexual rights of others.
He also said that a Lord is going to win the Olympics.

Dare sat as if on the first program Leveton's first program, Daly said that he felt as if he didn't approve of the community of both boys and girls alike.
He said: "The feeling of being inferior to others makes me feel different and has given me the strength and strength to win to this day."
He said that he wanted to prove what he was and that he finally learned about sex and that he was not disappointed.
Daly, who has won the Olympic Games twice, has now become a big Elbiba. He has used his presence in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to additional countries for further legal recognition.
He said that he was so lucky to live in public without any adverse consequences that he said he opened his mouth to others for hope.
He said three times, the U.S. champion da Daly said, "I was surprised to see that he fell in love with a man he met in 2013.
He said that he married Karina, aged 20 years older than he was, but the elderly man was never a problem.
"When you were a little too young when you were at the age of 14, he was the first to rebel in the Olympics, and he said it was difficult to meet a man whose father died three years after the cancer of Dain's death - like those who had suffered a similar loss of humility and humility.
In June, the couple became the father of Robert Ra's son, Reindley's, and they said, "The whole vision has been changed."
"If you'd asked me for the last year, I'd have spoken with regard to the fact that I have to win a gold medal."
"You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympics are gold medals."
After finding brain cancer, in 2011, at 40 years of age, Daly's father, Robert's son, was born.
When the father finally asked if he would never agree to die, he said that there were tickets to London for 2012 left, because Daly said he wanted to see her back in groups.
"But I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there until the time he's sitting on the top, he said.
"I took hold of his hand until he took his last breath, when he actually stopped breathing and died, he was the only one I finally accepted."
The following year Daly has fought in the Delhi Olympics and won the VW.
"I knew that I had dreamed this whole life... and in a Olympic Games, I had never had a better feeling to dive in the face of the people of my country," he said.
It inspired him to choose his first song and choose his sunlight, to the Olympics, and he still remembers this song when he hears it.

Showing confidence in his player, he's not saying anything else to say.
"He's fully realized what he's going to do today, and he told me he'd be ready tomorrow, if I could catch him off."
He's very confident about you.
He's been away recently, and he's contributed very much to these teams every week.
I didn't imagine he would play two tasks.
I've imagined more, but that's how it happened, that's how we thought.

Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow is a very different thing to do.
It's a pleasure to be with a partner when it's okay, but if you're alone in the course, then your strength will be tested as a golf player.
That's the message you're given to the players, that's what will be the best we've got tomorrow.

The new war commission of Germany has been restored again.
The German fleet for the Old and Cold Warship for the oldest warship in the Cold War had to be held in 2014, but the problems and expenses of the problem are reported by the local media report.
D.B.D.R.L.D., D.D.'s licensedjar, the 2rd ship ship for the New Badams class, is resurfaced by the DMZ, and it is reported as a DIGHT report on the military speaker's reviewing the first half of the 2019 warships.
The navy had to have received this ship in 2014, but the most proud plan had an impact on the victim.
An old man, Bremens-class troops, power troops, for use of the warships of battle, issued by four-year-oldton University in 2007.
These ships are aware that a very powerful cannon, a aircraft, a fleet of spirit mediums, a ship's missiles, oil tankers, and anthropic cigarettes.
Another important feature of the long maintenance of operations is, therefore, that the motherland will be able to launch new warships until two years away from the ports of its homeland.
However, by entering the continuous phase of operation, these new machines with modern technology are thought to be extinct; these ships are said to allow German ships to express their power in foreign lands.
After the last decade, the FF2 warships of war had arrived in the media, and they were not noticed when German sailors officially rejected shipships and sent back to Hamburg and Shipper Yard.
After carrying the delivery and returning to Ordaman, the first of the fleet's record was the first incident in the history of the fleet.
No one knows the reason why the ship was sent back, but the US press reports that there are a number of important "softweedter, Hardweeds" ships, and that the war mission does not work out.
Soft feelings are particularly important because some half of the former Bremenn Class-Bourtan Wars are in control of a group of over 120 sailors who have been working on warships.
Moreover, the ship’s ship is too heavy for its ship, reducing the weight of its ship, has high enough information that ships are capable of changing the future.
It's believed that in the second world war, there are 7,000 tons of gas, twice as heavy as a ship like the rest of the war of Germany.
If you change the wrong hardware store, the entire project's funding - including the crew's training - becomes a problem.
Though it was hoped that the initial cost would be $2.22, it is said to have arrived.361.
In recent warning, the ships of Germany are particularly important, for the most recent warships are the most important.
First this year, Hans-Hepper Barts, head of the Defense Department of the German Parliament, admitted in the navy that there were no truly enough ships.
The authorities said that problems are becoming complicated because the old ships are devoid of new ships.
He felt sorry that none of the new Badon-Birmin’s warships were of no use to the sailors.
National Trustal Trust noted the secret life of bats
To find out how to hunt for food, it's targeting a new setting at an estate in the mountains of Scotland.
It is expected that finds will benefit from obtaining new knowledge of the behavior of these flying mammals and helping them guide their steps in the future.
In the Inverve Gardens, West Rose, studies for researchers are studying common bats, physicratic bats, cypressanton bats, and bunnunte bats, who have long ears filled with gaurants.
During the course of the season, special records will be placed around the estate to track bats.
The mobile survey is designed to provide information on how to use the DNA statistical systems that are available in their hands and in their hands.
The preliminary analysis of all recordinggus helps us to determine the precise timing of the tail cycle and to know the sound of what kind of vandals are.
Then, a detailed designal map and report will create a detailed picture of the earth-view of bats' behavior.
The environmental author of theEE board hopes that the results of this survey will be revealed as well as what are the most important areas of their habitat.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the care of the environment, such as creating grass, creating leaves, and caring for the very best of trees.
During the past century, bats have been particularly low in scale and have a low rate of bats.
Bats are threatened with the destruction of this system of things, such as buildings and development activities that affect the depression.
Airlines, electric light, steel paper, and the chemical compounds are threats threats, as well as attacks from environmentalists.
Their tails are not really blind.
However, in the habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in catching.
They use very complex or virtually all accessable technology to determine the true dangers and obstacles of flying course.
The Entracks responsible for 77,000 gardens and land-based history of the country are seriously considered.
There are ten well - trained experts in this institution, which constantly surveys, tests, and sometimes rescue animals.
It's the only dedicated tail in the Third Reich of the Third Reich is opened, at the St.
Etret manager David Thompson says it's an ideal place for insects.
"Here's room for bats in the Trives," he said.
"There are old buildings, many bigger trees and good habitats.
But there are still many unknown things that we do not know about here, so we can learn more about our activities here and in other instances that there are so many things we can do to help us learn about as many things as possible."
He stresses the importance of examining bats before they fix their buildings, because by mistake, 400 female bats can be killed and sometimes destroy all local bats.
It's illegal to kill or harm them or destroy their nests.
The Scottish officer of the battery-consistence trust, Elizabeth Ferrer, has asked the public to help him.
She said: "We still have many things to learn about our bats, we don't know how many bat species there are and how well their numbers are increased."

After the accused has been accused, Ronald may have fallen to his knees and he claims that he's an 99 percent "1 human" and that he's a 1 percent "one" lied to him.
Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex with her, but the records claim that it was unacceptable.
Margorg claims he's gone to the police, and he's taken the photos of the injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to a settlement outside the courtroom, 'cause he was worried about whether he was humiliated and he was insulted.'

They then directed that the media and trucks be used directly to communicate.
"President handles more questions and decisions than those of his predecessors," and says, "we've looked at them with no proof."
The press will still be standing, Sandersson said, if you have any opportunities to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's better to talk to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot longer and you've seen us doing it for the last few weeks, and instead of making a press conference, you're gonna be gonna talk to the president of the United States.
