Welsh Ambul members worry about sitting like 'Widdy'
Some ambient members have been influenced by the intention of changing their status as the 'M Winners' (a member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal arose because the name of the Amemble was intended to be renamed as the Welsh Parleyment.
In various political communities, members of the Ambulators are concerned that this move would invite ridicule.
A member of the Labor Party said that his party was worried that the name was "integrated by TWP and PWP".
To the author's knowledge outside Wales: in Wells' 'TradeWP', but the PWP is meant to be stupid and to be plum.
A PDP said that they were not in the full group and that they had suggested other names in the group.
His group in relation to the name was "subjected", but it was closed to the word McPati in the MTP.
In this case, the Welsh character U's pronunciation is similar to that of Shanar English pronunciation.
The Academic Commission, which has been set up to bring the name, stated: "The final decision to call on members of the community will be discussed among members."
The government of the Welces is a 2017 to the Welsh Award.
In June, the results of public opinion were published by the Commission, and it was received from the public an extensive support for calling the Welch Parliment.
In connection with the status of the Academic members, the commission was supported by the parliamentary members or the WTIMPs, but the public said the public was the most supportive figure in the survey.
It is evident that members of the Amblim are specified by other names, but the struggle to reach a contemporary, and the conflict with the Prepermitation officer, Eli Johnine, is expected to have been present within weeks of the law about change.
Other changes associated with the Association of Civil Rights, including the constitutional and the design of the Association of Communitys, will include other changes related to the function of the Association of Affairs.
When the law is discussed, the Amblimary members will receive the final vote to question what they will call them.
Macedonia was eager to vote in the trial of the population related to changing the country's name.
The voters will vote on Sundays to change their country's name as "Rapic of North Macedonia".
This popular poll has been designed to resolve a long dispute with the neighboring nation Greece for decades, which is named Macedonia.
Athens long ago emphasized that the name of their northern neighboring country represents a claim on a land of their country, and that Athens was constantly denied the request of that country to become a member of the European Union and Nato.
The Macedonian president George Ivanov, who was opposed to the title, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who support the Democratic test, including Prime Minister Soran Savov, argue that the price that is due to being a member of the European Union and Nato.
The churches of Harlem are suffering as church bells in St. Martin were silenced.
"It's historically, I've talked about the old people who said that every corner had a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no two for this."
He says that the bars are gone.
"In this time," he said.
"There are no lives in the bars for going on the usual way to the people."
In the case of the churches, he is worried that money from selling property, as long as the leadership is expected, "they will return to the left place as soon as they started."
He also added that the apartment building building with the type of staff that could not help the rest of the species remaining in the area.
"The majority of the people who buy the rental rooms in this kind of buildings will become white, so that all churches will come together together, because it will not be easy for most of these people to be members of the church."
Both churches were built by white churches, Harlem became a black gray and later became a Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin was the last ten years.
The first medieval Church of Whites moved from here in 1930.
The Church of the Blacks, who had been worshipping next to him, called the building their own.
The church of black people under the Rover John Howard Johnson was captured by the Church of St. Martin John Jones, and the leader of the 125-year-old merchants in the street was John John John Johnson, who was also the chief streetkeeper, and had been encouraged to set up the main streetkeepers in Harley.
A firefighting building, which had occurred in 1939, was damaged, but the plans were made to repair Father Johnson's parish building, and they also performed Careon's Commission.
Father Johnson's son and son, St. Martin's successor, Representative David Johnson, was called "the church of those who belong to".
The expert who read Carvalon read in July described it as something else: "A cultural treasure", "a historical instrument that cannot be disbanded."
For the first time in the world, it was a blackverter who was the first to read it and said that it was the Typhinian NG from the University of Mitchagon.
Mr. Mere Verdner said he could not replace him in the church of Saint Martin.
The complex story of the architects and the contractors has been heard in Saint Martin for the past few months, and some of them have been a member of the church's album, bringing up Episcopal form.
Vestriti, a member of the parish's control body, wrote about their concerns in July, although Westritics did not have any connection with the contract that had been sent out to the architects in the form, the theme was that Vesricks was to be given in the letter.
Some parishes complained that the lack of suntimism was on the part of the formation.
The shark injured thirteen of the Lobster Diving in California
On Saturday, the first day of the season, the authorities said that the shark was attacked by a thirteen-year-old man who was drowning in the sea.
The attack occurred in the Beckons Beach of Escantas at 7:00 p.m.
On Sunday morning with his friends, he had heard a boy screaming for help and his friends came to him and pulled him out of the water with his friends, and said that he was taken out of the water with the KSU B-TV in San Diego.
The first time I thought the child was making a sound, but 'I've got the bite!
And that later, Hamel said that he was crying that I got the bite.
"All his thighs were torn open," said Hamel, when he got the baby, he said.
"I called everyone to get out of the water and said: 'There was a shark in the water'," Hamel added.
The child's flight led to the San Diego Raddez Hospital, and the hospital authorities say the child's status is critical.
It is unknown which is the species of shark responsible for the attack.
The Life Guard told the media that he had seen a shark in the area a few weeks earlier but that the shark was not part of the dangerous species of the shark.
Giles also added that the child has injuries from the upper part of the body.
For the investigation and safety purposes, authorities have closed access to the Poono Beach in Kassabla for 48 hours from the University of Nevada.
Gilles noted that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but they are not considered as dangerous.
Ceinsbury to catch the UK WV.
Seynes prepares to fight the brands of boots, superg, and Debenhams, who have hired Specialist supporters to work.
As part of UK's$2.8 Billion's quality value value, the state's main focus is to open 11 stores of the state's bureaucrats and 11 stores, and if this becomes a success, it will be opened in more stores for the next year, and I'll be able to open the state's capitals capitals in more fashion and markets, although the market of the market is in the market.
The investment of the beauty field is part of the effort of supermarks to take advantage of the platforms used for TVs and microscals.
Censusbury said that the number of genus products would be doubled by a total of 3,000, and the first of these products would include the renov, SC, Tweserman, and Dr. Paulau.
The current product column, such as Lorenel, Meblin, and Butt Bes, will also receive more and more space with similar brands.
Supermarket is again presented with the Botik Mechanic Machine, the majority of the products are friendly, and the young marketers demand more of these products.
In addition to this, Perinsbury will be allowed to test the franchise shop at the Purchasbury Stores, which the first week is opened in Croidodon, London, the first week after, and the second year will begin to perform the cell in the cell at Birmingham.
It is also seen that online shopping and local Consistence stores are now taking daily food-stores, which means there is a need to do a lot of things to persuade people to visit supermarks.
In the way Supermarket networks are fighting against the outside-of-the-fundament institutions, such as non-election services and non-elections, Zinsbei's executive Mike said that they would be like a preliminary department store.
The Seinsbury is opening the outer layer in hundreds of stores, and has revealed many of the stores and the Habatatat Streets, and says the company is saying that the two networks have been occupied two years ago and that it has taken advantage of the networks to sell it to many other stores.
The previous failure by Supermarkets to renew the Bureau Department and the Fanysey Department was a failure.
In the early 2000s, Simpsberi was tested by a joint project, but this cooperation ended in debate about sharing the income from the Supermarks.
The new strategy is being replaced by 281 stysbey's Stores Fermersyo, which is the owner of the Lloyds Famcicy Network, which is sold three years ago by the 3nd Â£12 million.
The company added that Lloyd would play a role in the project, including the cost of the La Rod-Pipie and Wikie in the four stores.
Paul Mil-Huke, the Koinsbury of Seinsbury, commented: "We have changed the makeup of our bureaucrats in order to improve the atmosphere that is available to the communists.
We have also made great investments in order to serve the volunteers who have trained mainly for advice and suggestions.
The effort of our brands has been designed for all the needs, and meaning that the old style of shopping is to challenge and avoid customers."

The idolical events that occurred during the English Civil War were never in accordance with the command of Crowell, nor did Cromwell do so.
The wrong crosswell is now sacrificed for the events of Thomas Cromwell, his former successor in the previous century.
It is also the part of the history of a leader, Sir William Hammo Croft, who has been inspired by the creation of the nineteenth century and who still think that the evidence of the opinion of the nineteenth century over Cromwell is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Gold Mitttt said to The Sunday Telegraph: "As his only child reigns, he is the one who guards the race from external powers, rather than against the end of the nineteenth century, but many were considered to be one, one of them, one of whom was considered by many as Crowell.
It is the subject of the ongoing historical debate.
The conflict that arose in the middle of the seventeenth century was that one of the two groups that represented the development of our nation in the period of time, and one of the two groups that were divided, is the individual leader of Cromwell.

When the police used the lava to control the fighting, the street was flooded and pushed down.
When a number of hours of slogans called that the freedom supports are "no more, nor will it be forgiven," the Union protesters called the opposition phrase "Let Spain remain".
The local media reported that the treatment for the fifteen persons who were small injuries in the protests was provided.
On October 1, Madrid announced that the refractation was illegal, but Katentans who supported the Wikinews celebrate the conference and continue to rise in conflict with the free-minded fields after one year.
Although the majority of voters were supported by free votes, the number of votes were very low because the majority of the protesters had left the votes.
According to the statistics of the Katalan authorities, almost a thousand people were injured after the year, and they were injured in the conflicts when the police tried to stop the massacres throughout the area.
In order to prevent the performance in support of the national police, the forces supporting freedom throughout the Friday night were camped.

The dollar was led to the success of the first gol team for Liverpool.
The Rangers' Liverpool was shocked by the second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibbec Club.
When Holt's team took the lead and Habertan became second-placed, it changed to a different globe of the Dollar Megg's.

In the meantime, their single-story leap in the division has spread to six matches, Lyveling Ston, former trainer Kenney Miller's last month's career has not yet tasted any defeat.
The best opportunities offered by the visitor team were wasted by Lyveling Stone.
Holt's team had to be very front before they could get to the goal, because their direct move gave Rangers all the trouble.
Although Scott Robinson had beaten the rebel team down to the face, the goal of the goal of the Gol's face was wasted, while Allan Baldoo turned to the goal of the goal of the goal of the goal of the Gol.
The hosting Liveling Stone, whom we know to be able to confuse visitors through their performance in the field, must be said to be content with allowing Rangers to play in front of them.
And that's the way this important goal will be born.
The Rangers submitted a freekey, then Liveling Ston tried to make an overwork, bringing the ball to the Maine and Robinson, and won the ball from the middle of the box.
It was the most time in that period that the ball was owned by the Rangers, but the host's resistance was to be broken, and the Gollie Kelly was waiting for the net to be steady.
Even though Alfa Mollese had the Pasty Ball Kelly's condition, the method remained until the second half.
Scott Pitt also tried to set up the club, but the Rangers did not bow down, although the ball ran out of the open field in Liverpool style.
Although the Cross was constantly coming to the box of Liverpool, it was all wasted, and all of it was rejected, and the two Penal claims that the handball had been accused of showing Glen Mittttt, who had come to replace him.

The Alaska Demont of the BBC Scott Lion at Tony Korena.
An Ithhazika performance and the result of Livigstun.
By continuing to overcome the expectations in the distance above, they were strengthened.
After returning to their destination, the game style or team was changed in a rare way, but it should be praised for having shown Holt McKee as a team after his status.
Holt had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket took out the seat in the positions that were set up in the defences of the Mikawa, and was able to maintain the Scientar Gold Sale and Joe Worril throughout the game.
In addition to the superior Rangers, there was a lack of motivation.
They played greatly at the time under the Jeffard, and they have gone very low from the level.
They had no Finnish capacity, only once they could reach the guest team's goal to face, and the Rangers are a warning for this match because they are now below the point.

This is a rare phenomenon that has such a tropical warming over Arizona, but the following week, when the power of the rose storm remains to the south, this is what is going to happen.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Service has already issued a warning that the flood will occur, including the city of Phoenix, the Flag Staff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, from West Arizona to eastern Arizona, Nevada, to the south-west California, and to the UK.

The wind force will decrease as the storm reacts with the cold water of the Pacific.
Therefore, it is expected that it will reach Mexico's land, with the strength of tropical wind in Monday or evening.
The rain will be heavy in the parts of Mexico, and this creates a risk of sudden flooding.
"From Baja California to North Sonora a total of 3 to 6 inches, it gets 10 inches, in some areas, and is likely to be run by Veter Dotim".
Then, before being on Tuesday as a tropical negotiator, the tropical storm will cross the border of Arizona and then move north through Arizona and move on Tuesday to The Ninta.
"The main danger that is expected to be in Rosa or its remaining power is that the rain occurs in Baja California and the Northwestern Sonora and US Dessert South Wales," said the National Hatic Center.
It is expected that this rain will be brought to life, in rapid floodings, in deserts, and in mountainous areas.

While he was in the state on the day of the execution of blood transfusions against students, the Mexican President Andrew Loreves Obrador was never using the military force against the common people.

The financial aid for artificial intelligence must be US doubles
Since China has become more active in the artificial intelligence, he has also worked in the company of investors and the EIC-Feccee-Fecle; he has worked in Google and Microsoft.
Even without the official AI policy U.S.A., the US government's various departments have followed the announcements of the EII.
China had presented a project last year, reaching its first goal on the 2030-year-old latest projects.
"As we consider the fact that all the nations of the world are behind the U.S., it would be a good start to double the AI research budget, we've planted what's the next advance in the AI", Lee said.
Once this week, the CNNBC said that the next largest AI achievement would be going to be in the UK.
"EI SuperPers: China, Cilcon Walley and The New World Order" has now been the CNN CNN's CNN CNN, published by Miflin Harcot, which has been the most important member of China's AI Company, and has been funded by the SII FI's contributions.
In 1980, he was created an AI system at the Carnigan Legion University, and the world's highest-in-law American Olympic player, then the executive of the Microsoft Reserve, and the president of the Google branch of China.
Lee praised the influence that the US government had made in the way of technology, such as the control Adances Adventures, and asked if there would be no one like that.
In the U.S., Lee said that researchers often require a lot of pressure on government contributions.
"Academak is not taking China to the people of Miami," Lee said.
Fesebook and Google and other technology companies were assigned to the colleges of great success to work with the AI in these years.
Lee also said that he was able to help with foreign policy in support of the UK's AI efforts.

This year the US Defense Department has established a Joyn's Architectional Intelligence Center, which has been announced that the project has been targeted to include participation in the industry and in the Academy of Academys, and the High House of Arts.
In this month, Dat has announced that I would invest $22 billion in the project AI Nexest.
In the case of NSF, it is rated over $1100 million per year in the AI research.

The Macedonians voted on the public test to convert the country's name
The Macedonian people voted Sundays in the trial of converting the country's name to "Ripbil of North Macedonia"; this move was blocked by the petition of the Macedonians for seeing a future solution to the ongoing controversy with Greece for decades; because this controversy was in the European Union or Nato.
Since there is a province within Greece, a claim is represented in their territory by Greece as the name of Macedonia, their northern neighboring country, and thus the petition of Macedonians to become a member of the European Union was blocked by their authority.
The two countries had reached a contract in June with the new name, but if the non-conventional anti-national anti-nation of the Macedonian population would be weakened by the division of Macedonia by the name.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the public test, because there were at least 50 percent to vote if the trial was valid for the public's trial, she expressed suspicion that the minimovies would not meet the demand.
This was recorded in the public examination by Bali: "Do you agree to a member of the Nato and the European Union according to the agreement with the Greens."
It is the price that the Prime Minister Zav, including the Representatives, argues that the sale to the bodies of the bodies such as the European Union and Nato, is a price to be renamed into Macedonia. One of the two countries raised from the fall of Yugoslavia is Macedonia.
"I've come today to vote for the future of the country for the young generation in Mississippi, so that they can live independently under the European Union, but that's the meaning of the European Union, that we all have a safer life," said Giejjar.
Although it is not legally present, the majority of the parliamentary members said that the result of public testing would be in accordance with it.
The name is needed for the parliamentary to have two majoritys.

However, in the 2016 parliament election, 66 percent of the votes registered were registered, 36 percent of the voted in a bell, and only 16 percent of the trial in the public.
"I've come to vote for my children, Europe is our place," said the capital of the Scottish JP, and Jos Twesky.
On 30 September 2018, the route to join Nato and the European Union in Macedonia was recorded by the Prime Minister of the Socian Sanza and his son Son, Soshu and his son's bad vote.
In front of the parliament in Spe J, the fifty-four-one-year-old Wladimur Khadarkov would be a small stage and pull the chairs out.
"We don't oppose to join Nato and the European Union, but we want to join the head, not through the back door," Kandrakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can make the aid of China or Russia and become part of Europe-Acia interface."
At the rate of unemployment, the prime minister Save says that more than 20% of the Macedonian investment required for more than 20 percent of the state's unemployment was to bring the NATO membership.
"I believe that a majority of the name change is in favour of the majority, because 80% of our citizens are in favor of European Union membership and NATO membership," Save stated after the vote.
He also said that the result of "so-called" would be "the confirmation of our future."
According to the Institute of Macedonia's Policy Research on Monday, according to the poll conducted on Monday, the vote between 30 percent and 43% of the population would be less than enough percent.

Shersenk wants to play Scerlers Rocks.

Trump went on to say, "You see the terrible, horrible monsters of the Democrats, and you see what's happening now.
They are determined to get back into the administration, using any means they need to use, that is, a little more than what you see.
They don't notice who has power and authority to get any harm, nor do they notice whom they kick, and what they need is power and control, and we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats are said to have been a mission for "a stop and stop".
Trump, "What you've seen in the past four days", "Dudia is a little, a little, a little, a bit of truth, and a lot of honesty," criticized Democrats.

No, no, I can wait, I'll wait for it - it's really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Lady Party is no longer an extensive church.
He won't tear it out with those who speak the truth.
I didn't feel surprised when the parliamentors in my local party voted to warn me.
Apart from all of this, I want to be the new person in the Lebert MPs line mentioned as no welcome.
The same experience also resulted from my parliamentary partner, Joan Riya, who was strongly involved in Antismissoryism.
In my case, the Tajikar criticized me for being Vygit with Jerem Corbie.
In similar topics, such as responsible economic policy, national security, and Europe, the former leaders have performed the Virgation with the former leaders.
The announcement for the Saturday note was stated to be "we want to be disintegrating and obligated to be."
As a local Labor MP, in every eight years of my life, the GGC meetings were exactly like that.
Sadly, not the nature of many meetings today, "no more gracious, more mild", has forgotten the promise of politics for ages; indeed, even if such a promise has ever been made.
More clearly, each opinion has been proven that it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It was just as soon as Jemmy became the leader, and my colleagues I used to think that mine was in the same political perspective, that I would walk in the opposite direction, and that I was expected to adopt the national security, security, and a single resource in the European Union, which I did not agree to.
When I preach to the public, without considering the subject, and not considering the subject, I don't think it's the honor of the society; some of my MP status, and say I'm going to leave the center political party.
This isn't just my experience.
I'm definitely more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the commanders coming to me are related to political issues.
I am proud of those who face sexual or racial abuse every day, but never be ashamed of their heads, and never humble themselves, and have a deep respect for the professionalism of my colleagues.
One of the most disappointing parts of this political era is that the skater's floors seem to be natural event.
The former week, Jeremi Corbien felt that a culture of tolerance was to be covered by the Lady Party.
In fact, we are no longer a universal church, and every "faith" theme comes, or when the electoral elections occur, the party is being disbanded.
I've been given a lot of advice for two years later, and I don't want to put my head down and not speak for as long as I am, and then I'll be "a thing of the way."
But not that I've come into politics.
When I was a school student 32 years ago, I was in the party, and my perfect school class was really falling down, and I was shocked by the band's presence in the way Tachchler's government actually showed me the way that a local council was being laid down, and I have also tried to bring the public service to those who need more.
I've never hidden my politics in any situation, including the past choice.
There can be no confusion in Notting Ham, no one in this area about my policy of awareness and the existing leadership of the current leader.
I just can't say to those who promote the theme on Friday, as I continue to advance the state of Brexing to our public services and our public services, I don't understand the ambition to waste time and energy related to my loyalty to the Lady Party leader.
But I really don't give a message to you, but rather to those who are not followers of the Lady Party on the horizon of my neutron: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you not to interfere with my status or the threat that I will put off, and I promise you that I will not interfere with your good interest in all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melterros: To Airra, unrepresented by Hitler.
Although the previous two balances may have been made to the final result somewhat, it is certain that Ayir had deserved success in today's exciting terminus Premiership competition.
The two teams are the most in the list in the ten-metechnium.
In short, the best resistance and their courage led the team ahead, and the professional Peter Murphy has all the right to rejoice.
"We've been tested in all competitions until now, and they still don't know defeat, so I'm happy and happy," he said.
Melro's Robin Cristi commented: "Mass Ayner was entitled to, and they were the first to test the chances."
Grant Anderson's ten-minute goal was achieved by Fresey Celmo, which led to the election, however, by the Winners, the Scott Lattt Capitier was given the yellow card that was given to the competition for the competition, at least a chance to Mercon's return, while Jason's efforts did not work.
As a result of a penal lead, a thousand were taken to the Bloomo lead, and after almost half the time before, the Klamo had taken a solo goal, so Iran was able to win 17-5 in the break.
However, in the second half, Melros began well, and when Patrick Anderson's efforts were carried out to the target, they were able to turn the difference into 5 points.
Due to a serious injury to Ayad, the long-time game ended, and the race resumed, and the Airlop was relocated, and Staford McDowell's attempt to reach the goal of the Stadford McDonwell.
Bruce Colwin was then given the temporary captain of the thousand and could not afford the chance of receiving the opportunity of receiving melovers at the hands of the heavy pressure.
Although the home Side has started running again, at the Penalty Line, after having received the Huchinzine yellow card for rejection of the sit-down, Maxson made a effort to move in the direction of the race.
The match was relocated to its goal, as it did when the match was relocated, and before that, David Adams took the box from Armstrong's and sent Gregor Henry, who had come to work on the field for the fifth effort of the Home Side.
Slate Game Star for the Chances in the restaurant industry.
The outer world was aware of this as a four-parted Kiaran in charge of a licensed restaurant company.
This fifty-year-old star is presented by Jack Jarcas in the popular BBC show, and in this show he writes himself, his long-time comic partner, Greg Hempf.
The Tarjot has announced that the ninth Series would be coming soon, and this will be the last season of the show, and it seems to be the busy key to planning life after the Craig Lamugh.
According to official records, he is the director of the Adrift Monmit.
Taran was not prepared to comment on the news, but the signal that Scottson's source gives the glass's "transition" is being focused on Kearnan.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia closed with land, is expected to open the way to the Pacific Ocean.
The shiprons run patrol at the Rugling-Clad Nepal in Lapas.
The government fans a sea blue flag in buildings.
The Nepal Bays have been decorated with the same seal word from Lake Titka to Amazon: "The sea is ours according to their rights.
It's a duty to recover."
Throughout the islands that were damaged by land, the memory of their sea shore is still in vain that they had to give some of their sea shore to some of the waters of the Pacific once and for all time is a desire to sail through the Pacific Ocean.
It is now within five decades of the hope which it has already come into full-time, because Bolivia has hoped for a verdict from the state court on the day of October, which had been taking counsel for the past five years.
"Bolivia now has a commission and a unity, and the country is expected with positive perspective," said a Bolivian debutist Robberta.
Many Bolivians and many of the large screens throughout the country will see the judgment of ICG as they hope to view the claims of the Tribloral Bolivia in a compassionate manner, after the controversy that will occur over decades in the sea, and think that there is some need to be concerned about allowing Bolivia to have a perfect way to the sea.
Bolivia's influential local president, Evo Morlets â he has to face the controversy of reorganization for the following year â and on Monday there is a lot of hope for the ruling.
"We are very close to taking the Pasophic back to the ocean," he swore last August.
Some who analyze say that the court will not be judged in favor of Bolivia, because no matter how much the court speaks in favor of the court, nothing will go to walk.
This UN body, based on Nelson Series, has no power to refer to a topic within some part of the Earth's atmosphere, and is determined that the outcome of events does not determine the outcome of events.
It is only six months after the final statements are heard that ICJ's fate is in the process of saying that the case was not "sublished," said some of the ICJ.
Instead of taking Bolivia's goal forward, the events of the past years may have been reduced to this goal.
"The current Bolivian constitution of the problem with access to the sea's current problem is high," said Zaku.
It may also have been left in the light of the good perspective that Chile might have had about Bolivia, and they may have commented.
Bolivia and some of the events will continue to take place at certain times, but it will be difficult to communicate after this.
Since 1962, both countries have not held each other's positions.
The idea that the decision of the court was unusually slow was rejected by the former President Edward Rodrigues Vesssze.
"A new era of relations with Chile will open," he said that Bolivia will receive a remarkable opportunity to end the "139 years of discussion" related to the benefits of the U.S.
The ocean problem is making his political profit - Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents who denied him.
"Never abandon Bolivia to receive access to the Pasophic Ocean" he added.
"This decision is an opportunity for the car to need what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea will not come to nuclear disarmament until U.S. can be trusted.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korean Foreign Affairs Young said that the country won't be put to the test by anyone who can trust Washington.
Saturday, Rick was talking in the United States General Azub.
He asked the United States that they should be prepared to carry out the promises held during the lunch season between the enemy states in Singapore.
His opinion was that the state Secretary of the state had begun to try to restart nuclear policy discussions three months after the end of the three months with North Korea's Kim Jong.
The U.S. protests and opposition to the declaration of the Republican War to end the Korean war, Rick said that the "pipe dream" is the only one that has ever been "a dream."
The US is refusing to admit to the announcement that the Pyeong Yang was not going to make a significant offensive move.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second minute.
Since it is possible to see the nation's safety as the only way to verify it, there is a widely-review of whether Pyong Yang has thought seriously about leaving a warhouse.
Pompio plans to visit Pyeong Yanging as part of the preparation for the Second Kim-Trump Airport.
Showed in the latest column Paris fashion of the big hat collection, which is immediately on the high street you're on.
If you want to add the size of the hat collection or cover the tail fully, you will no longer seek another.
The designers Vanlenino and Thom Brown released the column of the high-level hats that seemed to be insane for their SS19 collection in the Ravenway.
The hats, which seem to be totally unacceptable, have conquered in this summer, but these designers have brought their eyes back to Ram.
Walano's Master Pis was a piece of hat with large rice, like a swamped feather in the head of the models.
In the other high-insurgatives, the ornamentation of jewelry was involved with the monotonist hat and a piÃ±ata, but these hats are not designed to make your head warm.
A collection of strange faces, and a gun brown, many of which are easy to use.
The faces in attractive colors are shaped by the lips of many of them, and these masks were remembered by more than those of Hortics.
A complete skiing guitar with the snorkel and gogs made the other one think of the other as the ice cream angle.
If you're in great fashion, you're lucky.
Steel notes that these big-story hats are soon to be found in the stores and stores that are located near you.
These large-story hats come in, taking the method of 'La Bombay', which was the two-membered hat, and all wore the hat from Rahina to Emily Rajajusky.
Pillars behind non-final hats throughout the community media, Labal, due to another great creative creation, it was one of the largest skimbles of Steambore, which took place in Raum.
Paris fashion was created from the La Rireia SSS, the top white arm holding, and the Ryfia Kumorrows cut off the orange raffae.
The semi-employmentist Luch Armitic observed: "I hope to see the big hats and the beach bags in the next summer, because the design is a great impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need to be ignored for over-expressive guests."
John Edward: Language skills to global citizens are essential
The independent schools of Scott Laden have a track record of the Academy's finals, with another set of unusual trials, which was followed in 2018 with the performance, music, music, and other collaboration efforts, and a personal friend of the Academy of Academys.
These schools, which are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and more than 30,000 student students through Scotland, are trying to provide the best level of services to students and teachers.
The goal of the free schools is to prepare students for the high education they have chosen and their position as global citizens.
As a field of education, we see that modern languages will continue to be fond of people in the schools, as an educational field that is capable of creating and planning a unique school project.
Nelson said: "If you talk to someone in a certain language, he will climb over his head.
But as he speaks to him in his native language, he gets into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that when she wants to be with people from other countries and to gain their faith, she cannot rely only on English.
From recent testing results this year, we can see that languages are raised in the league lists with the highest success percentage of free types.
A total of 68% of students educated in foreign languages received a total of 6% of the Huer Grey A.
The data collected from 74 schools as members shows that 72% of the students received the Huir Air grade in Mandar and 72% of the students in the German students who studied with French and 63% of the Spanish students earned a total of 63%.
This shows that the free schools in Scotland support foreign languages in key skills that are vital to children and teachers in the future.
In the free school projects and other areas, like Steam (also science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), a choice topic is now being considered.
A survey of employment and skills found that 17% of the reasons that faced the challenge of appointing candidates in the fields were not in the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are more essential to preparing students for future employment opportunities.
Since languages are necessary in relation to future labor opportunities, these skills are not to be shared in globalized world.
Whatever the form of career you choose, if the candidates learn a second language, they will be truly focused on the future because they will have a long-time skill like that.
The ability to communicate directly from foreign countries, and the person who knows more than one language will naturally advance into competition.
In 2013, according to the results of the 'UGW' poll, more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% are unable to speak the language well enough to start a conversation, and 15% said that they have only one foreign language that they know.
That's why investments to language teaching are important to children today.
More than one languages are known, especially in developed countries, that the language has become so prevalent that children will be given more opportunity to find the meaning of employment.
In Scott Lund, each school teaches different languages.
When you focus on a more class language, other languages will be taught that the UK will be considered important when you lift your eyes to the front of 2020.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a lot of languages to select from the free schools within the foreign language field.
Although we do not know what the future is, the Scottish schools are a regulatory way of providing students with the skills needed to prepare children to succeed in life and to provide them with a study of weapons.
In a global business atmosphere, it is not a work that is now able to deny that languages will continue as essential to the future of the country, so it should be awarded in education.
Of course, modern languages must be considered as "intelligible communication skills"
Free schools will continue to provide this choice, variety, and mix for their children in Scotland.
II Foot Bin Le Ferre.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Free Schools.
On Sunday's Sunday Lakes Cricket will land on Lebron Games
The waiting for the fans who had been expecting the first time coming down on the Los Angeles Lakes.
It was announced that the Lakes' coach Luxon would play in the Pre-Sipson Opera on Sunday against Devent Naggtttts in Sandego.
However, James is not yet decided to play for a few minutes.
"The time will be less than a minute and less than 48 minutes", said Walton's official website.
The reporter's reporter Mike Trudel Twewt said James would play only for limited time.
Following the first training this week, James was asked about the Cic-Geam Pre-Syson schedule.
"I don't need Preservon Games at this point in Karry, for getting ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rail Time, Yutub Chanal.
Tonight at the Wayback of West Virginia, President Donald Trump's Rail's start.
This is the first of the five rallys that have been planned in the next week, including Tennisi and Mississippi.
With the resolution of his nomination in the Supreme Court, Trump puts the goal to increase the support of the people for the space that will take place in November, for there is a lot of concern that the Republican Party will lose control of Congress when votes in November.
What time is West Virginia Rail going on the night of Trump? How do you see it in the line?
Trump's rally in the West Virginia Wheels was prepared on 29 September 2018, Saturday evening at 7 o'clock (Intern Times).
Trump's West West Virginia Rail you can see in the YTU through the period stream.
The Supreme Court may refer to matters about this week's trial by the Supreme Court of Nominit County, with sexual misconduct that is above the council's high-fundation of the Council, and has extended the Senate's retirement until a week of confirmation that was to take place in connection with the FBI.
However, the primary goal of the conference is to bring a quick leap to the Republican Party, which confronts the election of November.
Therefore, Rodry reports that the president's goal is to advance the votes of five rallyers for the next week, saying that they are trying to keep up the majority of the Republican Party and to give energy to volunteers as well.
"Congress' control is so critical that we're warm enough to the president's establishment, and he's going to visit the state as far as possible," said a spokesman for Trump's programmes, but refused to reveal the name.
According to West Virginia Metros, Rali in the present night, which is organized in Vesban Corene, Vessel, will attract followers from "Ohio, Pensil and Vania, and win the attention of the Pittsburgh media".
The Trump had visited West Virginia for the past month, with a second visit on Saturday, and the Trump had won over 40 percent votes in the election of 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia Senate Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is behind a lot of claims.
"It's not a good indication that President has to come to the President to take good care of the morciarys," said the politician Simon Hayder, who said to Rochester.
Riceder Cup 2018: The team showed the strength to maintain expectations while entering Sunday's Simgle.
On Saturday afternoon after three-sided sessions, it may have been that the Resertor of this year was required right.
Although the media believe it is one of the true, particularly in matches such as this, the game's course of action is a whole-time technique.
If so, where do they say that they are now concerned?
"They were six points ahead and now four, so I guess it was with us as a little leap," Josh Speth said when the race's gone.
There are definitely four points ahead of four points in the match with twelve games.
However, as Speth says, the Americans think that the wind is at least favorable to them and that they are strong enough to have a strong spirit, and they are not encouraging them to overcome the game of the Spep and Justin Thomas, and they are proud to gain three points together.
'Freme TTto Greeny' is standing in front as an example to others.
After playing two games, Spap and Thomas were behind two points, the race was more loud when the audience performed a major "seatdown" to bring the match into four-sex.
His dog, who won the match at the fifteen, received the same celebration as he said to people that he didn't believe he was out of the American team game.
"You really have to do what you really want to do," said Spetch.
It's all that's left of each of the players now.
18 Hots to prove the line.
In the past two days, the only player to have more points than Spepe and Thomas is Frances Mollierri and Tommy Fletard's controversy with the Resider Cup.
The twins would not be in error with the gods, although the four earned the Europeans were separated from the Europeans, and the other four would not be able to make a mistake with the gods.
The only Joewood who didn't take a blog on Saturday afternoon, but they turned on Saturday morning and Friday morning, and the last nine Hobbles played by nine.
They are the ones who should be overcome on Sundays, and the way that their energy flows from the sound-right person to the person who seems to be moving around and their energy to one side, and there will be no one to establish a European victory over the Lake Gol Nationals.
It would be better for both of them to play different hots at a time.
However, there is little interest in what is being said about European greatness.
When he plays with Alex Norra as Jotson and Web Simpson, the hero of the morning's football team, Bibtson and Web Simpson dealt in intense difficulty.
In the first nine hoses, a Bog and a couple of dux were pushed into a hole with the Spanish and the Swedish.
But on Sunday, there's no one to save you from the pit.
The paraskes between Jots, the advice they offer each other, and the advice they give each other, are much more attractive to see the forks as well as the reason for any way they might be moved by a moment.
As a team, Europe goes on to be a good guide for the last day of the year, and it has shown that this Forms Series Series section, the team's team, and some of them have been particularly suspicious of their country, especially that their country has been a fight.
The last day of the Rover Cup with the lead in Europe 10-6.
On Saturday's Forts and Forms, the United States is raised with 10-6 lead, and goes to Europe as a healthy and healthy achievement for the last day of the rifle Cup.
The two wins over the Tulgarwoods that competed to play were led in the Le Golf National to take their last score four points, by Tommy Flettwood and Francisco Mollier.
After Thomas Jonathan's European, who was trying to recover the Trophys they lost two years ago in Hazeeltime, the series was established over the American flag in the morning, which was launched at 3-1.
Although the U.S. saw more than two matches with success, it cannot be reduced.
For Jim Furey's team to maintain the crown, the Sundays will need eight points from the 12 Simgills competitions.
The first four-pointed European-story, which will gain four consecutive points, is the second pair that was called the "molywood" after a dramatic weekend.
They then hit Woods and Patrick Reale in Fortballs, and then the American New Year's New Year's Birm Bress and Brebau, and the 5â2Â°4 of Uv.
On Saturday, Woods himself was dragged through two matches, even though the explosions between Mika's and now he has a total of 19 in the 29 matches at Fortballs and Fors.
The morning Forbes' rest was maintained by Justin Ross, along with Henry Steins and one of the world's three positions, Dustin Johnson and Brookska returned to defeat 2381.
However, the peaceful, windy day in the south of Paris couldn't make all of Europe their own.
Three times Major winners, Jordan Spap and Justin Thomas founded the scale with two points on Saturday as American.
In the Forballs, she won the victory of 2Â°1 over Joan Rahmin and Ian Polter, and later lost for the Formels Pompel and Ryric Melocroi, and returned to the start of 4â3 defeat.
Although Ferry has a measure of balance on the side of Ferry to maintain it as those in the Trophy hand, it is only returned from the lack of four points in the history of the rifle.
Despite having been in second place for two days, Sunday hope seems to be beyond them.
The answer is "There is no way" for the single-sided division.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister announced the United States's Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the ongoing siege had increased in the United States and under such circumstances there was no way to abandon nuclear weapons.
Last year, in North Korea, Rio Singh said that nuclear experiments and missile experiments were going to not spread nuclear test, nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, and the United States's annual community had begun to say that the United States's Common Assembly had begun to make significant measures in the public council of the United States.
"Even if, we don't see any similar reaction from the U.S.," he said.
"We don't believe in our national security without any conviction in the UK, and in such cases we have no way to put ourselves out as one-sided".
Although the North Korean complaints about the resistance of the "institution" approach to nuclear reform, as well as that of the anti-surgance of the anti-Sington, such as before, were rejected by the exception of Pong Yang; his statement was important because he did not reject the one-sided nuclear weapons; because due to his lack of weapons, the answer has to receive the responsibility of the Republic of Korea.
At the peak of June 12, Kim Jong and Donald Trump were released in the joint statement that Kim Young and Donald Trump would act for nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and that Kim was promised to ensure that the North Korea security would be maintained; and a active US president and his former president, the president of the United States, was the first to arrive at the airport.
Although North Korea is originally attempting to end the Korean war officially in 1950-553, it is the position of the United States to give up the Pyong Yang nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the awards for reducing the heavy international sieges that have been in place against North Korea.
"US's First Nuclear Division" "Computing and increasing pressure rates by the sieges to build up their goal as strong as they are, even protesting 'the declaration of war', Rick said.
"It is a pipe dream of those who are unaware of us who think we're being overwhelmed with supplies.
The problem is that the ongoing siege causes our lack of faith."
Route did not refer to the plans for the second-year-old project between Kim and Trump, and the US leader of the United States first said about this.
Instead, in the last five months, the minister quoted three interviews between Kitin and the South Korean leader Moon Jail, added: "The client in this issue was in the south of Korea, not in the US, that the nuclear strike on the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a collapse."
Even so, the sound of the current speech was so dramatic that the song of the song that was announced in the United States last year was so dramatic that it was said that the United States has called the "Roukat man" Kukat, and that the U.S. government has called the U.S. President A suicide attempt, and therefore said that it is necessary for the Korean Rocks to be targeted by the US Metland.
In the last year, Trump was threatened to destroy North Korea completely, and this year, in the United Nations Council, he covered Kim with praise of the courage to take action in the process of decommissionion, but said that he needed to take further action and remain under siege until the end of the North Korea nuclear strike.
Wednesday, Trump, who said there was no time for this, added, "There's nothing wrong if I take two years or three months or five."
The China and Russia argue to pay the UN Security Council for the actions they took so far.
On Thursday, however, the US state Secretary of State of Security for the UN Security Council said that the US State Secretary Mike Pompio should continue to implement the banal measures that have been ordered by the Council until the final and final nuclear weapons must be established."
The security Council has raised enough concerns against North Korea since 2006 to prevent money for the Pyeong Yang's nuclear, basstic missile projects.
It was found in the subway of the UN General Assembly and later said that Pyong Yang would visit again next month to prepare for the second season.
Pompio has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not improve.
Although he left Pyong Yang, he said that he was "like the needs of the group" within the last traps.
The North Korea meeting was confirmed that if America had taken "like measures", a missile site and a nuclear mass would be destroyed.
Kim told him that the security forces, which had been guaranteed in Singapore, were also directed to the common level of relationships with Washington.
Harvard Students study course to get enough sleep
This year, Hardard brought a new course of sleep for all students in the University of Harvard, and the Cuff was presented as a new course in the fight against the 'Mumu' culture of sleeping all night.
Academians often found that students in the first place were not at all clear on the basics about how to care for themselves.
The course is designed by Charles Caesarl, a specialist at the Bridged Medical School of Harvard Medical School and by Brig Ham and Wimens Hospital, who believes this is the first course in the U.S. history.
He was inspired to begin the course after a lecture about how sleep is affecting learning.
'When the speech ended', a girl came to me and said: 'When I'm in the last year, what's the point of saying this to me?
She said no one told him about the importance of sleep - this surprises me, '" he told Telegraph.
This course, which was first presented this year's first time, explains to students the basics of what it takes to help the Academy of Sleeping, how it helps to improve their general welfare.
During the week, the University of Harvard Medical School of Education and University Health Services said that the students chose to perform the course after finding out that students are in serious sleep.
In the course of an hour long, an interview has been included.
In a category there is a picture of Dor's room, where students click in coffee cups, workshops, books, and books, they can hear of the lack of sleep due to the lack of sleep and the effects of sleep.
In another category, students are told how long the risk of heart attack, heart disease, depression, cancer and cancer increased.
Then, a map of the Camps, with interdependent icon, encourages students to think about their social events.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
However, as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking cigarettes, we believe that they have the right to know, and that the 'scidence' added.
He also said that a proud culture is still present and that the pressure of modern technology and academics has increased on the students is a problem that is increasing in the process of getting too much sleep.
A student's â secret weapon' to resist stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, while we are asleep, we tend to starve the brain, and cause it to be constant.
A 19-year-old man and physical Biological Biology studied, Raymond So, professor of California, helped design the course of Sysla, and Raymond was in his first year of class in Harwa.
He also said that the course had opened his eyes and that the camp had been moved to do the whole course.
He is expected to ask all graduate students to complete the similar study project before joining the competition based.
Professor Cesarler recommended that you have to watch the time and time to wake up and give the alarm the alarm, and that you know about the bad effect of the film's "elections of the Blue Line" that bring out the electronic screens and the LIDlights.
Lyvetington 1 â 0 Rainers: Meng's Gol Jair's players defeated.
When Doy Meng's beat-up team was transferred to Liverpool's defeat of 1-0, it was difficult for the Rainers to get away another time from their regular left.
Since the 4â1 victory that was won in Seyton in February, the 4â1 win was looking for their first championship, but Gary Holt's team defeated only the second one between the 18 games as the manager's manager.
Seven minutes before the break, Memga Gol beat, but the inspiration-in-law Reichs rate didn't seem to back up.
When the Rangers were down to the sixth place now, Liverpool climbed to the third side of the race, and was replaced by Herburn in the Gol difference.
One object that seems to have been thrown out of the rear will have to be in charge of the Cricket Lineman Arts Art and Spaces will be more difficult to the Rangers.
Jeffard made eight changes in the team crossing the Burny Betford Cup Seychelles.
Holt, on the other hand, was sent down to the same Livi 11 who had been trained for a point from Hartt last week, and the group who had been trained would have made him very happy at every stage.
Although the Rangers may have ruled in office, Livetington managed the ball they got.
In the second minute of the game, Meorg's first Leof Pass Spot was sent to the league of the Mexicans, but the middle-sided player missed his great chance.
Despite having reached Captain Craig Hill, a leading Freeman of Cape Jacobs, his debut companion Alan Ligawu was only a shot in the back of the post.
Although the Rangers have taken control, their progress seems to be more expected than their belief in the game.
While he was in the 15th minute of the season with Christopher Morlows, it seemed to him that Steven Lawlets had obtained a pental, but Referee Steven Thomson rejected the candidate's appeal.
In the first half of the season, Regens' goal was seen only two shots, but a headhead of Lazzana Colibia and Ovi ejaria's undicated slave, and the former Gobalm of the Ibrics didn't have to take a short time.
No one can deny if they just get caught in the trap if they just catch up on the game, at least 34 minutes of Livi's time.
Representatives failed again in dealing with an extremely influential setups of Jacobs.
When Deklan Galler was delivered to Scott Robinson Bowl, Scott Arfield didn't react, and Robinson chose Megan to remain calm.
Jeffard responded by putting Ryan Kent in the break, and the change made a sudden change, although he was playing with Morlow, and his heart, Harry Kelly, rushed from his line to stop it.
However, Lyvetington was still in the same game that would appeal to visitors exactly, and Lithage and Halkt were struck by a series of long shots one by another.
In the final stages, Holt was able to pull their lead to their side, but the Mexicans were denied opportunities by Jacobs and Lithgas.
When Glenn Midtton was mixed with Jacobs, he argued for Penny another short time, but Thompson denied it again.
Lomingham: Guigar Counter's producer
Now our "Sson Day Morning" page from the Panthunge: September 30, 1882, and today's future physicist Johannes Wilhelm's "Hins" born in GÃ¼hgar JÃ¼rish.
The Guigar developed a method to detect and measure the radio accident, which ultimately led to the device called Gaigar County.
Since then, the GÃ¼igar County changed to the main level of pop-ups, and in the 1950s, it is seen in the film "Cowboy's Sciences and Dave Evans's Act" film:
Man: "What the fuck is this?"
Rogers: "It's a gigger council that is used to detect radio atoms, such as genianum.
When you perform these Iarphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms that create a radio-tribution in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, I'm sure it's cracking now!"
"Haz" Gilger died in a few days after his 63th birthday, in 1945.
But this invention, carrying his name, remains to this day.

Professor Jane Bergen, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute of Maryland, said: "The results we have received indicate that we have a very optimistic vaccine."
Professor H. Brofsky explained that the growth of multiple types of cancers, such as breast cancer, heart cancer, lung cancer, lung cancer, and cancer.
A similar approach from patients has been successful in treating blood cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cells.

The presidential group, TPS, was supported by WWS's Head, Kandes Twitter, and Twitter: "One of the most bold souls: Thank you for being separated from the group."
However, it was the West that did "the same way, that he was truly amazing" by the company of the Tok Show.
"But I don't decide to give a man the reward (for obtaining his music or buying his clothes or supporting his "destructure") that is harmful to my society.
He's a free man.
We're just like that," they added.
Prior to the show, Rapper was informed in Twitter that his name was changed, "He was known as the Canaian West".

The game of Thronus Tart Mt Harington attacks a man-producted man.
Kit Harington was the son of President John Snow of Thron, the violent medieval fans of HB O's violent Middle-time Fantasia.
However, a 30-year-old star, Tara, who saw such costumes on the screen, believed that young boys were going to believe that the rough character needed to be respected, and he was attacked by Machi hero's statistical.
In the interview with The Sunday Times, Kitt, who said he believed he believed that it was wrong, asked how he could solve the problem of the toxicity of men at the time of #Metut.
Kit, who recently married Rose Lesley (31) of the Game of Thron, admitted that he must believe that he must address the problem.
'I am now personally, very strong - where is it wrong for us to be involved with men'?' he asked.
What do we teach boys who grow up with the problem we see now?"
Since there are a number of male characters in TV programs, Kitt believes that the growth of toxic humanity is partly due to television.
He went on to say: "What is "humanly," and what is taught?
What do young boys think they should have to teach in TV and on the streets?
I think this is one of the great questions in our time - how do we change this situation?
Because there's something wrong with young people."
When the next series ends in the summer, he admitted that he didn't perform the game of Thron's prespectives or seals, and that 'wars and horses had been fed up'.
Since November, Sam Shepper's team will play Kitt in the reprinting of West, and this is a story about the film producer and fake brother.
The best thing that came out of the game of Thron was recently revealed that he had met his wife Roses.
"I met my wife in this show, so the show gave me the life of the future family to move on to now," he said.
Rose was presented as a lover of John Snow's character in this Ember Award series.
Both were married in June 2018 in Lesley's family estate.
HIV/Eids: 14% of new cases are increasing China report
China announced that the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS had increased by 14 percent.
Health officials say that this disease affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only on the second foot of 2018.
It marks a change from the past, which most of the new cases are transmitted through sexual relations.
In some parts of China, HIV was rapidly spread in some parts of the world, using blood from individuals who had been infected.
However, in a conference in the Chinese health authorities, the Chinese health officials said that the number of H I vu was almost extinct in this way.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS victims in China has increased to one million per year.
HIV transmitted through sexual contact between L GBT communities in China is a serious problem.
China was not convicted of homosexual cricket in 1997, yet the LGBT has remained in a harsh manner with people.
The studies estimate that 70-90% of men and women who engage in sexual relations with men will eventually marry themselves.
The disease is often caused by the lack of sufficient sexual protection when men are involved in sexual relations with each other.
As a part of the effort to solve the problem, the Chinese government has promised to supply HIV drugs globally since 2003.
Their staff, the GP senator's data was not leaked, and such allegations were accused of 'guide lies' and the 'guide theory' by McConnators.
The US representative Maxine Watard denied the charges that the Republican U.S. Senators' personal information had been filed on Wikippedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrat emphasized that only the only claims that "Tavra's right" are moneyed and web sites.
"Wounds, Lies, and more humiliating lies," said Warren in the Twitt statement.
Outdoor information reports that the home addresses and phone numbers are included in the US Senators South Carolina, Mike Lee, and Orner Hatch.

Three senators questioned Kawar, and in a few minutes the information was released on the line.
Hael reported that the IP address office is connected to the source of the posters, such as the Gate Winner and the Red Area and released information from a member of the Waller Staff.
"This unsatisficial charge is totally false, totally false," Wallers continued.
Because of the false and incorrect allegations, my life has been dismissed in the Identiary, personal information, and security, but I am not responsible for any kind of life's loss of information.
This fundamental charge is totally false, totally false.
In Waters' statement online, the former White House called criticism from the former Secretary of State Awards, including Flair.
"There's a anger in this denial," wrote Flesher.
"This indicates they don't feel like being a Congress member.
When someone accuses you of something you don't do, you don't want to be angry.
It's not necessary to be arrogant.
Do not question the motives of the offender.
Showing calm and self-defence."
Flair was trying to compare the response to the criticism of the Democrats regarding the judge, and critics accused him of being angry during the trial on Thursday.
The Republican position that competed to expel Walters in the election expressed his opinion in the Twitter.

Watters stated that the office of the appropriate authorities and lawkeepers of these false claims had been announced.
"We will make sure that criminals will be brought to light, and we will ensure that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which make anyone alive a disaster or accident in any of their lives," they continued.
Johnny S. S. S. S.A.'s English strike review - With Ron Atkinson's Power, Spi Spof.
It is now a way of looking for new things in any new film by British chassis, and this 'Joney' English-Commery' is now a part of the Act-Correy Suffi's second part of the film - "Geilian English", which started in the 2003-2006 film "The English-American movie" "News".
Would this self-defence in relation to the subject about which we are clear and so undestructed as the new export of the country?
No matter what it means, the eye is blind, the faceless, the English has a second time to make things fat - and the English language is a lot more common than that he is designed for the film-making fields.
Of course, he is a physicratic agent, even though he has been a piece of dust in the performances of Mr. Beans's appearances and a piece of dust at the opening of the 2012 Olympics at the Waybacks of London, as well as a young man's debuter's debuter's debut to the film's theme.
He is actually based on the man who once acted as an actress and trusted in the evil, who is the one who no longer remembered by no one.
This new Johnny English release has one or two fine heads.
I liked Johnny English who approached the helicopter for the helicopter for a while, wearing the shield of the Middle Ages.
Atkinson's ability to show physically fun is seen in this film, but its results have no strength, especially in the strange types of types, especially in the "high" film, such as 007, and Minneticism, are now present as a mixed-families.
I feel that the film's humor has been designed for children more than adults, and I have never felt that the silent film that Mr. Beinson played as a character was more straightforward than the latest film, or in English adventures.
Great Britain is in serious trouble, and the film is still the permanent subject environment.
It is sad that Kevin Elden, who plays as an agent, is only a small rock rocker, who is a member of the Amber Hacker's super-subjector website, and reveals the identity of all British agents working in the Secret Intelligence area.
It is the last layer of the Prime Minister, who has already become politically divided and full of hate and hate for all, even though Emma Thompson is showing the best performance to present this character, such as Theresa Mea, is nothing more true in script to do.
Because of the personal reports of all active spies in the Secret Place, the prime minister's confidential counsel is telling them that he must bring someone who is retired.
The person who will, in English, is an English, with no organised form, and the client is a schoolmaster who works in some rich institution, but the client teaches about how to perform the 'Of-de-dequate' work: there's good time here, and there's a little time in the school's college, and it's best to teach the English Academy of Arts.
The English return to the White Hall for emergency buffling and re-united with his long-term associate Boe, who played Ben Miller again.
Bug is currently married, a sub-resident Marine commander, and his wife has destroyed Wikiki Pepeard in the character of the 'Jely-Hooky-Tinik'.
In the Secret Service of the 'Heer Megisy', Batmann and Robin came back, but what comes to be called 'The Work' started, and the things that are being confronted with the beauty that is presented by Olga Cullierco.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into risk for the influence of the British's computer problems that he claims to be able to solve: Jay lassey is the one who is presenting the perpetuation of the percussionist Jason Votal.
English and Buffalo begins the show of artificial copies: They make a French restaurant in the costume of the waiters; they make them go to the street of Woltter's luxury, and they scream at them in the street of the street to get them into the rest of the house; while John makes a full effort to take in touch with Wol's house.
They have taken all the skills out of the film's back and all of it out, but since it is very mild and fun, it looks like the short-view TV.
An average film.
When I saw other Johnny English films, I still couldn't think of it: Can't the British movie industry be able to give a character to Ron Atkinson's genius?
The British denied the news that they would work for four days a week but then plan a plan to buy five days' pay.
The team is preparing to consider a progressive project that allows the British to work four days a week, but the party of Jeffrey Corber is going to consider an ongoing project that allows the British to earn five days of work during the week.
Reports say the party wants the company to deliver employees for a long day's wages by providing a long day's wages.
If this happens, the staff will enjoy three days' weekends - but the old one can be bought.
News sources say that the idea is compatible with the financial agenda of the party and that the party plans to appeal to the country in favor of employees.
Trades Union Congress recognizes the idea of working four days a week, as a way to obtain the benefit of the changing economy.
A senior leader of the Lebert Party said to the Sunday Times: "I am expected to review policy before the end of the year.
âIt won't happen by one night, but it's a suitable desire for the party's approach to fit the economy in favour of employees and to the total business policy of the party.'
It is not the first party to accept the four operations of the day, Labert Party, who had promised the Green Party four working days during the public campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition, in turn, is not recognized in the whole of the Labor Party.
A Lady Party spokesman stated: "The concept of work is not that the party doesn't consider it to be a party policy."
Shado Chantor John McDordon was used to explain his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take power from the 'incorporater' in the UTTI firms.
The plans for Shado Chances do not bring back their full share of the current stockers in the whites, because a Labor government may be able to find out the wrong way in the way of the wrong works.
He confirmed that there were plans to create and create the Inquisibility funds to provide 10 percent of employees in the companies, and 10 percent of private institutions to provide a share.
The FI investigation on Kawaru can change their mind "60 minutes" Linda Simmer and John Kennedy.
The FBI investigation related to the charges against Judge Bret County and the final vote for him to command the Supreme Court of Justice was delayed for at least a week, and the question has been raised whether any Republican senators would persuade them to withdraw the support of the Supreme Court.
On Sunday's interview with the "60 minutes of the Ci" Scott Perry asked John Kennedy and Linssen to move them to change their decision to find anything that could be found by the FBI.
Kennedy was more open to the mind than to a colleague from South Carolina.
"My answer is, 'It's true'," said Kennedy.
"I said I'm going to trial, and I said I talked with Judge Kanoga.
After this happened, after the charge came out, I called and asked him, 'Do you do this?'
He showed determination, determination, and auditation."
However, the planet's vote, as if fixed in stone.
"I've formed my mind about the Bret County, it's just a allegations shot," he said.
"Do. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Bret denied it with Wheeling," he added the planet.
"No one whose name they have mentioned has confirmed this.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't see any new change. "
What is the Globe Cityon Festling, and has something been done to reduce poverty?
The Globe City Festival will carry New York hostship on Saturday, and the annual music program will have a significant mission to do so; and the world's poverty will be suspended.

The group estimates that the money they have collected has directly influenced 649 million people around the world.
After receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Globe Citys, the main promise is that they can be offered $135 million in order to end the poverty of Rwanda. One of the main concerns is that they will be given $135 million in order to help the country end of the country's economy.
"With the support of the United States government and national governments and the support of the National Governments, we can fully settle the social injustice of the poor poverty in the history of poverty", in April 2018.
After taking over more than one hundred steps to improve the growth of mothers and children, the government announced that it would provide financial assistance to the project of the Power of Newwealth, which would reach 5 million women and children and provide them with nutrition.
The question, "Why do you think you can end the poverty that lies within its web site?"
Globe Cityson replied: "It's gonna be a hard and hard way - maybe we'll fall and fall.
However, like the great civilist movement and the anti-cultural movement that is ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful when we are together.

For this reason, the US President Donald Trump government is trying to persuade Nord to withdraw from the North River 2 pipe line plan, according to Truman, the project has been made to become the "Birn" of the German Berlin.
The existing pipeline capacity, which is prepared to double the 110 billion dollars to double the sum of a billion dollars, was repeatedly stressed by Moscow that it was a very economic project.

US Ambassadors blame that China is threatening with 'productal advertising'

Terry Branddd, owner of the largest institutions in which the US Ambassador of China and the man who has been serving as governor of Iyoi, said that he has been affected by the loss of American farmers and farmers and businesses.
"Presidents in our own free media are currently being threatened by China," wrote Brade Tyd in the Sunday Times of the Daily Mosst's Register.
"The Chinese government is taking advantage of the concept of freedom and media freedom in America by giving money to DÃ©s Moe Nessner, to broadcast the Propagara in the United States," wrote Brandard.
In contrast to this, he wrote: "You can't see the news sound of the Widing Streets, and can't see the actual perspective of the opinions of the Chinese people about the economic route of China, because the Chinese Communist Party has written the media under the majority of the Communist Party."
He also wrote that his article "From the promise that it will make, one of China's leading newspapers broke off", but he did not mention which paper is.
If Kahuau continues to be disbanded, researchers will find that before the election, the female vortor would frame the Republican Mar.
Since many former Republican party leaders are also involved with the Supreme Court of Human Rights, and the Supreme Court of Human Rights, who is in charge of the decision to come, the Republican Party has been warned that the Republican Party will face a counter-constitution from women.
The feelings surrounding it are so high that most Republicans already want to go forward as a vote.
These things won't go back," in an article published on Saturday, The Hill, written by Max Welding Science at the University of Series, written by Grant Reader.
The final moment of the season, Senator Jeff Floyd (R-Amazon), said he would have to suspect that he would not be able to calm the angry votes.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday â they will not be forgotten tomorrow and in Nabumbo," the development group's adult advice and the national women's role is reported by the Washington DC newspaper.
Despite the fact that Dr. Christin Blasey's truth was due to the fact that the Republicans were planning to move forward with the name of the Canoga, on Friday morning, the protesters at the pass of the Senate are called "Straw" and reported by Mike.
"Democratic party's enthusiasm and motivation are going to be excluded from chart," said St. Roenberg news site, who has been no racial analysis.
"People say it's already high; that's right.
However, there is a further way to add, especially among women in the streets and in the areas, and young women who are 18 to 29 years old, although they do not like the president's vote."
The investigators felt that prior to the introduction of Fore's advertisement of the public statement against the Supreme Court nomination, the Republicans thought the Republic would have to be defeated if the Republican was going forward with confirmation.
The NC News reports that the Republican National Council said it was first mentioned by former Chairman Michael Stewart last week.
"It is not only about the vote of the council's vote or the final vote, but also about the way the Republicans have handled this charge, and how the Republicans have treated the victim," said the press's group for helping the Democrats choose the Democrats."
However, the Americans seem to have felt that they should not believe who should believe in the background of Fore and Kahuhu's and the background of the originals, because they are putting a bit on Cauauau to trust him.
A new poll conducted by Yugave shows that 41% of people believe that Forwa's truth is the root or event, and 35 percent said that the event or the council is certain.
In addition, 38% of the people said that Canogue is sure of or event lies in his truth, and only 30 percent said aboutford.
Following the request from Flair, The Guardian reported that the FBI has been looking for allegations of at least one-membered Debora Ramer.
At the age of seventeen, Kawanau himself was attacked by the alcoholtry and was offered by the Senate Senate Committee in the past week.
Ramese claims that while participating in a party in the 1980s, the Supreme Court Nominini showed his birth-in-law.
World Wid Vebe's producer to start a new internet to compete with Google and Feebook.
A start-up that attempts to compete with Fei Series, Amazon and Gigill is about to begin to find the WorldW website, Tim Berners-Le.
The project has been created by the company named initpt, the latest project of this technology, by Bernard-Le's own Opne Sore-Plat-Plat-Pret-Prett.
Users are allowed to choose where the data can be stored and to allow access to which people can be admitted.
In a special interview that allowed the fast company, Berners-lealy said that the purpose behind the Independent was "world sovereignty".
"We need to do it now," he said about Starpa.
"It's a historic moment."
The app is used by the technology of the production to allow people to be their own "personal online data store" or to allow a POD de creation.
It will include contact lists, lists of items to do, calendars, music library, other personal and professional tools.
This is the technology that the Google Drive and Microsoft Outdoor Outdoors and Slamporates can be performed at the same time at the same time at the same time in the same bureau.
What type of information is determined by what kind of people can perform, is that the use of the individual data store is entirely used.
It is referred to by the company as "a personal definition through the Duta".
CIO John Bruce says that the company of the company is to be a company to provide resources and propsessive skills to help all take the building.
The company is composed of Bernard-Les and Brooks a protected platform that was purchased by the IBM, and some of the online-staf Democrats and volunteers are a commission of co-operation.
From this week onward, the technology Democrats around the world can create their own self-destructures using equipment available on the Internet.
Bernard Lee said that he and his team would not talk to Facebook and Google about whether their business models should be fully shown in one night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
On a television post published on Saturday media, Bernard wrote that it was "to provide commercial energy and a habitat mission to protect the new verbrey's efficiency and quality.
In 1994, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology established the World Wired Web Sites on Technology, and the Berliners introduced the Internet.
During this recent months, Bernards-Le was influenced in the controversial debate.
Despite the beginning of the Invert, Bernard Lee will continue with the founder and founder of the WorldW Web Center, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am a non-intelligible believer in this recent era of Web's," added Berners-Lie.
Bernard Van: The priest who earned Victoria Toria Cross for participating in the First World War is reminded of
The only discussion that Victoria Crose received for participating in the First World War was performed by locals after the last 100 years of his life.
It was won September 29, 1918 for the invasion of Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Bernard van Bellings and Lehort.
However, four days later, he had never known that a sniper had killed him and that he had gained the highest British military honour.
His two grandchildren hosted the memorial stone at the Saturdays in Rachdesh, Norway.
Michael Van, one of his grandchildren, said that the stone was "a sharp symbol" during the exact 100 years after his grandfather's work had been received.
According to London Gazette, which was published on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van, the Canal de-center, led his battalion from "Contain to ice and electricity and to the field."
Then he rose to the fireline and spread the "great glory" and ran alone to a field-guon line and led his battalion to lead three of the enemy soldiers.
A month before the end of the war, on 4 October 1918, Lieutenant Colonel van was killed by a German sniper.
"I know that I have not lived according to the example of my grandfather, but that makes me humble," said 70-year-old Mike van.
He and his brother, Dr. James Van and the Flower, presented the band after running in the command of Bretwood Yutan.
Michael Van said that he has been very proud of his role in the parade, "a true hero has been proved by the support of the people," he added.
Bellor spent the whole night sleeping to see 206, MM fans had to be satisfied with Peppg.
Imagine what it would be like if you were sleeping all night watching the crowd rowing Betor 206 and how you'd be denying this important event.
The bill from San Jos is 13 matches including six matches in the main card, which show the channel's 5th of the UK.
At 6:00 a.m., Gagard Mossa and Roy McDondonon were shocked by the audience of the UK when the Cup was moved to Pupag.
Those who waited until morning to enjoy the fight were utterly disappointed.
One of Twitter's fans was moved to the cartoon of the Skinews and said that it was "a kind of stupid joke" because it was the first time that the film was released.
"Because the officers are in control, they had to move to the children's program at 6:00 a.m.," said Dave Chatz, senior president of the Bellatre Market and Communications.
"Spepa The Plog," yes."
Beller Company said the future will try to create the type of schedule that will include audiences in the UK.
"When we think about the Repell, I think we can solve this problem," Cocker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the Sunday morning, we can't solve this until Sunday's time and their time.
But we're trying to solve this.
Believe me, when the cabinet changed, there were a lot of text messages and a lot of text messages, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to solve this, and we initially thought it was a technical crash.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We have six battles â as we do normally - it seems that we gave the audience more than we wanted.
This is a unfortunate situation."
Dessert Ilande Cup: Tom Daly felt that he felt "a sense of self-proportionation" with sex.
The Olympic activist Tom Daly says that he has grown to feel inferior to others because of his sex, but this gave Daly the motivation to win Daly.
The twenty-four-year-old said he didn't realize that everyone was like me until he went to the Senate School.
He spoke of the first radio broadcasting by Lauren Laverton 4 Dessand Illand Cup, and spoke of the homosexual rights that others offer.
He also said that a Lord would take some interest in winning the Olympics.
For a long period of time, the chief of the show's constant tyresti Yong disease was a number of months off because of the disease.
Dale was just as trapped in the first program by Lavon, and Daly said that he felt as if the community did not approve of the community of men and girls alike."
He said: "The feeling of being inferior to others and feeling different and the strength to win has been the real things that have been given me to this day."
He concluded that he wanted to prove himself to be "what" and that he was finally not disappointed when everyone finally learned about his sexual relations.
Dale, who has achieved two times at the Olympics, has now become a large LBT popular, and has been used by his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to rule the division.
He said that he had opened his mouth because he felt good to live in public without adverse consequences, and because he wanted to give others "a hope."
With a man, the US filmmaker, whom he met in 2013, said three times the World Champion Daly, "I was surprised by what he was falling in love."
He also said that Oska, aged 20, married Daly, who was more than 20 years old, but was never a problem at the time.
"When you were too young to be so young as a child" â At the age of 14, he said it was difficult to meet a man who had suffered cancer after three years of death and whom Daly's father had suffered a similar death - and who had suffered a similar stroke.
In June, the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Black-daley, who said that he had changed his "New World View" by saying that he had changed his "to the full perspective."
"If you've asked me the last year, I'll be talking about a gold medal", he said.
"You know, there are great things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robin".
After the discovery of the brain cancer cancer, in 2011, at the age of forty, Daly's son is named in the same name as his father, Robert.
The last time he asked that he would never admit that he was going to die, he said that London's tickets were still there, because Daly said he wanted to see him in the future.
"But I couldn't say that Dad would be there until the time he's sitting on the front line," he said.
"I took hold of his hand until he took the last breath, the breath actually stopped and he died," he said.
The following year Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the Vekamal.
"I've dreamed this whole life I've dreamed about it - to sink a motherland in front of the crowd in a Olympic Games, he said, "There was no better feeling than this," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Heath Series's pre-selected and selected, and the song echoed in him to the Olympics, and he still has the hair still hearing this song.
Dessert Iland Day is on Sunday 11:15 BST p.4.
The Rainer Cup's Saturday didn't drop Mikelsen, who was not a better form on the Saturday.
On Sunday, Philelson will play his 47th-yard rifle competition, but he will have to try to keep his form on the body from being a sick-time stone.
In this two-year-old episode in Evan, where he played the 12th-year-old-time-to-day football game at the end of the season, the captain Jim Frick was released on Saturdays and Fors.
Instead of playing the game as often as it is for the Americas, he was the winner five times, and had spent the day training in the hope of solving the problems that affected him.
The 48-year-old man was not the right man to the hard-grand national courses, even in the face of his game, and would punish the field with a wrong shots.
Although this golf course is no longer so difficult, it is clear that it is the most difficult to meet the ninth match on Sunday's final match to the British Opton Champion Frances Moranaly, who has been involved with the newly formed composer, Tommy Fleeda, and their four champions have been involved in the success of the new week.
If the Americans under four points are given a strong start in playing 12 Simgills competitions, the game of the Micelson would become critical.
He expressed confidence in his player, not saying he can't say anything else.
"He has fully realized what he must do today, and he said to me that he would be ready tomorrow if he was to hang out on my back."
He's got a lot of confidence in you.
He's been away for a while and has contributed very much to these teams in this week.
I didn't imagine he would play two matches.
I've imagined more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought.
He wants to be in the game, like the rest of the others.
The record of Nick Fuldo played the top rifle on Sunday.
A well-known racer's end with the tops of his personal record will be noted at the end of the Cup Cup.
Mikelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven balances, however, Fairy said that he brought many of his presence to the team that he couldn't know.
"He's a rhysitic, ridiculous, funny man who loves people to be teased, he's also a great man who wants to be on the team," explains Furick.
I think it was a fun meeting him this week for young guys, and it was fun to see it.
He will provide more than just a game.
Europe Captain Thomas John knew that the big lead would disappear soon.
The European captain Thomas Johnny is well aware of the experience that the last day of the day in the rifle's Cup would soon be the worst lead ever to the symmetrical.
As of the Olympics held in Waldema in 1997, although the team had gained five points more than the captain of the Sev BalÃ©stossey, the Finsing Line has reached them at very little difference, and won the 141â2â131rd lead.
"You're reminding yourself that there's a great lead in Valdarma: Brook had a great lead in the line, where we were defeated, and we were defeated, and that was just a victory in Waldar's, for which John said, "The team of John was won in the Golfield Sunday 53-106 in the lead yesterday and the 2018.
So history and others in the team have also shown that this is not going to end.
You'll be all boring tomorrow.
Turn away from that kind of position, and do all the right things.
Nothing ends until you get the points on the board.
We've got a goal, that's what we're trying to get this trophie, and that's what we're all focused on.
I always say I focus on the 12 players in my team, but we know who else is on the other side - and they're the best players in the world."
In the performance of his team at the rough golf course, the happy John added: "I can't ever go ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is but a different animal.
Tomorrow is the forward personal performance, a different thing to do.
It's very happy to be in the course with a partner when things are done, but if you're alone in the course, you'll be completely tested as a golf player.
That's the message you have to give among the players, that's what's the best of you tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving the partner, and he wants to go get the best from him."
Unlike Johnny's, the opposite attitudes are directed by Jim Fury, who asks the players to perform personal performances rather than their partners, as well as the only false slander to Jordan Series and Justin Thomas, who had won three points in four points.
Ferry has also seen two of the great athletes that walk the last day in the opposite direction, and Fury, who was part of the team that won in Brooklyn, had been defeated by the "The Wonder" of Europe.
On the last day, he replied, "I remember every part of it."
"We have 12 main matches tomorrow, but as we saw Brook line, you want to get a quick start, as you have seen in Medina.
As the speed goes another way, it's a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
We have prepared the line for that, and we have prepared the style of players in a way we thought we were right, you know, we're trying to get out of that magic tomorrow."
Thomas's duty to provide leadership has been passed on to other Europeans in the first half of the season, and he has been facing Roppy McColroy, Paul's case, James Ross, John Raham, and Tom Flitwood and Ian Pult.
"I went with this group in this Ord, because I think it contained all the routes," John told his segregates about the selection.
The new warfront commission was re-constructed again.
The German fleet was to have the most recent warship in 2014, in exchange for the warships that were used in the old and the Cold War, but the local media reports that it would not be held until the next year.
Despite the release of the "Renland-Fals" campaign, the new Badon-Turmberg class-class championship of warships, the DP for the release of the DP for the first half of the 2019.
The Navy himself had to have received this ship in 2014, but the situation that faced the fate of the proud project had been affected in the past.
The ancient Bremen-Clas were replaced by warships, the sailors' troops, in 2007, ordered four Banden-Urmberg Class ships.
These ships are known to have some secret techniques such as the strong artillery and the air-sized missiles, the ship-passing missiles, the infrade, and the ancastic cigars.
Another important feature of the long-term repair is that the construction of the motherland is to be completed from ports to two years, so the new warships must be maintained until two years.
However, the DKA seat suggests that the ships are allowed to express their power in foreign countries by the time of continuous delay when they enter service.
The F125 war ships faced the sentence were in place in the media last year, when they were officially rejected by the German sailors for commissioning ships, and the ships returned to Hamburg Bloom and Wosssch Yar.
It was the first incident in the history of the Navy's army to return to the shipmaker after the release.
No one knows the reason why the ship was sent back, but the German media reports that there is a number of critical "soph Weir, Hard Weir damages" and that it does not benefit from the war mission.
Soft Weapons are particularly important because a group of only 120 sailors in the old Bremen Class Warships are controlled by the new Band-Urmburg Class Warships.
In addition, information has come up with the ability of the sailors to transform the ship so that it will become too heavy for the ship and reduce the ship's performance.
It is believed to be that there are over 7,000 tons of weight that are more heavy than ships used by the German car in the Second World War.
If the wrong hard hardy hardware is altered, the entire project's cost - including the crew's training - becomes a problem.
Although the initial cost was expected to be pp.22.2 billion, it is now said to have reached 0.31 ($3.6 billion).
In the face of recent warnings, the ships of Germany are particularly important to the problems facing the most new warships.
First of this year, Hans-President Bartals, head of the Defense of the German Parliament's Defense Minister, admitted that in the Navy, "the ships in the military actually are missing".
The officials said that the problem is being complicated because the old ships are decommissioned and the water has not received new ships.
He was sad that not one of the new Badon-Wemburgs of the warships was of any use to the sailors.
National Trust in the Secret Life of bats
The goal is to learn how to use the wings of the forest for food, and a new research is taking place in an estate located in the hillland region of Scott Lane.
The findings are expected to be useful for obtaining new knowledge about the behavior of these flying adjectives and helping to guide them through future protective activities.
In the Inververve Gardens, West Rose, the study of the studies of the common bats and the Zopropostrates, and the long earring daubenture of the Browner.
During the course of the season, special records will be placed in the main locations around the estate to track the activity of bats.
The mobile survey will be conducted using ES Staf and volunteers who can walk with their hands.
The preliminary analysis of all recording sounds can help determine and identify the sound of the tail.
Then, a complex map and report will be prepared to create a detailed image in the face of the earth-view of the bats' behavior.
It is expected that the NEC's environmental advocate Rob Dever is expected to reveal the results of the survey that the most important areas of the habitat are and how they are used in the vulversives.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the care of the environment, such as the bat and other organed organisms, creating grass, and creating the very best of the woodlands.
In the past century, there have been significant numbers of bats in the castle and the UK.
Walls are threatened with threats from buildings that affect the places of depression and development.
The wind operates turbines and electric light paper and the chemical compound of the construction materials are threats to the wires.
Wings are not really blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting in the night, their ears are more useful in the catch of the prey.
They use very complex Eco-clopedation technology to determine the young and the advantages of flying paths.
The N SMS is considered very seriously responsible for the maintenance of 76,000 hectares of more than 270 main gardens and 38 main gardens.
There are ten experts who have been trained in this institution, who conduct permanent surveys, and conducting nest tests, sometimes rescue animals.
This organization has opened the first dedicated vala in the Trivia estates of the Third House of Scotland, and is located in Scotland, Scotland, where it is referred to as Galloway.
The estate manager David Thompson says this is an ideal location for the batters, and the estate manager David Thompson says it is an estate area that is located in the area.
"There's room for Wounds here in Tripa," he said.
"There are old buildings and lots of big trees and good habitats here.
But there are still many things that are still unknown about bats, so we can learn more about the activities we do here and in other episodes, and more about the things we need to be rich."
He emphasizes the importance of testing the bats before they make an repairs inside the buildings, because in error a mother can destroy 400 female bats and children, and sometimes the entire field may be eliminated.
To protect the bats here, it is illegal to kill or harm them or destroy their nests.
The Scottish officer of the Batsion Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has asked the public to help with the need.
She said, "We still have many more things to learn about our bats, we don't know how many bat species there are and how well their numbers become better."
The prosecutors denied the persecution of German journals and denied Ronaldo to seek compensation from the magazine.
He also stated that Christato Ronaldo, who had come out of the way, was "good news" by his name, and that he said that people have been making their own name known.
His lawyer is preparing to approach the Court against Der Spegue, the German news magazine published by the accused.
At the Las Vegas Hotel, in 2009, Ronald was accused of having played the American young lady by Kattin Maogue as an American woman in Portugal and in the United States as a Fortwar's.
The lady accused Ronaldo to pay $35,000 to prevent the incident from being released, which was reported Friday on Friday.
Within hours of the allegations, Intagram spoke to his 142 million photographers on video, and the thirty-three-three-year-old Ronald reports were struck by "the news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
They said today it's false news, " Five times the Balon d'Or was heated up in a stream of time.
"They want to gain popularity with my name.
This is natural.
They want to be popular with my name, but it's a part of work.
I'm happy, nothing's wrong" with smiling star.
In relation to the allegations, the prosecutors described Ronaldo's lawyer as "an illegal report about questions in the field of entertainment" by the prosecutor.
He added that "as far as the law is serious moral decay damage" would require relief by the director Chris Shertz, who is the founder of the star, "is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the time of the end."
It is said that in a suit in Palms Hotel and Cassino, Las Vegas, it is said that the incident that happened in June 2009.
According to documents dedicated to the Clerk County District Court of Nevada, the report says that Ronaldo was transferred to the room after meeting in the Night Club, where he was forced to take Ronald with him to the room of the Targent.
After the alleged incident, the genredo fell to his face and he claimed that he was a "90% "good man" and that he was "one cent" claimed that he had betrayed himself.
While Ronaldo confirmed that both had sex relations, the documents claim that it was unacceptable.
McGorge claims that he went to the police and took photographs of the injured in a hospital, but later admitted to a settlement outside the court because he felt that he was "expressed and confused" because he was afraid of being "a victim of revenge" and was afraid of being "respected."
Thirty-four said that the law is still under the control of the incident and that it is still in operation.
Ronaldo was leaving the United States at the time of the charged attack, and he was going to join the Paris Madrid, and this summer the Italian club was transferred to Juwell, the Italian club in the final 100 million dollars.
Brexit: UK will regret it all over for losing car producers."
After Brexton lost the status of the world's first place in the Car construction, the business Secretary of the United States said that it would be "a regret to me forever."
He added that BBC and Totota had said that if Britain left the Union without a deal, the factory would be suspended in Burton, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese Carmator said that if he was going to walk with no Dean, he would lose jobs due to the shock of time occurring in the states.
The Boston Plan, which was built by Toyota's Andes and Ays, was built last year, with about $150,000 cars of which 90% of the cars were loaded into the rest of the European Union.
"When Britain finally leaves the Union, it's my opinion that it's going to stop in our factory," said Mark Cook, editor of Toyo's Burton.
Other UK Carmamas, such as Housing and the American Union, have raised concerns about how the trade of the border will be carried out without a treaty.
For example, BMDBU says that the minimic plan for the Ox Sacks would be closed for a month after.
Despite the accident of Brexit, the main concerns that car producers say are related to the safety risks.
It is based on the "conclusional time" of Toyota's construction line, which reaches parts of the Tatota from the Union of UK and the Union.
On 29 March, if the UK leaves the Union without any concept, there may be a barrier in the border, because the industry says that the time of the division will cause famine and famine.
The company said it was impossible to store more materials than a day in Toyota's Democrat plan, so the construction would have to be stopped.
Clarke said that Theresa Mei's checker plan for the future relationship with the European Union was "pretently planned to avoid such trials in the middle of the year".
"We need a perception, not only to enjoy the current success, but we want to make a good impression that allows us to benefit this opportunity," he told BBC Radio's TV program.
"What we have is a very high-powered distribution network, and it is definitely the only way we have to continue as it is, to remind the evidence from Toyota not only from other producers".
Although Totota did not say how long it would stop, the company warned that in the long term, much costs would be reduced by the plan's competition and the resulting losses would be lost.
Peter Sullivan, the unit-in-law of the Plant, who has worked for 24 years in Burton, said that he was concerned that he would not return after these tasks were gone.
A government spokesman stated: "We have set up an accurate and reliable project in connection with our future relationship with the European Union."
White House will be late for the Trump meeting with Rosen Stein.
The White House Sunday said that as the Supreme Court continued to compete with Nominie Bret County, the deputy attorney was going to have "one week" for the main meeting with the General Roston General Roston.
The management of the activities of the Special Council of Special Council, Robert Thorns, who seeks to find out the involvement of Russia's electoral elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia, and the objections that are being made in the judicial system.
For months the Washington Kimwunds are fueled whether the deputy attorney will expel the general, whether or not he will be released, or whether he will be the owner's freedom.
The first month of the month was reported in New York Times about wearing a wire to record the conversations with Trumpa, and about the possibility of removing the president by twenty-inch changes.
Rosen Stein denied this report.
Despite the news that he was going to retire, he went to the Whitehouse last Monday.
Instead, on Thursday a meeting was announced with Trump in the United States Church of New York.
The Trump said he would not want to disband Rosenstein", but Trump said it would be to delay the trial of the Senate Masciary Committee, in order to avoid it at the time of the trial of the trial, as well as to be one of the women who accused him of being sexually abused during the trial, Dr. Christine Blasley and the witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI investigation for a week long-term search against Kanogue, and the entire Senate voted back again.
Trump's Secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday Fox News.
When asked about the eye with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet decided for it, I think it's possible this week to be put aside for a week by reviewing all other things that are in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I've always wanted to tell the media new information."
Some of the reporters will question the statement, but the White House has not conducted the press since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace searched for the reason.
Sanders said that the press's low-in-laws were not "transgregated to the group", however, they said: "I don't care about the fact that they're coming into groups."
She then suggested that the media and the Trump would be in direct contact.
"President manages more questions and decisions than his predecessors," they said, and added: "We have looked at their numbers."
The press will continue to be, and Sanders Series said, "If you have the opportunity to ask questions directly from America's president, that's better than speaking to me.
We've been trying to do it a lot of times and you've seen us doing it for the last few weeks, and you're going to speak directly to America's president instead of making press calls."

The value of experience and abilities shown by fellow workers from many parts of the European Union has been largely involved in improving the quality of the work of health services, thereby reducing patients and communities.

Twitcher hopes that this is the year it can be completed to 120 million pounds to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce this day that she will have to pay high stamps to help the homeless when foreign foreigners buy property in the UK.

The Tachishri goal is to earn up to 120 million in a year.
It buys 13% of the newly built London property from Britain, increasing the price and makes it difficult for those who buy the first time to enter the house-making field.
Several wealthy areas in the country â particularly in the capital - have become the "sublished cities," because there is a good percentage of foreigners who buy and spend more time outside the country.
The new policy comes after a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for to cut down the stamp duty to help help help support more young people win their first home.
He claimed that the massive construction companies did not possess the land but did not use it, and asked Mrs. May to leave the collection over the homes that were able to solve the Britain's "productation."

That means our broken house is being balanced.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here and work and build their lives.
However, it is not proper to buy homes easily like hard British residents to stay in Cambridge and foreign companies.
The dream that many people have their own home is too far, one well-known resident who can sleep, and one remains a real reality of this."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate wish is to control Scotland'
At one point, Scotland is to control its "anthropic ambition", says Sandland Boe Ross.
The challenge of raising the North-Est Club is to have the 42-year-old score at the third level in the league van.
After leading to St. Miranda Scottish Premier in the last season, he moved to the stadium of the lights.
"My ambition is to play for my country as a player.
I got a B Cap, that's all, "RBC tells Scotland's sports zone.
"But when I was a child, I grew up with my father, Scott Lane of Hamp, who always saw me as one of the ones that have always left me behind.
But only if I succeed in controlling the club."
Among the former generations of Rose as the Sandland manager include the Duck Advature, David Moss, Notres, Margaret O'Neill, Carin, Roschette, and Causlo de Connio.
Alova, former boss, says that he had no hesitation in being a successor to the names established in these big clubs, he had previously rejected the offer from the Baunz Li and Iptown.
'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League'? Now the victory will be determined for me.
The club's structure and facilities are no doubt included in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll see if I've won this club back there."
The Austrian Bosa and Harts' coaching stamps in Dumbledore had been spent only three years in his management life.

Rose says that her client, Hart Liverpool, Falkirk, and St. Miranda feel more happy than the sports in the area of Hamilton Academy.
"It may have been the real turning point, and he says, taking over the responsibility of "Leoyo".
"I really believed the management was more in agreement with me than I do.
It looks strange, but it's worth living with nothing to get to some heights.
But playing can be difficult.
We'll have to pass through a lot of things every week.
I still have work difficulties and stress, but the management is very good for me.
I always wanted to come to management, and I've come to it now, and I'm glad that I'm doing what I like in my good age."

Major factors that influence sales are climate and community sports programs.
There is no wonder that the restaurant groups are coming to nothing to worry about, however, there is a lack of pressure on the cost of 4.8% of the year's cost.
The summer's long-term comebacks for the food Leederators should also see whether the relatively moderate climate that comes to August is to be comforted".

Mothers are compared to cows by the Brest pump advertising leads to controversy in online.
The public was directed by a variety of opinions by the nursing mothers to feed milk fed cows.
In order to produce the title "Brest Pamp", the Confeder's company was broadcast by a interesting music video video for new pumps.
The music is portrayed in the place where 4 of these songs are set for the cattle, and its lines say: "Yes, I'm getting milk, but you can't see the tail." If you don't, I'll say, "If you don't notice, these aren't my breasts."
Corus says: "Do the pump, do the pump, I'll pump it for the babies, pump it up, I kiss the milk people."
However, this advertisement, published in the Fei Book of America, led to online controversy.
This video with 77,000 views and hundreds of volumes directly deals with different responses from the Ausperators, and most people say that the diary's "decision" is said by the economist.
"It's a bad decision to use cows to publicize this production.

The LV is a preliminary pump (LV/'Ma') and a very good nurse Singhie can be placed within the inside of the brand.
Another commented: "The mother and the child became very hard to understand that it was just the same.
But why don't you use them to announce the Bresp for mothers who are breast-feeding?"
Another added: "A non-impressive advertisement".
Others agreed on the public, and said a woman song was "a lot of fun".
"I think it's a good idea.
If I had just breastfeeded now, I would have done it.
I felt like a cow when pumping.
The public's getting a little past, but I accept it as I have.
It's a good product," one related.
Another commented: "The mother who pretends to be "published and cows" (Some time in the workplace and the toilets) was a interesting public.
It's not about praising the milk industry or being criticized."
The end of the video is revealed that all the women dancing had made pumps in the brand.
It is the idea that the women who blow the Bretts pumps feel like cows.
However, the LV is quite comfortable, and there are no wires or tubes, and there are no tubes, and it will be firmly fixed within the nurse's Singh branch, which gives women the freedom to walk, take the children, and go out as soon as the pump is done.
Madar's partner and ECD U.S. Lieutenant says: "Lvi PÃ©mp is a revolutionary product, and it's only a bold start.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers and cows, we've only tried to bring Bresspang with it into the light, showing the new pump's freedom in a very interesting way.

So we were only trying to get rid of them," Mr. Albenns said.
In order to expose the children's case, officials had made new rules, and they would have to appear in court within a month that would keep them in accordance with them, and the Shelters say it was 60 days.

The heavy-term mix flows the money out of the house competitions
It is not surprising that there is a flow of money in Pennsylvania in the 17th century because it brought two officers into competition for the same position as the regulatory districts.
The recently refueled pysburg Democrats are holding the Corona Lamp, who had won the seat in another district in the past.
Lamp competes as another officer, Katharphu, who is presenting the 12-second district in the old Perisania, which now lies beyond the 17th district.
The Supreme Court of the previous January was determined by the ruling of the Supreme Court that the old districts have misconstituted the constitutional Republican Party's favor.
The new 17th competition between the Democratic Canal Conference Committee and the National National Republican Community (NRCC) was launched into the financial rivalry between the United States Party (NCC).
With the success of a small majority in the special election of the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, the Lampe became a noted name in Pennsylvania.
The seat was the Republican Party, which was built over a decade, and was succeeded by President Donald Trump 20 points.
Political scholars have given the Democrats a minor victory.

However, in 2017, it was considered only against El Salvador, who received a $140 million aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.

In response, the diplomats commented that the main minister, who is responsible for the gathering, transferred it to the center of October, was to include high officials in the administrative area.
In addition, three American representatives, without new messages or punishments, have returned to the domains of Elsadore, without Panama.
