Civil Rights Movement issues travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Preference of Colored People (NAACP) has published a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Recommendation, effective August 28, 2017, calls upon African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of contentious racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state,” the organization said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step under Missouri's current laws, which make it difficult to defend racist acts in court, as well as due to actions by law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police officers just because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed," NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
“We’ve had the largest number of complaints so far.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and being thrown into custody by police without charge of a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement from the Missouri Attorney General’s Office that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should bring money with them to pay the deposit or to warn their relatives that they are going to travel through the state."
According to current figures from the FBI program, there were 100 hate crimes reported in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
The model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family is not at peace!
Model Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant she worked at.
The victim and the killer had sex and smoked marijuana before killing her.
The killer then sat in a nearby coffee shop and watched the careful criminology work of a crime scene search.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted assaulting a teenager in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found the girl already dead on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing on a fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he claimed falsely.
According to his testimony, the girl had to defend herself as much as she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie, and she blamed him.
After confessing, Dixie talked about his horniness and taste for a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally, he was at his ex-girlfriend's, they drank alcohol and took cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces more attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
So cruel are the people who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror's mother, Linda, about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prude nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimacy boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
“There were different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different,” she tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of erotic design aids Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When a companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs a boutique called Intimacy in Prague’s Benediktská Street, where she sells erotic gadgets the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
These are also design items.
Wait a minute, that's what you're talking about at lunch, you say?
Oh, come on, don't be such puritans!
Designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, the Berlin-based Fun Factory was an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone here is used to.
No hidden shop windows, all done in a beautiful, understated style, products exhibited more like in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to handle a Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
They both liked the name Intimacy.
“It’s related to intimacy, and it’s kind of, you know, tender,” she says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant that spread the store into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom dominated by the bed won.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn’t seem ideal to us, because he wasn’t on the main street, but it made him sit next to the name of Intimacy.
He's intimate.
He is in the alley next to the main one, so no one is looking at the customers," Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of themselves for even entering such a business.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to the sex shop.
Right at the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only female staff in the store, it does not mean that women should not be afraid to ask for help.
Mostly gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't guess the right size and prefer a bigger one," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
It's the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, while a woman usually tends to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product appropriately called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the expression on my face that I don’t know which is beating because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
I struggle with the adolescent need to be amazed at the serious tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's not like it's coming.
And it doesn't really spoil.
It is at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He took care that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe couples vibrator.
He has completely dismantled taboos that may persist in some men, namely, that he sees erotic aids as competition.
“There are different options,” he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose gadgets and buy classic vibrators, even though they only use it externally.
In Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer the men," Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The masturbator is mainly sold, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but “more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan it is completely different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese people were very fond of sex toys, I object.
“That’s the reality of the internet,” he explained.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, sex toys are more related to being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for fun - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not very cool.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Unlike other countries, such as Italy and Poland.
The typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience with both sex life and some aids.
Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of her return by making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to get into specials such as bondage and latex, because we do not have space for it, either.
Such things might discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to a sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look at them.
Many of the products on display are really attractive.
It is also determined by the selection of renowned brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first-ever award winner was the aforementioned seahorse "and it triggered a change in the entire industry.
They began to abandon cheap materials and work with harmless health, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that some of them are designed by a Czech woman, the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how many people buy the Whoop.de.doo design stuff from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Anna Marešová’s Venus Balls.
She really did a huge amount of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to be in control of the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it is not a mass production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may go against the current, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could well happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me the situation, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
At the most, people are embarrassed.
"But even then they will start to smile." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator in her offer, where you can have a personal message made, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant gel.
Next year we will have vibrating eggs and more.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's right lie.
Is there anything that Martin doesn’t sell anymore?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we rather define ourselves by a range of branded manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a final question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail arrived in which a lady was asking for a masturbator for her twenty-eight-centimeter-long natural boyfriend.
I had to say that unfortunately we don’t have that.
The question is whether anyone made fun of us," Martin measured me with a suspicious look.
This also happens from time to time...
It's a shot for Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is battling a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," the singer himself confirmed the sad information of Lightning.
I am aware of my illness and have been able to cope with it for the time being.
"I take medications to slow down the accompanying phenomena of the disease," he added, thanking those close to him for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Wife Eva is trying to be at home as much as possible, as well as daughters Zuzana and Tereza from her first marriage to her father in Bílá Hora.
Generous twice struggled with cancer and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him during his demanding treatment.
He has had 60 chemotherapy treatments.
He was able to return to work on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"I've been told by an astrologer that I'll be here until I'm ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
The actress Květa Fialová is already struggling with the same disease.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer’s?

The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will assess the ÚS.
In Chile, there is an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be done for health reasons.
"I am sorry that lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now 10 people will be deciding what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," Senator Isabel Allende said in a statement.
Chile’s Constitutional Court has 10 members and is expected to have a new president by the end of August, close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The bill abolishing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition said it would challenge the law in court because it violates the unborn child’s right to life.
The vote on the bill was postponed until it was analysed by a joint parliamentary commission last month.
On Wednesday, lawmakers approved the bill, and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be punishable in three cases: if a woman’s life is in danger, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949, according to the Spanish newspaper El País.
An absolute ban on abortion was imposed by the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1989, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world with an absolute ban on abortion.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars serving up to 30 years in prison for aborting a pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything sacred?
Trump's White House target now is the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could tell the story just as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key proponents of the Trump regime, must have known what was going to happen when he took a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty in a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants.
It is fair to say that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this he would be lynched by the crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal in 1903, not until 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying: “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
A poem that has been placed on the pedestal additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he put it, this isn't about history.
This is especially striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - he invites not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest of the poor: "Let me come, who falls, who the poor, who can hardly breathe freely, who a miserable worm in the middle of full cities."
And it is in modern times, better than ever, that we can watch these “honey worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a sweeping political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classical theme, i.e. the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Merging the poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptizer on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty isn't really inviting anyone into the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the underdeveloped world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It brings the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States."
Strangely, Limbaugh points to an important point.
The significance of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of a exhausted and damned traveler who, often after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives in a new country with hope in his heart.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to inflame hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black sings praises to Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said a strong squad of 16 Scots on the World Cup team would be "a huge asset to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London World Cup, which starts on Friday.
Black believes there is “something special going on” in Scotland and that British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on that," Black said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they have done.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected as the team's captain.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening statement was amazing," said Black.
Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and undisguised feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400 m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record for 1983 and 2015 was seven.
Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
At the World Championships, he will take part in the 1500 m and 5000 m races.
Another of the great Scotsmen is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500 m track. This season he won the British Team Races and Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, at which she was the only other Scottish team member Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was “very proud” of the fact that not only did a large number of her colleagues make it to the team, but in many cases they would also be attacking for participation in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about being the team captain is that I was elected by the other team members, and it’s been a great honour for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is very gratifying,” she added.
“Obviously I’m very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It shows where we've moved.
They are athletes who will think of the top spots on the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it's a good one.
I just drew attention to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship, because it takes place on home soil.
“It’s important to take advantage of the support of our home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I’m going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: don’t run for public office if you can’t stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to criticize him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
This criticism did not leave her cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and the stupid and dumb will be led like sheep to the slaughter."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work hard to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for these actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as gratuitous, and there were many "who cares" opinions in comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an immensely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not irritable.
As can be seen, he governs his state with certainty of his own and strictly observes the principles.
He has also been shown to be adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters, with the exception of posting the first bare-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people from visiting the governor's site - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his taxpayer-funded staff - is pointless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderating posts.
However, using images of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts were deleted.
And that's what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone stated, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in a section with comments to The Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s staff called “concentrated spam interest” others would probably call “defence.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
This is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require the posting of employees on the streets, where they would collect and burn all the copies with criticism, or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what happens, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who were denied access to his account.
One of the first important ordinances was born last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairman violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, where she barred one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
At the time of Washington, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even back then, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers questioning Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents gathered by people within the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have piled up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent, and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader has to accept that.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, using more data abroad than at home.
Czechs use more of their tariff abroad than they do at home.
Most of them are in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to recent O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate basis than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where there are few visitors during the winter, data consumption has increased by 50 times this summer season.
Italy ranked second in the list of consumed data.
Most Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
“The transferred data could hold tens of millions of photos,” said Silvia Cieslarová, director of O2’s mobile segment.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, which we do not have so much time to browse on the Internet.
"Across Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslarová said.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data after the release of roaming charges, the growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes roaming has doubled since last year.
Germany dominates by a huge margin over other countries.
"Roaming calls are used by business customers on business trips," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for a Homely Atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxing atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in Scotland’s East Lothian district, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales on his way to the final last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course. This year, he will play the role of the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club grow before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the course.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an avid advocate for the game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in good hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend the title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about this," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because one year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golfing.
I remember last year, when Sharon really meant a lot to me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time that I will not forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, is returning home after 50 years.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I always like to play at home,” Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to do well and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I’m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”
The three players will also be joined by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. The parking fee is 5 euros for a car with one passenger and 10 euros for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a frying pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and enjoy it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Late-night work poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers reside in the village.
“After 5:00 p.m., no one will be allowed to wander around the village,” Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in a form of public uproar in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and desolate city, which can be reached after a ninety-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-wrenching ride.
Mass transit doesn't work in this place.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have visited this place.
Prior to the arrival of Christians, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing this dress,” says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knit turban, dark T-shirt, and shiny skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy being among the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of America's Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province approximately the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of logging.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 found that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government are threatening this golden goose and are therefore being severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The mass murders in the Papuan tribal area during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - according to another report, particularly popular rape and electrocution - and brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s difficult to calculate the death toll because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation is aggravated by the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% are Christian, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from Indonesia's islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to survive.
“Immigrants have started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” said Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura province to work.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - have thus lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he will listen to our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs by a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the twilight of night on motorbikes.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the reprimand and tone, and later returned with four other soldiers, local parish priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with the butts of their guns, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby Electoral Commission building, and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which they run in a circle and imitate the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, soldiers were ordered via radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” according to the TIME weekly in an official document, the contents of which were never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Enarotali district of Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one listened to his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting,” he added.
One resident, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was shot three times.
“I ran to my body to make sure it was him,” Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely “providing” for the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said Pudjo Sulistiya, a spokesman for the Papuan police.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the murders slid through Jakarta's media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his understanding for the victims' families and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to resolve acts of violence that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, there were excuses.
“Most of the violence happened a long time ago.
Some of them happened in the 1990s and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in a June 5 interview for the TIME weekly, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he had no plans to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be brought to court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” after more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claims with mistrust.
“I’ve been asked four times in the last three years, but I haven’t seen anything yet,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
A few years later, he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says himself.
“I’m afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me.”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many of the Paniai residents, who are afraid to speak out about the incident.
He said he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me,” he said.
And the shooting is still going on.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A skirmish in which one person died and 17 others were injured occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting an unconscious man to a hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died en route to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's building.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the members and were given warning shots in response.
Local residents, however, claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began firing into the crowd, killing one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” 29-year-old Domingogu Badia, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal indigenous peoples who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai. They include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of Paniai in recent years, all under the pretext of “ensuring national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
The fire is fueled by poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is still unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potato cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already so few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to venture into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Due to the isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from the papui for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: not recognizing visas and being blacklisted," he said in a statement.
The lack of news from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the Papuan case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the allegations, telling reporters in Jakarta that "In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media are free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the local people shouted, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom".
More elections are planned in Indonesia for 2019, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a person who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting,” said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robber army - are wallowing in poverty, poor education and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote a “debt” that Jokowi must repay.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting continue their last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, he will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French navy has seized a 1.46-ton yacht worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment went to Australia.
The four crew members of the ship, believed to be from Latvia and Lithuania, were arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged by police to a port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
Australia's intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where the drugs were coming from and where, and to reveal a "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large quantities of drugs going to Australia," said Col Blanch, the country's executive director.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for smugglers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also grappling with the problem of the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors don’t feel thirsty; they need to be reminded to drink.
The problem could be in homes for the elderly, according to Pavla Mádlová, a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, an infusion of saline that is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only used in healthcare facilities.
The older a person gets, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"Moreover, they lose the feeling of thirst, so the elderly generally receive less fluid and become dehydrated very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two liters should definitely be drunk.
"But getting that much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In homes for the elderly, according to her, no doctor often watches it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
"I think it should be gradually introduced there as well, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, the elderly can be supplied with up to two half-liter bottles of saline.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache, and decreased performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"Someday the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs a blood vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet cover, at most, a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but the ideal would be to occasionally expose the patient and let the skin air out," she said.
The Torch is burning in Dubai for the second time.
One of the world's largest residential skyscrapers was on fire in Dubai on Friday, with firefighters having to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-story buildings.
This is the second fire in the high-rise building in the last two years, which bears the aptly named The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were sleeping and the alarm woke us up. We heard screaming.
It took us 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” said Geroge, a resident of the skyscraper.
The Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. GMT, whereupon they continued cooling the building.
Government officials added that they were providing alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could reignite debate over the safety of materials used to panel high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the 2015 fire showed that the most damaged were the linings and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and lining system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
Survey results show that more than one in five passengers in the U.S. passes prohibited items on board an aircraft.
A survey of passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unknowingly passed prohibited items through a checkpoint of the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they were belatedly found to have traveled with a firearm, ammunition or explosive.
The results of a survey conducted by the airline Stratos Jet Charters Inc., to which more than 1,000 respondents responded, showed that younger passengers were more likely to be in breach of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted they had attempted to consciously travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped TSA attention include food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents knowingly passed a sharp object through security, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to having intentionally carried banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among passengers around the world to determine how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through airport security and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, the majority of people who have transferred unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know how much fluid they can transfer to the plane.
Unsurprisingly, TSA seized the largest amount of the currently banned liquid.
For a time, people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Transport of liquids is allowed within domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on delaying plans to cut Obama administration emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief Scott Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan to respond more swiftly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position in the federal appeals court.
This concerns the latest deadline, set for October 1, when countries should start to comply with the 2015 regulation for reducing ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or threatened economic growth."
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma’s attorney general before President Donald Trump was installed as EPA chief, has long served as a staunch opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA’s executor had overstepped his authority in an attempt to delay incorporating the Obama administration’s plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
“Under the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation, and we take compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "are based on sound policy and the most accessible information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group does not intend to allow in legal coercion.
"The EPA's turnaround - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C. joined New York.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants, and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud Pruitt's sudden change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure we need to exert to change the minds of those in charge and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to grapple with the ideological pull of the Trump administration to help polluters and special interests.”
He spilled acid on the man, but he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and you're laughing, the next minute your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was etched with acid by an unknown assailant, who was finally acquitted.
This was reported by Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopheros' door.
Andreas stood up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man, whom he had never seen in his life, poured acid on him right after opening without warning, saying, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart on me like nothing and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned the terrible news - he had no chance of survival, according to doctors.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most excruciating thing I've ever experienced.
“You can’t hide from unexpected light, you can’t close your eyes,” he said.
Today Christopheros has had twelve operations, which are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and fight deformation and disfigurement throughout their lives,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused a close person.
The police investigated the case and then tracked down the attacker.
The man was initially sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the amazement of Christopheros' family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be lifted as the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of corrosive substances has increased considerably.
The Interior Ministry said it plans to set new guidelines for prosecutors regarding the classification of corrosive substances.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose tougher and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require tighter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as these are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the residents of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
According to another tenant, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards with hot debris falling.
We were asleep.
We woke up to the alarm, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George described the events.
Another witness told CNN that about 40 apartments were engulfed in flames.
A fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when burning parts of the building fell on them.
About two hours later, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
Witnesses said there was a power outage in nearby buildings.
The massive fire also damaged Dubai’s Torch Tower in February 2015, destroying more than 100 apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
No one was harmed because they were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and became the tallest residential building in the world at 352 meters.
The following year, another Dubai skyscraper broke the record.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito had a diverse collection of illicit drugs ranging from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record amount for caught athletes.
The third-person player, he says, started taking steroids the year before, when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging an ex-lover!
Lucka Vondráčková has barely set foot in the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also draws attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into the arms of her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and wanted a family.
Lucie was only 19 years old at the time and she certainly did not want to hang her career on the nail.
So they separated, but they remained friends to this day.
They also did this at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
By chance, they both came together in blue.
At first they did not notice each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal’s jokes until she fell down behind her stomach.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
Their meeting was not a coincidence, as they play together in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in prison in the UK for plotting an assassination attempt.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell called the Three Musketeers to life in prison for planning a terrorist attack against police and the military, prosecutors said.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
At the time, authorities believed he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions meaning "infidel" in Arabic, and a mock-up of a gun.
This happened while an MI5 agent was placing listening devices in the vehicle.
"Recent assassinations have shown how horrifying the defendants could have been if they had not been stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said in a statement.
Three convictions at the age of 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
A 38-year-old fourth convict can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed they were innocent and that weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In Hodonín they measured 38.3°C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it was surpassed by Thursday, which has become the warmest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, there were not many temperature records on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened for 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
Thursday’s temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice on Thursday's 37.4 degrees it exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice on Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the biggest heat in Dyákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but she did not break the record.
On the other hand, according to the CHMI website, Thursday’s highest temperatures in western and northwestern Bohemia have so far been only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures began to rise there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to CHMI, the current heatwaves in the Czech Republic will gradually fade away and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
However, high temperatures will remain in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of its visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing that.
State media are talking about a plan to turn tourism into a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
But the number of arrivals rose by just 3.8 percent last year, with about 80 percent of tourists coming to China from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, according to Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Beijing University, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of the other countries have to get their visas in advance.
In the United States, the crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours in line, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, just two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than 3 percent of China’s gross domestic product and less than 1 percent of the total population.
China often exacerbates this problem by using tourism to pursue its political goals, such as disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a spat around the South Korean missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Federal Reserve, China could leave as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China gains about $35 billion annually in sales of currency to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a tourism deficit of $217 billion last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s entire surplus in goods trade.
Thus, a small number of tourists inflict a very painful blow on a country that is anxiously hindering capital flight.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has ever heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.
There are many more cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads for immigration, has twice as much.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
It will be politically difficult to solve these problems, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts recently to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, they have bred deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the young of three rare and deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine of the newly born vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It is also growing in length," zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba said.
The cubs of the other two species, the Death Eaters and the Red Cobra, will be gaining strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Australia's eight snake-killers are the descendants of a breeding pair native to the Sydney area.
“The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the death-dealers from the Perth area,” Vobruba said, adding that in human care it is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
100% success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting cobras red.
A pair at the Pilsen Zoo hatched four young from four eggs.
"The incubation took 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
It is aimed at the eyes and can cause permanent blindness.
Babies of all three species feed on mouse sticks in the zoo.
Within 40 days, chicks from the black mamba are expected to hatch in the garden and eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls to the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peca Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay to build the proposed wall.
The US president accused him of publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and said Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee watchdog agreement bound for Australia was “ridiculous” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal - which came out of President Obama’s administration - he would look “drugged” after proposing a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most uncomfortable call of the day.”
Tusk again testified at the prosecutor's office over Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the brother of the dead president, PiS leader.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski will not frighten me," Tusk said, accusing the country's current leadership of trying to use the judiciary against political opponents.
As he left the prosecutor’s office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician 100 years.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski will not frighten me."
He says he doesn’t blame prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the justice system is meant to serve as a tool against rivals, opposition or people he doesn’t like, and I’m afraid I belong to that group.
He was interrogated for the second time.
The former prime minister was questioned by prosecutors for the second time, this time about the mistakes made during the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
There was also a change of bodies in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
“Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was supposed to serve Donald Tusk to become someone very important in the EU,” Kaczynski told Catholic television station Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk’s chances of winning the most important seat in the EU, which Poland has absolutely nothing to gain from.
Kaczynski also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things might turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but did not take note.
Tusk received an eight-hour hearing at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his subpoenas as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by associating him with various scandals.
The prosecutor's office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who fulfils the role of Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
Only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested alone at the EU summit against Tusk’s extension.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also let Warsaw down.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
This follows from the decree, which regulates the delivery of voting tickets abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update, which is currently under review.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said in a statement.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," the document reads.
The Decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than 100 Czech authorities will receive a ballot for the press.
It is their list that is changing.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will also be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar and Lusaka, Zambia.
Since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include a consulate general in Iraq’s Erbil and Chengdu, the capital of China’s Sichuan province.
The ballots will also be available to registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
So far, Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose their MPs in polling stations at embassies or consulates four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine by lot the region for whose candidates there is a vote abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when a decision was made among South Moravian candidates.
During the next two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen, just like this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At its premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 it was about 6,700, four years later it was 8,222.
Four years ago, 10,571 voters came to the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Recall Racist Lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by by bystanders in Monroe, Georgia, and plowed toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled a long cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
“We want that n-and-Roger!” shouted the man.
“Bring it to me!”
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man being pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is only a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose over “Roger’s” neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have returned to Moore’s Ford Bridge to reenact the fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kuklux Klan.
No one has yet been tried for the murders.
"It's surprising that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Brooks said in a statement.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights campaigner.
In his eyes, the reenactment of the event presents a dramatic call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but above all justice," Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.”
The medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were to attend the lynching.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates say both the politics and sex were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court granted Georgia blacks the right to vote for the first time in an election scheduled for the summer.
It was during the summer election that black farmer Roger Malcom allegedly stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester during a skirmish, according to the FBI.
In the city, according to Brooks, it was rumored that Hester was having sex with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison posted a $600 bail for Malcolm.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Returning from the prison, just before the entrance to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
“As it turns out, Harrison planned and orchestrated the murders,” the FBI concluded.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement officials, who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made the point more succinctly.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: ‘This is what you’ll get if you sign up and vote.’”
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge has been organized for nearly a decade by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is figurative, engaging, and concise, showing a deep-seated racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
“Nobody wants to talk about lynching, because in doing so, we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that lurk in each of us,” Greene said.
“But we can’t have a relationship unless you listen to what I’ve been through.”
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - rushed into the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Assistant Director.
For many years, he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but in his words, the role is exhausting.
“I have a bad feeling about this because it contradicts who I am,” Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, respectively Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show begins with a skirmish - Malcolm argues with Hester and accuses him of having slept with his wife.
"Get off my property, N-E!"
Rascon's no good.
There's a skirmish going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) burst out laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
“What happened?” asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I being too rude?
“No,” Greene replied cheerfully.
“I just don’t think white people used to say ‘n-r’ in that tone.”
"Exactly," one of the black actors blurts out.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the performance to be authentic, just to make it worth four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The screams, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are almost the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple has traveled all the way from Ithaca, New York, many bystanders are from nearby.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point, murders could have been viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunted.
With the last words of the song, Greene prompts a crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to their victims' heads, watch fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy grumbles.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick hugs his two actor friends and cries in their arms; eventually, emotions come over him.
“It’s all right,” one of the women whispered.
“I know you hate this role.
But you had a reason.”
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
“It’s difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous acts ... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue,” she added, adding that “it’s just called police skirmishes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom enjoying his dinner talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience, but it’s also a moment for reflection,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times long ago, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first record player contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphics showing the wiring of some parts, all of which had some secret marks.
When something went wrong inside me years later, I offered the document to the shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a smirk he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid in chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl badges again.
New times have brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where it simply stuck to a sliced grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Especially good was a sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-piece and another procedure was simply not possible.
Putting it in reverse took considerable effort with the need to break certain plastic components.
My disdain for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon.
The year of production 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the indicator bulb.
It was simple.
Three steps and the work was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the tutorial neglected to state that while the bulb on the right went really only in three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. unscrew the cracked bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Put the cover on.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting my right upper limb into the car I would find a spring, a screw that would easily remove the cover and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
Footbridge error.
The cover had no place, no room even for Cinderella's slender hand, let alone the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life without any success.
The condition was exacerbated by the entrance of my wife into the garage, which was called by the roar and the words which she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?"
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I leave out the vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
“And why is it taking so long?” she risked in a sentence that might be her last in a long-lasting union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, placing the main emphasis on the procedure of the author’s torture of the instructions, where blessing with hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then comforting her so that she could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of instructions of the Hammer of Witches, including its commissiononal burning on the top of Losiny Castle.
"How about removing the box?" said the woman, removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, this happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
That was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just waking up from a collapsed state after checking two officials of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell even wild stories in an unaroused voice.
“I’ve been fined for not having a hand washing instructions posted,” he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I dug out the whole problem, which consisted in the fact that above the sink in the patient's toilet does not have a picture guide how to wash your hands.
His argument by a commissary official that adults usually wash their hands and that they do not need pictograms to cope with the usual activities of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
“It’s not just that,” she told him.
He understood that simply washing hands with running water is a primitive act on the level of Cro-Magnon, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to let go of the tap water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is joyful to find out that a person washed his hands exactly as ordered by Hosudar from SÚKL.
Finally, I have to say that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the operation of the toilet.
In the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, with urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
The problem remains the pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage in a prudish toilet visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he has wiped the hole with a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson to cut 3,000 more jobs and cut dividend in bid to boost business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, followed by the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of its previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by an additional 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost reduction program in an effort to revive declining business as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it reported a one-percent increase in base sales in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh city district.
This month Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in an explosion at a Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Tuesday's blast came after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan military, was attacked by "a local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement said all wounded soldiers were out of danger and were in a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
The growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a significant source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining an already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops who should help the country's military and police.
The suicide bombings, which have shaken public confidence in the government, its regulations and President Ashraf Ghanin’s reputation in recent weeks, have been reported by reporters.
EPA reconsiders decision to delay smoking rules in response to lawsuit
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to delay an Obama administration bill that ordered states to cut emissions just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to cede “Ozone Standards 2015” on Wednesday night, saying it is presenting the agency’s commitment to cooperation with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,” EPA director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced EPA efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures from Democrats and conservative groups worried about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA says on its website that breathing ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár was hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this relatively new singer in our country in June of this year, when this previously unknown singer held a monstrous event in the Czech Republic, where he hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was hosted by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show themselves to the public and to present their music video for the song Sara, which was christened by the aforementioned personalities.
Few people know, however, that the filming of the video clip itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it was not without a big embarrassment.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
Because of the dramatic nature of the scene, the singer's sock was supposed to indicate a slap in the face in the video.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I did not expect it, immediately blood came from my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers discussed the situation on the set that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not manage to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not severe enough to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
We now bring you the video clip of the young artist, in which you can also record the scene with a punch.
An unspoken version with blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko discussed the possibility of a duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting light-weight boxing match, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each was located in a separate room in ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated lightweight World Boxing Council champion - walked down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, the two boxers made the list of the top five light-weight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 7 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers, and Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer duel would be a “perfect test.”
“I’m a former featherweight champion,” Garcia adds.
“I had to gain weight because of the game with Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small for my 63 kg.
I want to go back to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to get light weight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not do it to them."
Lomachenko agrees.
Boxing would be good for this game.”
Klimas made a demand for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomačenko should make his debut in light weight at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in a match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on September 23 for the light weight title in the arena.
“The match should be paid per viewing, that’s what the fans want,” Garcia said, who later said he was open to the possibility of airing the match on the television station that would come up with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else gets that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could attend his match on Saturday.
Lomachenko, however, did not allow himself to be lulled by Garcia’s praise when he said that the champion of three divisions from Riverside looks “very slow... sorry Mike, but you’re asking for a knockout.”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension ahead of the duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game gets as much attention.
And I will be very happy to put it on the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match."
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
There was a lot of searching, but without success.
The police eventually closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the story came to a sad end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in Cheboksary, Chuvash.
Only thanks to the documents that were left in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived underwater for a decade, without which it would have taken the police much longer to establish the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by a frozen road running along a river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be released after it is completed.
Latest test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were interviewed as being over 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R?ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests conducted between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18, while a further 25 cases were judged by the Forensic Medical Agency to be “possibly over 18.”
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was “possibly under 18 years of age.”
Tests are only taken if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan Goransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond with the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are still on track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying that in 442 cases, “the person in question is 18 years of age or older.”
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the interviewee said he would turn 18 this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, has also been criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which is concerned, among other things, with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person passed puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine age with accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise,” he told Metro.
The agency said: “In general, the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the interviewee is just under 18 years old, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all interviewees."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico over the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that the funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to the transcripts of interviews published by The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically reprimanded Pena Nieto for taking a critical stand on his plan to build the wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressed the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
“You can’t tell the press that,” Trump repeatedly said in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to make defiant statements.
The funding will work out and it will work out in the end.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to see you guys anymore because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall is the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important thing.
Trump issued an executive order shortly after taking power.
Mexico has rejected the construction and funding of the 3,200-kilometer wall, which has strained relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States for the time being.
Trump met with his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's January 28 phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House said the conversation was ridiculous.
He was prompted by an exchange of views on a deal under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in people from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later accepted it.
“You can certainly say that this is not the deal you made, but you’re going to have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, a phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
“You’re worse than me,” Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation sharpened.
“I hate receiving these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
“They’re not going to be great people going to work for local milkers,” he said.
He also said he could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump held telephone talks with a number of world leaders at the end of January, roughly a week after arriving at the White House, often several in a single day.
Calling Turnbull was the least pleasant part of the day.
Before ending it, he stressed that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed in front of the crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim a tiny Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped and strangled her with his bare hands.
He also raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has hit an entire country, facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the thousand-headed crowd that gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under sharia law.
The victim's father shared his feelings with the media after the execution.
I feel reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
Other members of the family were also present, shouting with the crowd the slogan "Long Live Justice".
A police van brought the rapist to the square, from which he was dragged.
The police put him on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon on him and opened fire from close quarters.
The crowd cheered every shot that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed," he added.
I was standing on Liberation Square in Sana waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the mob gathered in the square would fall into hateful madness, grabbing the killer and lynching him.
The execution was ordered by the court, which is under the administration of the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act caused such outrage that the judge decided to use the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would have been more merciful to Morning.
"Our family has no enemies and the wounds that carried Rana's body were horrific," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police the same day, we told the newspaper and all our TV stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of a horrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held and demand immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The accused did not appear to have shown remorse for his actions.
Just before serving his sentence, the police read him the sentence, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings made on the Internet by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor Announces Political Party Change
Democratic West Virginia Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at President Trump's rally that he is switching sides.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their back on me,” Governor Justice said.
“Today, after much prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, that I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor.”
The crowd exploded in joy.
“I’m going to join the Republicans tomorrow,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to jump into another game."
Trump has previously promised people an important announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
His wealth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night saying, "The defection of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of working to elevate our country."
“For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is the last straw for an already impoverished leaderless party that is vainly pursuing a positive and unifying message,” RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia’s ‘sincere’ apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
The head of Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sports was correct and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia had supported doping for its athletes.
“I think we saw a very honest response and presentation today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the council and the congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working with all its might to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation."
Coe said he was also “delighted” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been very successful and we have taken it to the next level, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the Crisis Staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our aim has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones," he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins in London on Friday, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with strict IAAF rules will compete under a neutral flag.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it could be allowed back in.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory and the expelled coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation.
CzechTrade has been awarded a state contract by František Savov, whose state prosecutes.
The public contract of the state export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and demanded his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, CzechTrade, a pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, announced a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to Mladá fronta Entrepreneur František Savov.
Czech police charged him with tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
News server Aktuálně.cz drew attention to the case.
According to the original criteria, 60 percent of the offered price and 40 percent of the remaining beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project, should decide on the award of the contract.
Savov’s company was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
As a result, it was moved to the next candidate, the publishing house Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated at CZK 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received an under-average rating from the judges in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the news server Aktuálně.cz, belongs to the Economia publishing house.
VLM has filed several objections against the result of the tender, considering its evaluation to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to contest the competition at the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office for the Protection of Competition.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the public contract based on a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favoring the Mladá fronta, a.s. participant, to the detriment of the proposer and other suppliers," reads the proposal for the initiation of the procedure filed at the Office for the Protection of Competition this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the ranking of the selection committee appears to be unreliable and a 100% evaluation of the Mladá fronta project by all its members appears extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," Klima told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," Dlouhý told Dotyk.cz.
The Mladá fronta responded with a statement saying it considered it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house had intervened in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the article.
The tender could have been helped by the fact that it provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Cuba ODS.
František Savov has been accused by police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to extradite him since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, a London court rejected Savov's extradition appeal, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not gone anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the UK regarding the acquisition of the legal force of the judgment," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Prague City Public Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to ownership of the Mladá fronta, Savov was involved in Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company that controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and Maraflex, a Cyprus-based company that profiles itself as an investment fund buying endangered assets.
He would also control the failed Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly Legios, which owes more than CZK 3 billion.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker drove along the sidewalks and through the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by reckless driving along streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to get away in the direction of the station.
"Police followed the man cautiously through the town when he did not manage to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove the motorcycle into the field where it crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to come to the accident, transporting the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Later, police found out that the biker did not have a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number was polished and the production label itself was removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under investigation.
"The breath test excluded the presence of alcohol in the driver's seat, but a positive result was found for the substance methamphetamine," a police spokesman said.
How the Financial Rules of Football Will Affect Neymar's Move to Paris
Rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are a few financial terms for Neymar's move to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family who have become wealthy on energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini when he was appointed UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs in pursuit of new reinforcements were ultimately cheating and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP's rules shifted its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend exorbitant sums for y players to build a global brand - suddenly wasn't so profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin is determined to advocate a ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for Neymar’s redemption in a one-time payment, it may spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's top sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG was fined 60 million euros ($82 million) - which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and the order to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Thus, even though the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be reimbursable from the 2022 FIFA World Cup organizing committee in Qatar, according to some reports.
PSG and officials at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, however, denied a fat that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
UEFA officials said Tuesday that it has not opened an investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as he is not allowed to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ for the club and the state,” Javier Teba, president of the la Liga, told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the club’s ownership by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's stance on financing the club.
“This is the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“Once a club owner becomes a club owner, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in their club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
16,000 cheering fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky goes to the set.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Red Star, invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim for black.
The Letná team, pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening double match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything else with the match after Belgrade’s goal?
After the goal, we had to score four goals, which was difficult for us.
We wanted at least not to lose, to raise our confidence so that we had something to bounce back from in the next matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why did Sparta fail to get into the game for so long?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The opponent's combination was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot once in half time.
Of course, that’s not enough to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you need to push your opponents into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the assembly?
Of course, this is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We have only played three matches and the line-up is still changing.
It's about finding the perfect eleven to sit on.
Are you excited to have played two games in a row?
They are still just parts of the game.
I don’t know when I’ll be able to play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, there's no other way.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
It was a wonderful visit again, just like with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember seeing him like this when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be an advantage for the league?
So far, we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur should serve 10 years for extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is supposed to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion.
The estimated damage amounted to CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the justice system had violated his fundamental rights and that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges said the complaint was unfounded, CTK found from the court’s database.
This is not another court of appeal.
"As a fourth instance, it cannot judge factual or legal errors allegedly committed by ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The sentence imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which corresponds to the damage incurred, according to the verdict.
The High Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service from 2005 to 2008.
The damage amounted to CZK 645 million in the period January to July 2008 alone, with the total loss exceeding CZK 1 billion, according to the expert.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly payments of VAT and excise duty in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, she paid taxes in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded are related to the entrepreneur Radomír Vybíral, whom the judiciary has sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT fraud in fuel stores.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
"Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play nostalgic strings
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters of the famous 1980s; and for the filthy 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter put on MTV's "The State" comedy sketch); and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd fled to larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the perspective of the franchise, however, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of the absurd humor (an example may be the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables, which was voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later", in which adults play adults do not push so much on an emotional level, and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of the 1990s thrillers like "Hand on Cradle".
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbook junk, roller skates, and “a lot of other 1991 stuff.”
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The good-natured Coop (Mr Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is instigated by George H. W. Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially entertaining to watch the eternally long-haired young Rudd, aka Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once-respected character Andy is now an old pepper.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, such as the return of the series "Seven Up" until it achieves what I suppose will be a logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the whole group will go to the premiere of "Summer to Survive".
Meanwhile, “Comrade Detective” on Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of “Such Normal Americans,” the movie “Atomic Blonde: No Regret,” and even the series “GLOW,” in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes clash.
Directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak is set to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from 1980s Romania who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - tenacious Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street, who voiced the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series has been voiced by many well-known actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali, and Chloe Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama -- which includes the Reagan masked killer -- and so it seems.
Six long episodes is too long and comedic moments are not enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire in the "Comrade Detective" could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose lobby two fatties devour hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message to an imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The fictional Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes have not been able to get away from the IAAF.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) has extended an international ban on Russian athletes due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The vote in the World Cup, which will start on Friday, was very clear.
166 delegates voted in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is mainly the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the implementation of the anti-doping system, as stated before the Congress by the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban should continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have yet to be heard, and there are still coaches working in the country with a tarnished reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA is already able to conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes lost last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, among other things.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to compete in national colours, and if they win, they will not be able to play the Russian national anthem.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by lackluster economic growth and a weakening of inflation that has stifled speculation about a sharp rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “in the background” in terms of keeping interest rates up despite squeezes on family budgets.
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25 percent. The results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported a lackluster economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the decline in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years due to inflation caused by Brexit, and it also said that rents from business should rise more than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to withdraw part of a mammoth package designed to boost the economy that was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, a futures financing plan is expected to come into effect from next February, offering cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer 15 billion euros less than planned.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and a burden on consumption.”
On the subject of interest rates, the bank said it would need to “tighten the belts on monetary policy” to calm inflation “to a greater extent” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first increases in the third quarter of next year and further increases in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “smooth” and “limited”.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
Expected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth, with GDP stalling at 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a small consolation for households hit by rising inflation and miserable wage increases. The bank said that the situation will worsen before the increase.
The report also states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” revenue cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise “significantly” toward the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow due to high interest in British goods due to the weak pound, compensating for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will take at least four years to fully unify prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank said the excess relative to the 2% target was "completely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a good year-end outlook.
The market looks particularly good for those ending up with existing contracts and re-mortgage - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Starting in September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ treatments to prevent HIV, following a Supreme Court ruling on funding for the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to fund a trial period after an appeals court backed the Supreme Court's ruling last year, saying the NHS had the funds to pay PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign up to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GPs in the UK can also apply at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers for ?10 million, and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It’s another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust, said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
When administered correctly and to patients at risk, PrEP will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, NSH will offer patients who are at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to receive this statement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be to quickly deploy tests across the country; we need to ensure it is available to every patient.
We now have PrEP, a trial drug, and we are well on our way to protecting the more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to end the spread of HIV in society together.”
High Leg Life: Mezzanine and Smart Design Turn This Tiny Apartment into a Spacious Home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a big house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne Smart Terrace, it showcases a modern design that makes the most of the space available.
“Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him and gave him a nod the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from the Duck & Shed design studio based in Notting Hill and used the almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high that two gaps could fit above each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to organize both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bend the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and at the same time add to the drama.
On the mezzanine, the beautiful living room overlooks the old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the folding door.
“We had to figure out the technical side,” Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
“The doors are fitted with a counterweight, so that it is very easy to roll off.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne got another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is living space - or valuing your property," Erfan said.
“Basically, a real estate agent will calculate its price on the basis of the living space when entering an apartment.”
In this case, we managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the electricity on the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart will not win."
As it turned out, the quality design and increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional piece of work.
And like Joanne, you can choose to stay.
The United States is splitting up.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.
California has imposed a travel ban on its citizens from Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and issued a retaliatory travel ban for its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned state money from traveling to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee passed a conscientious objection law, under which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not required to provide it to them, but has an obligation to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that make it illegal for religious charities that receive children for adoption from mothers to provide them for same-sex couples to adopt.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned funding for its citizens' travel to the eight states of the union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to science symposiums in Texas, for example, reimbursed by their universities because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens’ travel from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee has run out of patience, and its parliament has passed a law that says it doesn’t like California’s policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it still doesn’t impose a travel embargo on California.
He's imposing them in retaliation for a California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
He also called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
Here are the facts, now the comments.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to legislate on conscientious objection, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what it cannot go to.
Secondly, what is wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can’t he just offer beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty of punishment when butchers offering pork are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and not leave him alone and order the cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies in non-federal powers according to their own, i.e., the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and letting live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
“No one should ever again show moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of LGBT lifestyles, and if they do, they should be criminalized.”
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don’t know of a situation in American history where states have done this on purpose because of political issues, except in the case of one.
Even at the time of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1850s, the political case was slavery, and the war of the North against the South was imminent.
Of course, this will not happen now, but the situation is toxic nonetheless.
The cultural and political divide between blue-democratic states and red-republican states is widening, and the U.S. is becoming mentally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin’s critics received a fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the presidential election campaign next year.
The court fined him for calling on people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for head of state in March next year.
The acting head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is widely expected that he will do so and will win again.
Navalny said police came to his home this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling for demonstrations through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is believed to be an anti-corruption campaigner, said the verdict was politically motivated.
The court also imposed fines of 300 thousand rubles and 25 thousand rubles on two members of the Naval pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin, on Thursday.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are doing everything they can to prevent Navalny from campaigning.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal in May.
The sentence is thus final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than $500 million.
Now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire, the two brothers are wrangling over one of the most expensive Victorian properties, worth more than $500 million.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak Manor, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over joint property and business fortune all the way to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly being litigated before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
On this site, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the company for $85 million.
With the money, additional properties were purchased, and the De Lutis family's portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who Paul calls "a significant driving force and dominant figure" in the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court records state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate, while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, the division of property and funds became problematic.
"Colin's proposal came out strongly in my eyes in his favor," Paul wrote in an affidavit to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at conciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also vying over who will control the existing business - from which, he said, Colin cut off.
Colin counters that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails, and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding in attorneys, including Allan Myers, QC, and both-party attorneys.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been running milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and had bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised by the estate, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was just a little, like, 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped the transfer of property to the sons would go well.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family of companies. Colin stated that Mark was compensated with $10 million on his departure, and Luke with $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded via text message, stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being heard in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court,” he wrote.
In a statement to the court in mid-2016, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
“Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, there was no hope in sight.
“Our disputes will be settled soon by a court hearing,” Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
The teachers shower the children.
Drivers of public transport are fasking water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where about 35 children are currently attending, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery has been renovated and the planted trees do not yet provide much shade.
There's no pool, but teachers shower in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds are drawn and the curtains are drawn.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have an open operation at this time," said kindergarten director Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten, where she says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o'clock, close the windows and have blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
“But it doesn’t help much,” she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees on our property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut tree, there is a table under it, and we do various things there," said kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to go with the children to the forest, where there is a greater coolness.
Children have wet hats and various games with water on the program.
"We have a hand pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children," Kompanova said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the director of a kindergarten in Novoborská street in Prague, said that the teachers are trying to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 pm.
Every child should have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have water bottles in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack of fresh fruits and vegetables, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Maybe today one mom brought around a ten-kilogram watermelon for children," Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger area.
The high temperatures have not yet seriously damaged the tram tracks.
A small damage occurred in the loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks at their disposal.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and depots," Řehková said.
In depots and at some alternating points, employees have so-called sodabars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ionic drinks.
"They can also take advantage of the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," she added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic disposed of 108 of them, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during a day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly employed in the fight with fire.
"Fires in the natural environment prevail and also those associated with harvest work," spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said.
The evening weather did not bring relief to the firefighters either, when storms and torrential rainfall replaced the heat in a number of places.
In the aftermath of the storms, firefighters took 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They were the ones who intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
However, firefighters were also needed in Stvolínky, Českolipsko, where 60 people were evacuated to safety from a children's camp due to a storm.
Tropical temperatures also added to the work of Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances went to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning with karo.
People should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to cut media diet
Many have tried before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff is planning to cut the flow of information from President Trump, including news reports, in hopes of keeping him afloat.
Here's a piece of Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key issue for the Trump White House that he intends to fix: misinformation that gets into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that he must personally approve all information - whether on paper or verbally - because the president can make better decisions based on the right information."
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have broken their teeth at Trump’s scrutiny and media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by the honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that there were a lot of other media that were easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - in the words of at least six former campaign organisers - is to ensure that Trump is regularly followed by media outlets that praise him."
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don’t, that Trump’s tweets would have been more outrageous if they hadn’t been checked.
Tweets that Trump never sent will most likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him at bay at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But so far, no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from instigating controversial topics.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by pushing Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the inclination of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump administration officials say the president often reacts very angry with negative media reports, especially leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - that accused Assistant Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of many leaks" from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was banned from Twitter forever for harassment; or that he didn’t substantiate his claims with any evidence; or that he had already made false allegations in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher said then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter were “trying to implement a system to manage and document the information that President Trump receives.”
Would that work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is pursuing the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsivity is not going away, and his aides are still vying for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate a moat and return to the 'Millionaire's Quarter'
Several of the most wealthy homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again in contention with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities over the right to reclaim the field behind their mansions.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a flourishing street in the city of Solihull, nicknamed the 'millionaire's quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. Not even the ditch, which was dug on the site by order of the authorities to prevent their incursion.
Tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served for the road.
The angry residents of the borough attacked Solihull's board of directors, saying they were 'unable to solve the problem'.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “They took the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board should be ashamed of its failure to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
More arrived last night, and there will probably be more today.'
She added: “Birmingham’s Board of Trustees knows how to deal with this problem, using court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and I'm not going to pay any more taxes until the board deals with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous, we just watched the last tourists leave and now they’re back.
And this time there are more, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
A spokesman for the Solihull City Council said: ‘We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are taking the necessary legal steps in cooperation with local police to successfully resolve the issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or illegal behavior to the police at 101.
This will give us the overall picture that we will present in court.'
Her husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
The government special delivered the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under the constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight was uncomplicated.
According to TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier this summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of Bratislava’s hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians step up fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving off the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
“Unless the NGO signs new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, greatly easing illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which has been in operation for the first year, declined to comment on the case because of accusations from Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, saving lives is and always will be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on all current allegations after collecting all the information and assessing the situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa ship of the Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board the ship, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the prosecutor's file, reportedly only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS, and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent a "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF), a Nobel Prize-winning organization, has also rejected the new code of conduct.
Minniti said the sharp decline in migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with Libya’s mayors on economic development initiatives, as well as with representatives from Chad, Niger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite crawled out of her overalls!
Hot summer days are absolutely tempting to wear only the most necessary that covers the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone who has to do with TV Prima, her body shrouded in a mini jumpsuit.
And all it took was a few simple moves and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
He overdressed her as many times as he cut between the halves, moreover, he coughed her up so high that she had to constantly edit it.
The attention of the gentlemen and photographers present was certainly not in short supply.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages inciting Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusets was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father testified in court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left at large until the decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse, Carter stood in place while sentencing with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped together, her eyes facing the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
“She couldn’t accept her own responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse."
However, Carter’s attorney said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her actions".
The plaintiff read out a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There won't be a single day that I don't grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain we will carry with us forever."
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "persecuted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
“The loss of the person I have been seeing since I was born is a pain I will carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in force that would penalize a person aiding in another person's suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car seat, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published inciting suicide.
“Hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don’t care,” Carter said in a text message sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do it Conrad" and "Just turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz stated that Carter craved attention through Roy's death and ordered that she refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW said the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is the seat of BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Tuesday it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with the Carbon Dioxide Ordinance.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of installing equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it more difficult for cars to be competitive.
While German carmakers face meticulous inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in order to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced emissions during testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is not eligible for extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system designed to circumvent European emission limits, widening the charges that Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de Sao Joao in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told the SIC Noticias television channel that the plane was flying close to people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach are said to have fled the danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
Two people were on board the plane, both of whom escaped the accident alive and were taken by police for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it began to be built as early as 1978.
Even though it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec Králové.
The construction of another section of it was stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We Eastern Czechs get the highway bit by bit, like when we cut salami.
A circle is cut off and then we will see when and if we get another one at all.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce driving time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the cities of Jaromír or Náchod, which is not a reasonable way to go.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a thing since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové and other sections to Jaromír began to be built recently, with the construction will begin at the end of this year, you could hear loud banging of earplugs in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that it will not be built this year.
Maybe not even next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has undergone a break-up.
Children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
They shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Hradec Králové City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
In the meantime, we leave D11 near the village with the eloquent name of Pohrabáčka.
So we go down, we just go along the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to subsequently join the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What do the children of the earth want?
What are the problems of the construction of roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically inconclusive in the current system?
Read the new reflection.
Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the south-east of France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the dry climate and harmful insects, which is causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “Lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
Cicadas and micro-bacteria-carrying locusts, which thrive in dry climates, are also to blame.”
The stakes are high.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil made from it is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution may be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist underscores growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa area, with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and ongoing drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, they meet mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foreboding.
Picking them out of what - drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job is to cover up criminal behavior.
Violence is continuing, and bodies are piling up across the country; journalists are on the rise: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there are at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His loss is felt, although his presence is all-pervading - a large photo of Valdez, with his middle finger on it, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and a Panama cap.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, the Committee to Protect Journalists has so far sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, making it very rare for journalists to go to court.
Riodoce journalists insist on reporting on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is now very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
“It’s foolish to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce's headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to get away a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently due to the title of the article - which can be translated as Twelfth River.
The gunmen then boarded his car and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In the case of Valdez, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with ornate two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “ceasefire” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoc, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on Joaquín Guzmán's sons.
Reconciliation could have angered the sons; the suspected gang members bought up all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in Mexico's fight against journalists.
He survived for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that would never change.
He was practically a veteran in Noroeste when he decided to sell $50 worth of stock in 2003 and set up Riodoc with his five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful reporting; newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish texts uncensored - readers were fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its coverage of Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his valiant reporting on Mexico's drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was afraid for my life,” he said at the award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a “way of life,” Valdez told Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What were you doing in the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
To the employees of Riodoc, Valdez is missed. The man was known for his joking and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you get involved with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing sites.”
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something is wrong, keep your hands off.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, “smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the Javier thing happened.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoca employees meet, because a few days ago, spyware was discovered that was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief in front of a forty-degree heat wave in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Journalists are making fun of whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who the government says are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last ventured into mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week’s agenda.
The first is the murder of former boxer Julio César Chávez's brother in Sinaloa.
They are also responsible for suspicious government spending in the governor’s hometown.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings at one of Culiacán’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block away from the state’s attorney’s office.
Officially, no one reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were wary as they prepared to write about what every resident of the city knew: that the restaurant was a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controlled all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped the army intervention unit.
Until a month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information about the abductions.
“Valdez would have cracked the case,” said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed “El Flaco” for his slender figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office was turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the staff certainly did not expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out the following morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoacán State.
Only a charred body has been discovered, and authorities say it's Adame, based on DNA analysis.
Journalist activity is escalating across the country, with many organizing protests and scribbling on sidewalks and SOS press buildings.
The newspaper's director, Bojorquez, is on a day-to-day visit to Washington, where he is seeking international support and seeking justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Sinaloa governor the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
Meanwhile, she applied to be transferred to another department out of concern that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “surrounded” by organized crime, corrupt officials, and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police officers and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
“You’re going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez said.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the severed head lay the keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to cease operations, such as the newspaper El Norte, based on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breachová.
The others are still going on, just as they did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels in a front-page article titled “What Do You Want from Us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a tough decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being chased.
And journalists are being harassed and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's midnight Friday night, and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - sipping a beer when the phone starts ringing.
They learned that 19 people were killed in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in Mazatlán.
War is escalating, just as many of the messages left by syndicate members in the region have promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not a day goes by and the title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez glances at the police patrol to see if they are paying attention.
If they are afraid, they don’t show it.
Beneath a huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloa - all Riodoc's employees follow in his footsteps.
“How could we think of leaving,” said Bojorquez, “when an intern asked me to take her to the streets the same day Javier was killed?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have called the 'Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved at such a high rate that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin, stating that the dinosaur had a 'problem past'.
According to an article in the journal Current Biology, it is “the best-preserved armored dinosaur found to date and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved state literally shocked the researchers, who described him in the words ‘remarkable indeed.’
According to National Geographic, the armored beehive is the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon what looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on uncovering an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
Once the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
‘You just close your eyes a little and you’ll believe he’s asleep,’ said Caleb Brown, head of work and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was very likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used the camouflage system used by many of today's animals.
Experts say that this allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110-million-year-old dinosaur of the family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who along with the team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They discovered a method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that the dinosaur was so numerous that evolution chose camouflage over confrontation to survive.
Many of today's camouflaged animals - such as deer, zebra and armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survival.
“The sale of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by Cretaceous-era predators,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown in color.
The researchers continue to study the animal and search for other knowledge about its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
Alberta had the same climate as Florida at the time, and its rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than they do today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it’s completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin while being preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as in the Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just turn a blind eye and it seems like he’s just sleeping.”
In the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt's body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from snout to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spines protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are preserved to such an extent that the armor plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “Finding such a person can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are preserved to such an extent that the armor plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
By his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist get the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and scrolled through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
“Police have just shot and killed an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street,” it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
TheePharoah was constantly retweeting her wall posts.
A rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying limply in the street, from where no one had taken him even after four hours.
“That’s crazy,” Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her and her family.
She put down her phone to return to him in the evening as she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign that read, "Ferguson Police Killed My Unarmed Son!"
She watched the live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun with which he aimed at the crowd and shouted, “I’m going to kill you all... animals.”
“That’s not normal,” Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’re used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
“I was angry and crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and resistance, of strength and resilience told from the perspective of people living in the community taking to the streets and demanding answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell established a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - on a topic they had discussed many times before - "about experiences with blacks".
“Remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?”
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that’s not right.”
"There was no way I was going to take her with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination of... what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also in knowing the difference between the different layers of black experience and what we need to do to be free.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism firsthand, she is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was on the South Florissant Road across from the police department, which became a base of activists awaiting police officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped to distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell’s eyes, a new type of activism slowly began to emerge.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and sought to introduce health care and food to black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the documentary's later co-director, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and his cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story to use?”
This type of skepticism permeated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to capitalize on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an interview: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected and we wanted to change that.”
Folayano has already partnered with co-director Damon Davis, a respected local artist who deals with the topic of death row inmates.
His participation in the project also involved Ferrell and six other local residents, who were watched by the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's assassination.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but it’s our testimony,” Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the goal of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together," Folayano said - it turned out she was the most open to participating in the filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face when she saw the final version of the documentary.
“But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created the #BlackLivesMatter campaign in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media - call themselves weirdos.
“Black outlandish women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the brunt of these events."
Folayane agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that “this is not a mere affirmative action” and Ferrell is not the main character of the documentary because of her views.
“It was the driving force and the source of energy,” she said.
“It’s no coincidence that she’s on the front lines, because life at these intersections is dangerous in the skin of a black weirdo woman.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, TV station cameras have cleared their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving two-and-a-half years for blocking a highway during demonstrations.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as "a mess."
Yet she continues to make the commitment she’s made since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains.”
There was a fire in the cologne.
Dozens of firefighters went to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Near Český Brod in the Kolín region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., firefighters declared a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighters spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, the helicopter also helped to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to put out the fire, causing damage for 700000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine harvester.
Hasit was also assisted by a helicopter that carried out six water drops in total.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 a.m. he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and dark - suspended from the ceiling on wires. Each of them seems to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples to Fort Leavenworth, where she is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally posting classified cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before his departure from the US presidency.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning’s DNA, and by using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on the pliability of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken of herself as a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six espionage laws, computer fraud, and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison officials, and only one lower-quality black-and-white photo was released, in which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum-blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg’s 2012 Stranger Visions project continued to respond positively.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
It was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg said in a statement.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic strip called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the show in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for Manning’s release a few days after the comic was published, which was a welcome change after several excruciating years in a Kansas military prison.
Interestingly, the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people who seek to expose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite resentment with his tweets in areas he should be supporting.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the artist’s statement on one of the gallery’s walls, Manning’s huge signature (the letter “i” in the surname is dotted with the heart) calls for an end to “self-acting factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture.”
On the opposite side there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
“I hope that people will learn from this that our genome doesn’t matter who we are and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
“DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the aforementioned graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging as King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in her hand.
“As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win,” she says.
“Never be silenced.”
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - as predicted in the comics - but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic effigies, lined up like a mob of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maninga on which her genetic haplogroups are written in pencil.
“In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to radiate a sense of crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates her.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staffer who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court file.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died of multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body was found on July 27.
Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau has been pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an email that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university's campuses.
“The relevant authorities are now investigating the matter and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's head of public relations, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the appropriate authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment no. 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathe and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future, we will complete the plan of WADA" - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
“Currently, part of the criteria of the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already been granted planning and testing rights in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future."
However, one of the criteria calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren about the government’s alleged sponsorship of doping by Russian athletes.
On the subject, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and so we can’t confess to something that never existed.”
Mutko was confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia’s RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: “We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected Russia of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization authorized planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "on the right track" to renew.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting fire to a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in the Frýdek-Místek region on Wednesday.
One of the accused is a minor, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the offence of general endangerment.
Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told journalists today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"This is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive for the whole matter," said Kužel.
He said police would discuss possible arrests of the accused.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigation service and the prosecutor who oversees the case are really working on the matter," said Kužel.
The wooden church of the Body of Christ in Guty dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, material damage will amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church was considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, other costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by fire 15 years ago.
This was caused by an electrical failure.
An exact copy was made in its place.
The state counts on the citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations that can be used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, it counts on the substantive intention of the Act on the Preparedness of Citizens to Defend the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which was tasked with processing it by the government, expects it to increase the physical fitness of Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
This is according to a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the military.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of conscription and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would get data on people who are willing to come to the country for help in times of crisis, and on their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would help the associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It is also planned to organize discussions with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One of the possible options assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the declaration of a state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," it said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the project is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of people, to protect themselves or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to perform tasks through improper behavior," the project states.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees the need to expand the scope of regional military headquarters, which would together employ another 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said the law should also help resolve some Czech politicians' disagreement with the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she didn’t find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even deceptive.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their disbelief in the entire process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from outside.
New human resources startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said she has gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel over the past three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a quick overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of the managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on the correction.
Companies are starting to realize the need to heed the culture of the workplace - in case they become the next Uber - that is being swept up in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and the harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to technical and financial progress website Let’s Talk Payments, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year, just ahead of the Uber scandals.
Nearly 600 of Convercent’s clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has also recently taken over.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
“The court of public opinion has empowered regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and regulators do not intervene - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion, or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
Employing more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, the Ruby Tuesday restaurant network has been using Convercent for more than a year to increase employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate executives.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail to the company management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a discouraging and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, general counsel of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there had not previously been a reliable way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, quick detection and resolution of issues that have never before been found by office managers is a long way from the actual resolution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It comes close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuits by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after the collapse of Enron over the abuse of employee ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “social media shined a light on the whole thing” that companies began to realize that they couldn’t simply hide their skeletons in a closet in the online world.
“Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It’s a business model and an opportunity endorsed by bold equity investors backed by both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, eventually taking home $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high salaries and interesting projects.
Employees want to feel that they are being accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“When people are happy at work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if the company is doing well and the company is thriving if its employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no wonder that there are plenty of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can provoke disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too heavily on data alone.
“Because when you don’t get things done, employees start asking, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
If not, why should I care?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts employee surveys on a monthly basis, can fix the problem within a day, Errett said.
After collecting feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and initiate communication training to successfully resolve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in an industry known for its frequent layoffs.
“If you don’t strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday was the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice na Hodonínsko.
Tuesday was the warmest day of the year at 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, there were not many heat records.
The heat mainly hit Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were surpassed or evened for 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was set by only nine long-term measurement stations.
Today’s temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, the current 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Strážnice, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures have occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice was the biggest heat in Dyákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but she did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, today’s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures began to rise there later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to CHMI, the current heatwaves in the Czech Republic will gradually fade away and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
However, high temperatures will remain in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
There's been a lot of trouble here.
Billionaires don’t get the same vote as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as impudent as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors the Robejšek Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta bought the Private Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andrej Babiš’s project was inadvertently named by the mayor of Kromříž, Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
Mayors have also recently caught up with their billionaires.
It is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the Jablotron security equipment company.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Enterée in the mayor's jersey, however, did not go well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the ANO movement to win 20 percent of the vote.
He smiled.
Grandpa's sneeze, however, is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for votes in the mayors' jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
My grandfather supported my grandfather in the last parliamentary elections.
"Grandma is not a seasoned orator and does not wield the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 election.
However, he does not go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
My grandfather will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world under his control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said that he wanted the mayors to learn to imagine a possible cooperation with Babis.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his views and stands up for himself, no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babis is sending someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his B.
Others may ask if the head of Jablotron has broken up with the head of Agrofert, perhaps, in a bad way in the store and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
His first public appearances, however, were not just about his grandmother.
He promised to send 10 million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to put up with such a statement.
After all, the court-appointed thug Zdeněk Bakala threw millions at all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárty, TOP 09 and the Citizen Democrats together made almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
When he entered politics, he could at least learn the rules of the game.
You may wonder why politics has such a bad reputation.
Dědek then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax benefits for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to us for about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a base of less than 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in conditions here.
The one with twenty poor.
In Dědek’s vision of society, the poor pay their taxes fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of running a welfare state that they don’t take much part in.
In short, the rich must be helped not to suffer poverty and want.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babis can rub his hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not nice people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For those of you who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not consider their party members or citizens of the state as their employees and their country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be discounted by 234 million.
Selling property is sometimes not easy.
And often it does not help 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by the President of the United States Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an astounding 8 million pounds.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The pamphlet says of the property, "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the US president did not justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to reduce the cost of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was ?21.5 million, the final price dropped to ?13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The impressive 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees on the land.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at $13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two training sessions a day. For the Bruins, long days are coming
As the 11th morning approaches, UCLA football players are squeezing at the sidelines of a new school field.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of doing nothing take a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester go to their rooms after a three-hour training session to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place the following morning at 6:30 a.m.
“These guys are going to be really busy for the next three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said in a statement.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 7:15 pm - to fit into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins start training camp a week earlier than last year, and training sessions are limited for the summer semester, with the decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day.
A total of 18 practice sessions are scheduled until August 20, following which formal preparations begin for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
Mora has said he supports the NCAA's decision, despite adding another entry to an already-charged players' diary.
“For three or four days, players are under a lot of stress and it’s very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But nobody gave up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed at the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of the surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center Hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the safety net behind the goal post.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security guards, as well as parking lot No. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I hope everything goes well.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans more fact-checking to cut down on fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties for review and display the findings below the original posts in an effort to combat so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially show the results of the survey below the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed messages influenced last year’s election for President of the United States.
Political debate is raging in Europe, with French voters avalanche of fake news about May’s presidential election, and Germany planning to fine the social media network ahead of the September election if it does not quickly remove angry posts.
Facebook said in a statement Thursday that it is preparing to launch testing of a new fake news-checking feature in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and make the right decisions about what they can share,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product manager of news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle played the lead role in the music video for the band Squeeze, and Margaret Thatcher also took refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in Kent, UK, inspiring the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his penchant for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“Looking at the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novella A Castle in England documents the lives of families who resided in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages until the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first of Rhodes's archive-inspired books: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I've gone back in time.
I love the archives!
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of spending almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on a wall and bottles that had been dumped in a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the grounds and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and wrote.
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, employees were only beginning to break into the archives, which Rhodes described as “aristocratics for many centuries throwing their hands around saying, ‘Bring it to the attic.’”
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting estates: "You may think the land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story titled The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a rebellion in a castle in 1380, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area, and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they’re somehow related.”
Other stories are firmly connected with the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was not discovered until several years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes’s favorite family is the Darrells: “I was intrigued by the male race - the men of that time were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have dealt with this by marrying rich or old wives - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to spin the heads of their heiresses."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week retreat in the Finnish wilderness, where he took inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was consumed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I was like, ‘Now get the hell back to real life.’
Washington to change green card rules
The media published President Donald Trump's words about the new US immigration plan, which will also include a change in the issuance of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will reduce the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who abound in funding and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it looked like 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots appears on the Internet.
Yeah.
Sex robots are very popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to 10 years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
“People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sex toys are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "edit" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would embarrass even Stepford's mistress.
Modern inflatable dolls have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his surrogate woman, including shyness.
And then there’s True Companion’s sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including “Frigid Farrah,” who features a shy character, and “Wild Wendy” with an “adventure” character.
“The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” True Companion’s website says.
She likes what she likes and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not to be confused with real human relationships. Disturbing are rather inferior female character traits and violent allusions - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
On its website, True Companion likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have a Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift away from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for captivating sex at an optional premium.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robot woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain marginalized by the general public.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by today's modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are winning their rights and a president is sitting in the White House, often very derogatory about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - hanging bodies and hollowed out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid’s Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (albeit with porn actresses’ measurements).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to the touch and look at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot can’t replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job or history, nothing to encourage their independence or undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
In the 21st century, the maid.
An NBA star on a green field.
Curry's fighting for the cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a botched first batting, did not get lost in the premiere start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player award winner played the first round at the Ellie Mae Classic of the lower series of the Web.com Tour in Hayward, California, at 74 strokes and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously, and his first shot ended up in a cup holder in a golf cart parked by a fairway.
Even after he was not as accurate between holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots above par.
"It wasn't an ideal way to start, you have to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it was a bit of a saddle," Curry said.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot at the tournament, but it was everything I had hoped for.
“If you told me I’d play 74 in the first round, I’d take it right away.”
If Curry can fight his way through a cut that is likely to be two under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the fright, I think I can," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and pros.
At Hayward, he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He was granted a sponsorship waiver to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense.
Political divisions that divide American voters and tear up entire families on a micro-scale are becoming the unmistakable hallmarks of the Trump era.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving seasons, the American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with the relatives who voted for Trump.
All we're supposed to do is wait for him to let go of our nerves.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to cement the family.
I’m talking about this because this week in New York I was visited by my cousin, a poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has long been a Republican idiot in our family.
She reminded me that being united in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom she’s been bickering over politics for years - is on the same page.
Having dinner at the family table is a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his antics may one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, defying his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rationality.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very slight offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We took my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel run by the New York City Parks Department - you won't find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filming and staring at their own shoulders in horror - a completely bleak look and jingling music strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés soon get tired of: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama looks back, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub - but a tube station in London.
The carousel in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point that it entertains two two-year-olds as well as two mature women.
If I could rate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience in the store this week when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street it is the same, except that I can add 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does this slow down otherwise rapid sales, but the waitress is thus forced to intrude into shoppers’ favor when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile as I reluctantly rated my credit card handover five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to the hospital.
He was treated last year for cuts to his wrist that the prison said he had caused himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed his girlfriend, Steenkamp, in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a bathroom closet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could be sentenced to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda gave birth to a baby panda mating in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of captive pandas.
Zhang Zhong told the New China Agency that there is a high risk of interbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to mate captured pandas with wild pandas is the first step to helping protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao-cao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to a tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met Cao Cao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and turned out successfully.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males misjudge the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement said.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping and imposed severe penalties on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open.
The course at Kingsbarns, Scotland, was bypassed with a score of one under par when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player thus has the hope that she will pass the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the competition with a grant of $ 3.25 million came out best to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a course record of 64 strokes, i.e. eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry houses due to the incident.
The Netherlands’ food safety watchdog NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, meaning 80 percent of the eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of types of eggs identifiable by specific numbers present a risk.
According to German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech PMC, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also proceeded to close the farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, the veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating from Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problematic brands of insecticide have appeared.
The last time eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market was in April, and the last time eggs from the Netherlands were on the Czech market was in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last seen in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is used in flea, tick and everything products.
However, it should not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss him, says goalie Sedláček and he is looking for an engagement.
I want to catch 10 more years.
"Maybe one day I'll come back," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you lived in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as a school, it would be three.
The first year I didn’t have much to catch, I had an experienced goalie in front of me.
I was studying.
The second year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie that I was switching with again.
Last year, I always thought I would.
But in the first ten games we only got maybe five points, so the coaches started to shoot it.
At the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're in our third year together, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How tough is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The top 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan that have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play into the void.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There is more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Have you had trouble traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s no problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually made so that you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do you see your club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
They're all cheering.
Even when things weren’t going well, there were a lot of people.
Did Dinamo’s appearance in the KHL help Latvia almost make it to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time their results at the World Championships began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they lost in the quarter-finals to Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they have taken it to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts is in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is before signing the contract.
Why do so many come here?
They're not B-players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
At the beginning of February I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they decided on someone else in the final.
So I’m training at home in Zlín and I’ll wait for something to come up.
You're not nervous about it?
That was four years ago, when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, but I am home after some time.
I got something in the KHL, so I'll take it another way.
The question is when and where to sign.
How realistic is the variant that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We’ll see what happens in a month or so.
All I can do now is wait and see what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season was not so good as to be able to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote an article about the camp in Lety near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the key passages of the article.
The camp at Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it is probably best to take a look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument Remembrance site Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they will learn that the camp stood two kilometres east of the village of Lety, that it served as a labour camp from 8 August 1940, that it was a collection camp from 1 January 1942, and that it became a gypsy camp from 2 August 1942.
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On 4 May 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp transported 370 people.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings caused by human beings and perverse ideology.
There is no question that these events need to be constantly recalled.
There is also no doubt that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a memorial was unveiled at Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pig farm, but so far this has not happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 it has been administered under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pig farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "some figures exist, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it will not be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is clearly not a threat, I think it would be a waste of money anyway.
Does the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of remembrance, is practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants to can bow down to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's leave it as it is, and let's keep the reverent place with the utmost care.
The entrusted property, including taxpayers’ money, should be handled by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with due diligence.
At least in my own company!
Of course, the finance minister and the deputy prime minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the perspective of the above facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
I went to see the place in May this year.
Very decent driveway, well-groomed parking, replicas of wooden camp buildings.
In one exposition, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own reverent site, which is made of stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes appropriate to the meaning of this place, as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be wise to consider, for example, whether it would be possible to preserve some of the exposed foundations and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
The Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could be working in this direction.
If he manages to get the government to buy the pig farm for state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic position as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate may alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the U.K. causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps build immune cells that promote gut resistance.
The study’s lead author, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body’s tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have found a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common component of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that promote tolerance in the body.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diets, the more these immune cells they had."
He also suggested that if it turns out to be the same for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory gut environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in the study of a type of immune cells promoting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately lacked the cells.
She deduced that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice’s intestines were tested using DNA sorting, and researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
The mice, which were kept in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome - they did not develop this kind of immune cells - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and they formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers bred L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - free of the bacterium - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After halved the doses of tryptophan at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “We should all probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing Nemanja Matic to Manchester United 'genius'
Manchester United have added Nemanja Matic to their squad - at least Jose Mourinho thinks so after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Matic, who signed a 40-million-pound contract, made his debut in the first game with a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and made an appearance in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic was out of shape and played only 45 minutes, which, in Mourinho's words, needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he’s experienced, he’s intelligent, and he’s got genius thinking, he’s thinking football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get into shape as soon as possible.”
Like Matic, Mourinho's new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players,” he added.
“Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit they did their best for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken cuticles Ladi Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The many-promising picture began to take shape thanks to a new show on TV Prima’s Zdeněk Academy.
The snake took a chance right away.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on social media.
And because the two of them have been tipping for several years, Láďa did not forget to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo with diet chicken, American cucumbers, or I can ask you out and show you why fried cheese is popular," he said.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It’s time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what about the boss?" said Lightning.
Pohlreich did not comment, however, because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss!.
The participation of Pear in the Culinary Academy was responded only by Prima, who took the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
He dealt a big blow to Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
In just a few days, more than 300,000 copies were sold!
The new show presented yesterday by Prima at the press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from among the audience and in twelve works he introduces them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014, Zdeněk had his t-shirt ironed with a crossed-out pear.
If he had my face in there, I'd be laughing a lot.
"I'll just smile over the pear - pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Láďa said.
He thinks about Láďa’s culinary art.
"Cooking according to Ládi Hruška is not an option at home either, because I am not going to let gastropunk in my house," he said.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, he even says that I make chicken with honey.
But his recipes will certainly not appear in my show," Hrušek said.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or idiot," Pohlreich said of Hruška at a lecture.
"I'm not twenty years old to wave my hand at them, but I don't deal with them as much," Hruška said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, 33, has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives using the technology.
The procedure for implantation and treatment is overseen by Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers the service of replacing door locks and microchip compatible cars. The price of one lock is 300 EUR.
The married father of one child has had the technology integrated into his home and into his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House Props Cost Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month cost $24,000, according to Navy records released by TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed a showcase of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a fork-lift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records said.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such an important event," HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and will remain in place until complete clearance of the entire site, which was planned between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail further stated that if there was a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to working hours regulations.
The original crew remained at the scene that evening, along with a helicopter and a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by TIME - it was not clear whether a second crew was sent in the end.
The Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this regulation.
"We wondered if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’ve been blocked,” the deputy commander wrote.
This “Made in America” show was labeled an official event by the White House, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political overtones.
While attending the event, the president pushed for health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep government regulations in check.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence for purely presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after a presidential plane was flying in the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the Made in America showcase, which showcases products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and on South Lawn and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew's current training, a state official said.
The helicopter unit flew for another 11 hours on the same day as part of a “non-presidential support mission.”
The White House said no additional taxpayer money was being paid for.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not in any way involved in negotiations to expose the helicopter to South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, the Navy said.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for the 2017 fiscal year, the reimbursement of DoD expenses for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below the stated amount.
"It's very misleading to quote taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement," Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursements do not include personnel costs, but include fuel price, maintenance, and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, advocated the use of the helicopter for parade purposes.
“The idea for this week’s show is to showcase products made in the U.S.,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and that they are providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in making.
This is a fact to be recalled.”
It is not clear whether Trump, on his tour of South Lawn, was also looking at the helicopter. The only thing that can be said for sure is that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I own three myself.”
A young woman was trapped in a swamp by Macha Lake, the police wading towards her.
The girl went to the beach around 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the marshes.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help with her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent battery.
"For this reason, police officers soon lost contact with her," police spokesperson Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols went to the place she described, but it was not easy to find a young woman.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through reed marshes for hundreds of meters before they could feel the solid ground under their feet again," Baláková said.
She was also missing in the same way.
The officers were focused on the direction in which she was calling for help.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would be counting out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at a quarter to five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called her to the Český Lípa hospital.
A connection between the old man and the old man?
A wanted bride becomes a sold girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz, the billionaire basically tells voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
He also confirmed that a politically incoherent bunch of rather lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, have no national program for the House elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion she has.
Vít Bárta used to start like this, and it didn’t turn out very well.
In addition, Dědek’s hunt for decent people and personalities who will eventually replace some of the mayors on the candidates, as admitted by Gazdík, also invalidates the favorite argument of the head of the STAN that the greatest value of the movement are the politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians according to surveys.
They will now be able to replace the quickly collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík also explained the total break with the People's Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the People's Party's lists.
However, if STAN was suspected by only a few people at that time, after the arrival of Dědek, the game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long been opposed to ANO by Andrej Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, said: "My goal is that the ANO movement, the Mayors movement, will gain 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mistake the movement.
He is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is no accident.
He often talks about politics like Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has for some time been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek’s helping hand seems to make the desired bride even more of a sales girl.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party and now for a change he is looking for decent people.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police Dogs Trained in the Bridge by Helicopter
Explosive-detection dogs and search dogs practiced helicopter overflights at Lake Most today.
The police dog must not be fearful of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústí Region, Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge were trained both adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training.
In addition to the standard training, which was to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the lost figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter journey.
"He gets the helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tommy said.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately after a helicopter ride is dropped from training.
"They usually leave them in the garden, for example," Tommy added.
Police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Ústí Region.
German shepherds dominate, but the number of Belgian shepherds is also increasing.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is raising it himself, preparing it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tommy added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal any health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unafraid, he will pass the first exams at 20 months.
"He is about two and a half to three years into a sharp hit," Tommy added.
The length of service depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their handlers.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Pablo Escobar Is Out of the Game and Cali Cartel Is the Centerpiece of Netflix’s Hit Series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the murderer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has already received the third and fourth seasons - the first of which has already received the first trailer and hints of other negative characters.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” except that they escalate acts of violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pena, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, are present, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior UN mission official, said hundreds of women were running for local council elections, three women were running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters were women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate, as well as all related processes related to the election.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on April 5.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process, which has turned international combat activity into a back-and-forth.
For the first time ever in this year’s election, a democratically elected government is peacefully handing over power to a successor government.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen democracy in Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
To a good beer in a reborn brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobeč near Mšena back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, which was mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted to steam engine operation in the nineteenth century.
Years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
During the Second World War production was unfortunately stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled for building material.
In 2007, however, a new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouza.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same appearance as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded with the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing was revived.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque countryside of Kokořínsko, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use kokořínských water springing in the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobeč fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you can taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and half past one.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type worldwide?
This unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a large underground.
Here should be the headquarters, barracks, stores of ammunition, material, power plant, engine room and hospital.
The construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, only one massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken down.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also visit here.
The underground is now 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with an exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed light fortification, two infantry cabins under construction, trenches and an educational trail in the Fortified Trutnov region.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan’s Port of Rome, and the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
Monastery Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged building of the convent above a beautiful garden.
Unfortunately, this list belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of disappearing.
Enthusiasts, however, do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas, among others, will perform, you will see fencing performances and look at the places of the beautiful large building, which are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look Neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to Neanderthals in the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Museum in Brno invites you to an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistoric period, the Stone Age, to the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals were able to cope in a perfect way with various extreme climatic conditions, especially with the alternation of the ice and interglacial periods.
Despite their simple material culture, they were hugely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting skills were, but also their aesthetic sensibilities.
You wouldn't say that to Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth festival KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday the fifth in Veveří Castle.

Chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy musical and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theater, bouncy castle, Smurfs competition path and of course a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with herbarium creation and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application Pl?ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they have just come across for a walk, this app will advise them.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant, and the app will recognize what kind of plant it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava’s Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who together with teachers photographed the application and added plants from their surroundings.
The new French app is available for free download at The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of French programmers was to get as many people as possible to contribute their images to the application, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who can hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a high-quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which it then assigns under the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a snapshot of a plant that does not yet appear in the database after creating an account in the app.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková said.
GMB concerns over investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Unions are demanding assurances from McVitie's executives about the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company has been silent for the time being about a possible investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, producing Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that it had invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area over the previous few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be "among the first informed" in the event of changes to the plant's operations.
In a letter to the company's construction manager, GMB's Scottish trade unions expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not get its promises of financing and upgrading production lines."
Drew Duffy, chief executive of GMB, said: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan at Tollcross is of great concern to our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social isolation.
In terms of work, pay and utility - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising cost of living and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
A spokesman for Pladis said: “Building manager Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We have talked to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, particularly in production lines and operational efficiencies.
We very much appreciate Tollcross’s heritage and location, and in the event of any changes to the plant’s operations, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to come to its side after depositing 189 million euros, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did the French team warn Barcelona of its record raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has stirred the waters of the summer transfers. The Ligue 1 club is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, which paid ?89 million for him last season.
Upon confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest-paid professional athlete, receiving more than $500,000 a week from PSG after tax.
Barcelona are outraged by the way Neymar has pulled out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world made aware of this fact three years ago by the President of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all the club that would be interested in taking over one of PSG's top players.
“I’m not afraid, because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we will certainly reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face consequences.”
Barcelona seem to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the Italian representative to leave under any circumstances. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its audacious negotiations with Neymar's departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have rules that are widely understood?
Donald Trump has called for anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
A day earlier, Trump had written that China was not doing anything about the North Korean threat and that it could not go on like this.
It also makes the idea of sanctions sound like straw from shoes.
These things can't be lumped together.
Indeed, Maduro’s Venezuela has set out on the path towards dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not doing what the US president wants.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even the average voter, American, European or otherwise, would understand what it lies in and what system of rules the policy of sanctions is based on, it would be a task almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only completes what President Obama has already prepared, he just gave it an implementation stamp.
Then why the commotion?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the U.S. election, he would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but tightened.
But Europe is even more scared.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
What, are kosher just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
There are no kosher or anti-Russian sanctions.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has complained that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Do you think that sanctions should be applied only so weak that they do not threaten anyone?
The ordinary voter falters.
For three years, he was told that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now clear that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter nodded and more broadly.
Sanctions are coming on Russia for mounting too much where it shouldn’t.
China is being bullied for being too small.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just reflections have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, an order, or rules in this?
Andrej Babiš: I am not thinking about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crosses the Czech Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubický Region, it also has all the candidates ready.
In his words, he did not interfere with them.
He even agreed to let the Moravian-Silesian Governor and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrák lead.
"If he succeeds, however, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or a governor," Babis confirmed his earlier position.
You have annoyed many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors should manage municipalities and towns alone, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I am convinced that we should elect mayors as well.
In my book, I'm not talking about disturbing the representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When I was presenting your book What I Dream About When I'm Sleeping, I heard firsthand that you were talking about abolishing councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about a direct election and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 councilors.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor reproaches herself for not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that has only been run by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
I'm not saying they did it well.
But the current Prime Minister is not in charge of anything, he is merely moderating the debate.
That can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
He'd be ideal, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to the one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a rolling mandate for ministers and a modification of the House Rules of Procedure to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to present themselves at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
That’s what your opponents are afraid of.
That, as a dictator, you will run the government, control the House with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors you will dominate the entire country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with talking about the number of members.
French President Macron announced the reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French per legislator, while in our country it costs 17,000 Czechs.
No one accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the elections by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no danger of that in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team in government that works for the people, not for their parties or their departments.
I do not understand why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will increase.
Why did they outvote me and add 21% to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you do that as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is supposed to intervene when ministers are behaving uneconomically, confusing the government with a travel agency and would like to do business with the money of the state like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers are not to argue in government, they are to settle disputes outside it.
There must be ready-made material in the cabinet, there is no room for coalition divisions, for power votes and for business to be decided there.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when the ministers are mainly partisan?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply and set Babiš out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
However, if she is a person and has control skills, she does not need such empty gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would nominate as finance minister?
I don’t think about it at all, because we probably won’t be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don’t know what I’ve done so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayors have acquired an entrepreneur, Dědek, who would like to work with you, and perhaps Jiří Čunek, a winger of yours, will win.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus, Jr., who may also assert himself in the ODS, will also not oppose it.
I would leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and ANO Vice-President Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura’s SPD, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamuras come to mind as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it that way.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he raised money from Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, he has a wide involvement of people in the management of the company, direct democracy, I can agree with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations with gallows and wants to leave the EU is acceptable to you?
We are not thinking about working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating the winner with the other, but God knows who's gonna be the winner and who's gonna be number two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the program of the coalition government.
Let's go back to your quest to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything be exterminated, never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was the reason why he fired me.
As soon as he did, he controlled the government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of ČEZ, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you were to become prime minister, would you change the staff on the Supervisory Board and replace CEZ’s senior management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not yet.
Rumor has it that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange even better with YES.
Maybe after the election everything will go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don’t have any lobbyist for Humble or Rose, I am a separate unit and I don’t deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to change the leadership of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like to see a transparent society.
So far, he has done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, he never managed it, he was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
To me, it's a trivial matter.
CEZ is supposed to take Dukovany, appreciate it, put it in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supplier competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear units is absurd.
What about Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I have no authority to fire anyone.
But mastering it is.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about $7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How do they not know?
After all, the Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of ČT and ČRo.
Look how the news is being discussed, for the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigation files and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push me out of the government, which contributed a percentage of TOP 09, but ČSSD took them down.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat to democracy Babis.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how Jaroslav Faltýnek, First Vice-Chairman of ANO, builds his power base by putting his son on the Supervisory Board of Teplárne Brno and arranges for a related lawyer Květoslav Hlína contracts with municipal and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or České dráhy?
We have a permanent dispute here.
I don’t like it, and I’ve blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
