Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States.
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a check for $1.4 million for outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House will fly to the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and he will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple is then scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive a prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to win the award, but only the third to win it in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is accepting the prize as the president who is currently at war in two countries.
He increased the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for 10 million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to give them for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
A busy program will then take the president and his wife to a banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, there will also be a prime minister and another 250 invited guests.
From the start, Obama has been very cautious about prices.
He said, for example, that he felt he did not deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that this is not just a prize for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was "a call to action".
Nature conservationist accused of extortion
The Litomerice Police have accused the chairman of the society of nature conservation Litoměrice of extortion.
In several cases over the past year, he referred to some construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for his benefit for the withdrawal of the appeal, police spokesperson Alena Romova said.
Lubomír Studnička is the chairman of the Litomyšl Society for Nature Conservation.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers don't smell good
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage packaging, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
Take a few minutes to find the right trash can.
I am not saying that there is no waste at all.
But it seems to me that, given that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only because we as citizens can still throw paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but especially the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle into a collection basket in the center?
It's hard work. It takes time and a lot of nerve.
The only place I have come across so far is on Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefená Husa.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it doesn't seem like much to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the waste sorting is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort waste.
Out of laziness.
They are far from garbage.
I don't blame them.
After the party, I offered to throw away a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored bins in sight on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the way to the shalina.
However, the waste has run out of it.
It’s still the center of Brno that represents the city the most, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and aesthetics may not be of much interest to the Brno socialists.
They would rather buy a hockey extra league that would embarrass us all over the country than buy a few more containers and offer to sort other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a while of browsing on the Internet with official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added money to farmers or officials despite the government’s view, there is no need for pensions, sickness or building savings in the budget.
But also on interest on the national debt or on international lawsuits.
It will add to the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for an increase in some groups, they relied on the government to borrow on sensitive expenditures, pensions or sick pay. "It is just a postponement of problems into the future, the laying of mines," says Janota.
Borrowed money is paid more and more and sometimes has to be returned.
There is not much choice of where to get it from the state.
If they do not reduce welfare benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To everyone to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sick pay, from which $1.8 billion has disappeared.
But at the cost of more debt, next year’s box office will not be short of $163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money to several groups of voters, there will also be a lack of $5 billion for the completion of highways and railways next year.
These are mostly already competing and unfinished sections, which can not be re-designed and possibly cheaper.
Canned, which is not free either.
This means a delay or stoppage of 30 large buildings, and the use of European money is also at risk, transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka warns.
ČSSD has proposed that the loss of money will be solved in Solomonian language - it will reach into the dividends of ČEZ, which the state owns for the most part, and from them it will add to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, let alone a bottomless source.
Last year, $18 billion came into the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, replenish the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
But the carnival does not end there.
Nearly $3 billion has been spent on various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, as well as litigation and even building savings.
Whether he can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota said.
The minister will then have to save money inside the ministry or, in the worst case, reach for the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the already started two billion-dollar project of the State Treasury, which is supposed to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities are spending for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister could not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped, sanctions would come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and you’ll be transferred from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
This is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will be working at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM running Windows Mobile and Android simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, VMware is working with European and US operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
The bare ski slopes do not only worry the Krkonoše skiers.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guest houses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains, you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of traffic to our site.
People go through offers, check prices, but so far they are afraid of binding orders.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be in the snow or on the mud," said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to their wishes should not hesitate with the order.
Who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Špindlerův Mlýn hotels offer mostly one-week stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to back off and go for a shorter period of time.
And then the available rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura guessed.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by the top travel agency Ingtours.
We are most interested in Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer remain vacant.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last minute cheaper Christmas stays,” Ingtours director Petr Schiefert said.
New Year's Eve in the Krkonoše Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabí travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
Good for the first two weeks of February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he attacks.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also be sold out,” says Schiefert.
On the other hand, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snezkou are better than last year.
We're about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have a few more places to go.
There is a lot of interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Prague.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also occupied by the Omnia Hotel at the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the latest Janské Lázně hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, which is already about 60% occupied.
February is a bit weaker so far, but as soon as it snows, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the greater part of the snow, hoteliers have to let go of the taste.
On Thursday, it is supposed to cool down, if there are any precipitation, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed.
Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical how schoolboyly Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the dumbest, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally sweated out his much-anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it through a copy machine from Bush’s Iraq script three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward".
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to civil war-torn Iraq as “irresponsible and ultimately catastrophic.”
But the months that followed showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only one that was so possible and so successful that there is no talk about Iraq in news programs today.
It did not improve Bush’s reputation, but it did objectively leave his successor with a far more grateful starting point than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again.
He was once again asked by field commanders to increase his military contingent, especially by the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the hesitant gunmen in the White House, despite his subordination habits.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not fall for anything better, so at least he cheated the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze the promise of another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he himself had originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in just 18 months, and to end the process in three years.
Many doubt that the half-hearted increase will give the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honoring the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their masters every day, are preparing poorly.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the lack of clarity of the circumstances, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an "actionable state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
Only a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality, can believe that soldiers sent into the turmoil for the purpose of "coming home soon" will cause a miracle here.
Politically, the date of the withdrawal is a sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will view it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is close to minus.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically interfering with the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will be faced with the difficult question of whether or not to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered just as Obama says America is about to pull out of Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mark a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only sticking point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election, so there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if this turns out to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
This was announced by the company, which thus responds to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
Shares can also be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has been criticized for setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The company’s total revenue for this year is expected to exceed $20 billion, despite the measures announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax bankers’ bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds at a one-time rate of 50 percent.
France is taking similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in every field except physics.
A record five women in Stockholm today received this year's Nobel Prizes in literature and professional categories from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to the four women scientists, there was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Muller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot, Jack Szostak, for research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize went to Ada Jonath, an Israeli, along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, which was awarded to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to Charles Kao for his research on optical fibers and George Smith and Willard Boyle for their invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis for all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of financial reward.
This amounts to 10 million Swedish kronor (about 25 million CZK) for each category.
If there is more than one of them, the reward is shared among them.
The most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to US President Barack Obama in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and also leads the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In his defense of his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to win peace, even if the cost is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janota, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and possibly Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He said the deficit was too high, further exacerbating the public finance crisis.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota plans to hold talks with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The House on Wednesday approved proposals by the left to move money and raised money for state employees' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government accused the Social Democrats of surreptitiously increasing the budget deficit.
A sharp internal political dispute arose between the left and the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, due to which a question mark begins to rise over the further operation of Fischer’s official cabinet, which was agreed upon by the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party in the spring.
Critics say the budget, as adopted by the House, is effectively destroying a package of austerity measures that the Fischer government pushed through in the autumn, which it says is intended to stop the country's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget bill, said at a debate breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting the “serious problem” of “unsustainable deficits” in public finances for a long time.
He says he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, could bring about an improvement.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was scary and the government should consider continuing to exist.
ODS vice-chairman Petr Nečas told the Czech News Agency that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements".
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year is frightening and will exceed CZK 200 billion.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandela is played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's new film.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated tells the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some criticisms that the main roles are played by American actors.
It tells the story of sport, race, and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless campaigner against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president Nelson Mandela is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in this.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed the leader of the abolition of slavery movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional U.S. president, and even a god in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation is still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players, who are globally among the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dine with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I squeeze your hand, I take your energy, it transfers, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays Francois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominate.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look so much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real role models under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: The Undefeated received positive reviews and there is talk of ambitions for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words, "It was a very good story, a very well done film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
Secrets of the glow over Norway deciphered: Russians tested the missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry has just admitted that it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, dubbed the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black plague for Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence during the tests of the rocket did not have a proper effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually did not fly at all or was damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers refer to the "Bulava" as "a rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
At first, the 13th attempt was normal.
At the end of the flight, the equipment was damaged again.
The engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from a vessel that is both in motion and submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava".
From the very beginning, the Norwegians had no doubt that this was a Russian missile.
This time the generals defend themselves and say that we can not speak unequivocally of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch was carried out without fail, only six of the thirteen were considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
That’s why the generals are optimistic that the “Bulava” will one day fly without problems and that it can even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear units with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signs one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again play in a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably start in Friday's KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljaš was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to sort out some formalities, Moscow club coach Sergey Němčinov said.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, said Němčinov.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe spent the entire season at Hartford, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships, and triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai Motor has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
Because of overtime, the unions went on strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, the union wants to agree on one more shift this Saturday.
We can’t resign from our production plan, which is crucial, which is why we proposed voluntary overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts, Vaněk said.
News server Sedmička.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 for employees who work Saturday shifts.
It will also be available on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vaněk, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated by the proposed overtime.
They can either pay an overtime supplement or they can choose an extra day off on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists and protest workers, who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for the month of December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the company’s employees were forced to work two hours overtime every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
Further negotiations between the company and the union are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the automaker escalated on Wednesday, when about 400 workers spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and alleged bullying.
The management countered that overtime had to be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
In their announcement of the strike on Monday, the trade unionists also demanded that they not be penalized by any sanctions on employees who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions are asking the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5000 crowns for it this year.
Hyundai Motor currently employs 2,000 people.
The company began mass production in November of last year.
By September, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even on 'hardy' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already acquired immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound does not act on the common variant of the virus as much as some already available drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured.
However, patients can significantly extend the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus proliferation results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the University of Chemistry and Technology Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal-carborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new ‘enhanced’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Traitorous and resilient virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV cleavage, no mature infectious viral particles would arise.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, researchers describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of agents against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications, make metal carborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Arguing over the budget. ODS went to Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrifying" and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called the comments strong.
He says he's taking the time to analyze.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of a civil service cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the Chamber to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed, Nečas pointed out.
The Chamber of Deputies adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House raised money for state employees' salaries, the operation of social services, and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s criticism of the Social Democrats’ proposals was that they were surreptitiously increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, fulfilling the government’s wish that the amended budget was less of a bad option than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and Vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would take stock of the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to leave office if the amendments had been adopted, the situation might have been different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment for the prime minister on Monday.
He said he is considering further tenure.
This is due to his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out in favour of further fighting the budget deficit, according to Nečas, the ČSSD nominees, who pushed through the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or an amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS are not guilty
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in positions of deputy to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of fighting the public deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the Chamber".
But he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it’s up to date, I’ll address it,” Defence Minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a meeting of the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday unless the Prime Minister specifically asked the Citizen Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS did not burden the absence of the party leader in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the bolshevization of the Chamber and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself responded.
Under the new ČD rules, there will be fewer trains for almost the same fare
As of December 13, České dráhy will cancel or reduce some less busy express trains and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more opportunities to connect to the capital, the railways will add one pendolino set to this track.
On the contrary, Rychlovlak will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also go on the line Praha - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
Of the regions, the railways are planning the biggest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové Region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
There are also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line is limited to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovicky must change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava with Pendolino as of December 13.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
Fast trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport. In total, the Ministry of Transport will pay CZK 4 billion to cover the so-called demonstrable loss next year, as it did this year. Localities will order regions, in total they will pay CZK 8 billion for them next year, with the state contributing almost CZK 3 billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For local stations and express trains, the railways have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, and therefore probably did not increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur for one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of the eLiška will be based on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippines arrests more than 50 children, frees children
Today, 75 people were kidnapped in the southern Philippines, including several elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants are said to be using the hostages as a living shield while fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the Associated Press, police initially pursued the kidnapper because of the violence, which involved settling scores between two local family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, over a recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governorship election were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
There are also Muslim separatists in Mindanao.
Peace talks resumed with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film, Invictus: The Undefeated, is coming to theaters in the United States, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, who Mandela himself was said to have chosen for his portrayal years ago.
The supporting male role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in cinemas arise from the feedback of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
He was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988 and the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk in 1993.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time, disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the black ruling majority are shaking the media.
The response to the new South African film has so far been overwhelmingly positive, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main characters being "sloppy" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to, as they say, draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s gala premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing that the film is a reminder of Mandela's personality and message.
This is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
Based on a book by British writer John Carlin entitled In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation, the film portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman thus tries to unite two racial and mutually exclusive groups of the population during the course of the film, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the world cup playing role in the South African national rugby jersey, which South Africa won at that time.
Entering the lawn in a jersey that is considered almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela received a large ovation from a predominantly white audience 14 years ago and gained recognition from the white population.
Football championships may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled the country to Britain, told LN in a recent interview.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burning in the Louny region
The fire was caught this morning by a transformer from the Čeps company in a substation near the village of Výškov in the Louny region.
Six units are involved in the fire, according to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the regional fire brigade in Ústí.
Originally, firefighters wanted the transformer to burn out, but later reconsidered and the fire extinguishes with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mandateová, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be calculated after the fire.
According to Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
Nothing like this has happened in the ten years of Čeps’ operation, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to ČEZ spokesperson Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, power supplies for North Bohemia were not interrupted, and the fire did not affect the functioning of households, authorities or companies.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, power lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 transformers transferring electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and line routes with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura files criminal complaint for defamation against three ČSSD governors
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today against three social democratic governors.
Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region, Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in 20 minutes of Radiožurnál.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, while we have brought an offer only for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true, because we know the prices of České dráhy, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is for defamation against the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be a continuation of Mr. Jančura’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of myself and my country, and I will call on other governors to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jančura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that he will invest several million crowns in advertising, which will warn about the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He told the radio station that he would suspend the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would be directed against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional rail links with České dráhy and did not tender for around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jančur was already threatened by a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we might lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who he is, I will not say his name, he told Radiožurnál Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal diseases from January will break down the usual habits.
It should be free and optional for families.
There have been calls for mandatory vaccinations to be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The FDA has already set maximum prices for the vaccines that health insurance companies will pay.
Experts are also very clear about the vaccination process.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August kids
Since January, children born on or after August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not received a single dose of vaccination.
Anyone who started the vaccine last year or earlier will have to pay for their own re-vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
My parents paid $1,600 for one or more doses.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccination benefits.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccinations would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year for all mass vaccinations of children.
The paid vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to research, 28 children under the age of 10 die from pneumococcal infections in our country within a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid vaccination of children against pneumococcal diseases in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
However, there are also concerns that the vaccine may be mandatory in the future.
It has been covered by insurance since January and is optional.
For example, Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civic association, suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference that our association attended were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been achieved.
I think that’s the path we need to take now, Kalovský said.
The Department of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccine.
We are not thinking about it at the moment, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Vaccines have disadvantages, say doctors
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of General Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the policy decision that the vaccination was initiated as voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in that it is the first mass vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatment, Cabrnoch said.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
But this is related to the concerns of general practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MPs were concerned that the insurance companies might be able to “take money out of health insurance”.
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
According to estimates, individual paediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It won’t be easy, Cabrnoch says.
Son of American artist 'stole in a museum'
Frank Frazetta's son was charged with attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
A named Mr. Frazetta and a second man used a excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81 years old, is famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta, Jr. may have been motivated to act by long-standing family feuds.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta, Jr. made an affidavit, aged 52, that he had done so at his father's direction, "to get into the museum in any possible way and move the paintings to the malting rooms", according to the agency.
Mr Frazetta Sr. has denied granting any such permission, the agency said.
Labour opposes planned tax hike
The ministers advocated increasing taxes and cutting spending, announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling put it, the Tories "missed" the opportunity to show they were serious about postponing deficit-reduction decisions until after the election.
The chancellor has also come under fire over the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and 1% adjustment of public payments from 2011.
Anger over Social Security
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they did not cause, warning of "problems" in advance.
Social insurance is increasing - growing at around ?3 trillion a year - which has outraged a community of entrepreneurs who have said it is an employment tax, while there should be a focus on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, limited to these revenues of more than 20000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PBR KEY POINTS
Social security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75% this year
A new tax on 50% of bankers' bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax on depreciation for small businesses
Tax cuts for electric vehicles and wind power plants
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the state financial administration's estimate, some incomes of 30000 pounds will decrease by 90 pounds per year, and some incomes of 40000 pounds will decrease by 190 pounds, while some incomes of 10,000 pounds will increase by 110 pounds.
The ministers announced their target of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should go to the 5% of those with the highest incomes.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increase and spending cuts were "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would need to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is an absolute basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he believed the economy should grow by the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth - which will affect the amount of borrowing required and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
He said the economic downturn this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% forecast in April - because loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity'
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" for Labour, have called the planned loan of 789 trillion pounds unbearable over the next six years.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid, adding, "cynically", to postpone this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that was feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts as opposed to proposals by Tories who would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to boost spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on sand."
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcement - such as the aforementioned inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - could lead to accusations against the chancellor in an election campaign if the money is difficult to get back a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Suspicious budget"
Although ministers did not disclose the details of post-2011 spending, economists said it was clear that cutting public spending would be only the beginning of a medium-term cutback.
The Institute for Budget Studies said the chancellor’s figures indicated significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defense in the near future.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All the important statements will come after the election if we win," Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte account reviror, said in a statement.
"This was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI investigating 'US prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation at a prison in Pakistan into five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were arrested for the attack on a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, according to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who had been reported missing last month at their home in Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested to know under what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were detained there," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the incarceration and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a home belonging to one of their uncles.
It stated that the house had always been the focus of local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to unearth the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from their homes in northern Virginia was announced by their families in late November.
Amnesty for Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been for the last 20 years, according to an Amnesty International report.
The report details the "methods of torture" under the regime before and after the disputed June presidential election.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of this report on respect for human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been jailed and dozens killed after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens have been arrested and prosecutors have sentenced the last five to death.
The BBC's correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini had declared the ineligibility of some forms of torture and banned their execution in the Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of the rule of law have been tolerated, as our correspondent put it.
False Confessions"
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer scientist Ibrahim Methari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he said in testimony.
“They burned cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head...They threatened me with execution and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the streets, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the protests and tortured to death in prison, with the others raped.
Senior Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election riots and the government's response, but said the authorities' mandate and powers were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope has been created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol landmark into a downhill track for the race.
The ski run for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of the 100 m long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill course, but that it was really daunting.
It was a beautiful view of the city's flashing lights below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents."
The prizes were awarded for the best stunts - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
It's always them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minarets and alarmist reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe were spreading, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed, wondering if Muslims could integrate - and if they would integrate - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some readers have become admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the background.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care for five to six million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues that are being debated that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among them well-known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how one can be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that they are the opposite of Selafi’s Saudi-affiliated Sunni Islam, a small group that influences European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromise on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends the general public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
He is of the opinion that Muslims are likely to have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism he found "tightening bolts of value".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The bleakest prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than any other environment on the planet.
Boundary ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like no other.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers on waking them up.
In "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers attempting to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a brave 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only with a musket canker is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears were performing in one circus tent at a time.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area millions of times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Drawing on the works of other writers and historians, Mr. Ellis often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis and all are armed with powerful assault rifles to shoot their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and uncomfortably responsible science for the Arctic and a gripping glimpse into how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have all the answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of exams.
The research trips of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicated for the first time how the movement of floating ice occurs.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped shifting watersheds as they submerged them.
Satellite surveying and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to intrepid individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the Arctic ice catchment system, created by the runoff of salt water, which contracts as it freezes.
But from the height of that bear to the microscopic wonders within, all of this is doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice shifts, which takes place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 Marines Lay Wreaths on Arlington Graves
Petty Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day in which they paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, so that he will show me respect, just as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at Veterans Cemetery in several wards during a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Society in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a memorial service in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition for Mr. nMorell and his wife, Karen, to make this journey each year, stopping in different cities along the way to honor the memory of military members and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America, which they are laying in other states as well.
That year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon Territory, the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the landmark site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her way to return what makes a victim.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in warm cloth, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed for older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the grey tombstones.
Each ring garland was dark green with a small red arch of the nose top.
Nearby, in Ward 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was a real silence.
The associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the ward, but the bleak mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some wept earnestly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cool air.
Some read the names out loud, carved into the stones, while others bent down to view small black and white nameplates, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped the tears from her eyes before her son’s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Navy Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid the price, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
US government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government jailed a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, according to State Department officials on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, worked for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was jailed on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be jailed for almost anything that qualifies as “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical essays, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to accept the awards, but was denied permission.
The arrest of the US contractor may be the result of growing tensions between Castro's communist brother, ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been pursued as a "restraint tactic" in improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report on the arrests on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners, and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought after commodities in a country where the average salary of a state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors, and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to apply, must disclose their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for punitive actions such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a press officer with the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which in any other open society would be legal - say, free cell phones - are a criminal offense in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Enforcement Group's program, which recently published an unfavorable report on Cuba's freedoms, entitled "The New Castro, the Same Cuba," as an allusion to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader and replacement for the ailing older brother of Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said all solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative response in the United States, just as the two countries are moving toward more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed the alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case could help unravel a vast network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of the men posted a comment endorsing the terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifullah took charge of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the zone of the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terror network.
As a result, they were dropped for days into the eastern district of Sarghody, away from the menacing mountains in the northwest that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
The reason they were dropped was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain approval to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the exercise of Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were interrogated by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has given top priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters function as watchmen, knocking out those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. false recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA, said that terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years about allowing them to access them, as US intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to break into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one that is much more web-based.
Tens of Thousands Protest in Copenhagen, Demand Climate ‘Action’
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets this Saturday demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella City Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet, and a handful of masked activists laid several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of a minor event in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners reading "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-class) and one in Spanish that proclaimed "The Earth says 'enough'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and gave me information about the bleak state of the country, which is involved in the impact of the climate changes that are still taking place.
That's part of the reason we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the leaders of the world to come up with a fair, ambitious, and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching downtown Bella, saying they had detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the uninvolved spectators, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits laid several charges near Copenhagen's main canal, located near several ministries.
They agitated near the buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then there were "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied, "Indeed, that is something that I was not aware of."
He then went on to say in Chinese, "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He observed whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
We can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that this is a violation of the actions or freedom of other people.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week's Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of the good news regarding Columbia's public education district.
While the district lags far behind the country’s high-performing systems, the certificate has shown greater progress among fourth- and eighth-grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York City.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers from the National Attestation Center for Teaching Progress are the persistent differences in knowledge between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in the District of Columbia over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American peers have only grown by three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the knowledge gap increased from 53 to 57 between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains broadly balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point shift from 245 to 245.
The average result for white students was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The six-year picture is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved among children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly came close to 58.
Some district education advocates said in the last week that the results, hailed by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more widely stimulated in white students where already high scores were.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of education in the district.
I don't jump up and down because of the scattering of two or three points, said committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's report, Mrs. Brown said that reporting on the test results meant the city's secondary education system was in a dire state and required attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what is frightening is that we have devoted almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Mrs. Rhee said the district's goal is to continue looking for better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at upper-secondary and high-school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their collegiate career and lag significantly behind their peers.
The day-to-day mathematics and curriculum of sixth grade math teaching, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that made it to the precinct under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP reported last week.
And I just think that we should keep working and doing the best we can with those students who stay below the class level, Mrs Rhee said.
Others stated that NAEP's results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is necessary to narrow the gap.
It’s a definite dilemma for Ms. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies test scores in urban areas.
The conventional procedure of redress is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political repercussions that go against an important agenda.
But the criticism also belongs to the other city directors, who are trying to keep a middle ground between whites and blacks.
We must focus on building a system of large schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can count on their children to receive excellent public education.
In an interview this week, Mr. Janey, now the school principal of Newark, said that an essential element of reducing the gap between the results achieved is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the precinct, to realize the legitimacy of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr Janey, who contracted with his teachers' association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a "symptom" for seeking a larger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg college with a loud breather.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and for a moment rested on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from college in El Salvador.
To date, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the dormitory grounds.
Now she and other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their standing was rather than frightened visitors excited potential students.
That's it! cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they were told the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania dorm was one of seven they had visited on their three-day trip, and now they were completely intrigued by the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the dorm.
The question is where.
However, this is a major problem for the high number of U.S.-born children of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from universities or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "second generation" of Spanish college students -- a remarkable achievement -- report that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, made it to the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, say researchers, because it underscores their point of way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who achieved higher education say they had a natural inclination toward school and an innate drive and drive to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to graduate from college - especially if these efforts persist over time.
Taking into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents lack the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We have to think about providing these children with a safety net in preschool age in every way possible, so that they go through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparatory programs that start for students from small-income groups in high schools and continue until those students graduate.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered college, according to U.S. Department of Education data.
Iraq's oil ministry reaches deal with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their sickly infrastructure during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten deals have been struck by Iraq’s oil ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies exited with a capital stake in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached an agreement on the field, which was auctioned in June.
U.S. oil giants’ participation in Iraq’s open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the road in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That will be long before anything else is up for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by the massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the U.S. military withdrawal, are likely to discourage U.S. companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has proven to have the third largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the Department.
Leading U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with Iraq’s oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
China's state-owned National Petroleum Corp. has been involved in bids for more contracts than all the other companies, leaving with large stakes in contracts for two major fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological force, oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the ministry according to the price per barrel, and the ministry is willing to pay to boost output above current levels on each field.
A top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
The impact of a U.S. missile near the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week appears to have killed al-Qaeda's top operational planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
It could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets landed on their wagon near the city of Miran'ah in Sevverny Vaziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have reported that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of a type operated by the CIA in the zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were routed to a white car that was heading toward the Afghan border when it was hit, an official said, along with Pakistan's Cicilian intelligence agency, which was making a phone call from the Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism department officials cited an unspecified witness as saying Somali was poi of death.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside the areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in dream-making around the world, said a senior official who did not wish to be named, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda’s top leadership to plan possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said that Somali was rapidly advancing in al-Qaeda's hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure to some Americans, but that he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somali should be the second high-ranking al-Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when Najmudin Yalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the Aboriginal tribal belt, and three other top populist leaders were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War newspaper records, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may have a reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people they suspected of being informants, the site said.
The United Nations' top delegate in Kabul stepped down.
The top United Nations delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed election for president.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegation said it supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for the reduction, which begins in 18 months, should be a call for governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel assisting in the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but that he was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it’s high time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for a replacement.
Officials said a decision was being made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led a UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's status in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but stated that Galgraith's allegations -- which were dismissed -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the top representative of the citizens to coordinate the relief efforts of the U.S. leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, saying he would want to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the curtailment of his efforts in Afghanistan, saying the cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined her ability to use capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran due to a lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of the war-torn regions of Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good option for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I’ve learned anything from Iraq in the last six years is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its residents will suffer exceptionally" from sanctions.
According to a statement issued Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leaders in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN nuclear safety committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly because, says the expert, the Iraqi leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iran’s stubbornness towards the international community for some of the proposals that it actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it put the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians.
President Obama set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated allegations" before some members of the Security Committee about Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dampen Kurdish concern over the lingering depression. U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzaan, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they were taught that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We didn’t keep anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources administrator who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been introduced, creating two generations of only notoriously cuddled and clumsy children, affectionately dubbed "little emperors", the country is threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before politics went into effect, according to UN figures.
Population distribution, where the population aged 60 and above is projected to grow tumultuously from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050, is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of the Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the workforce in the future".
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden".
Gradual reassurance
As inserted into the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate ever introduced under Communist Party rule to this day.
The couples who violated the policy faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official sites have pursued policies that have helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in pursuing policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to abort their second child.
In addition, many couples have had sexist selective abortions, resulting in unnaturally high male-to-female ratios.
In recent years, population officials have been progressively more lenient in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were only children - and in 2007 they relaxed the diction of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing’s Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incite more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of the ordinance detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Grieving response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples wanting to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city's precincts have not reported changes.
The Huinan Municipal District with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a physical safety net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is married to her first child when she is seven months pregnant.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resources administrator, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of attention of our families and we were all cared for.
We weren’t used to providing care, and we didn’t really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, expressed this much more openly.
For middle-class two-career parents who have reduced the birth rate, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds see their parents as struggling through the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism, and they don’t want that kind of sustenance for themselves, he says.
It’s one child who makes enormous demands on parents’ time, she says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the disputable questions of propstor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume ready by the time the child is 9 months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unruly attitudes and mutual defamation -- focused once again on Friday to release a document proposing ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near future.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But there has been significant progress in negotiations that have taken place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text subtly states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output, and what should be the upper limit on the global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, executive director of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, abbreviated from 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what the top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
On Friday, the European Union urgently discussed a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
However, Friday still featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week’s interviews.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected a speech calling for a binding cut in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering for major emerging economies if not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China by running Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without transferring major developing countries and carrying out actions, Stern said, also complaining that the text was not sufficient to secure the restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after China's deputy foreign minister He Yafei told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" had led to the announcement earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the world’s major economic powers at stake, tensions have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly for the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States to meet their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world’s two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate to Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding ways to zak preventing large issuers responsibly in their actions.
It’s clearly a game about the new economic hegemony being developed, said Ulate, who also serves as regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue enforcing the legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but a majority of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said enforcement by small island nations "has raised a political tug over the entire political process" partly because they are now united and are demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations sparked a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before heads of government would contest the deal.
High-ranking officials such as India’s environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, and China’s deputy minister stepped off planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to closed doors meetings and new conferences so they could set claims that will be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering - with 13,000 people moving daily from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staging ironic spectacles at night about the countries they thought they had sent, and hand-to-hand submissions on paper rather than e-mail - controlled by challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We have come into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy in International Nature Conservation.
Here come the heavy weights.
Britain's first 140-mile-an-hour train redefined feelings this Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of a train that revolutionized transportation in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train reaches 140 miles per hour and flies from Ashford, Kent to London's St Pancras, covering a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and boarded the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
It hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Neglected stagnant waters should cut passenger and business travel times, and switching from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties have allowed themselves to be won over for this vision.
But the tens of quills of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now put the brakes on the construction of Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a feasible study to the government, relayed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as reported by the Times.
It provided him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route linking London to West Midland has been proposed within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where the environment could be problematic.
In the open countryside, the final route was planned within 25 m.
HS2 also foresees three choices for a large-scale high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped coniculation, when one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The line should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has been made," he said, and an expert on railways.
Once this is done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to run at 2,250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry trains of 400 m in length, which would be able to carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Due to capital constraints, the existing station is expected to expand to accommodate a high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement the scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be taken before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but on already existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point of contact to ensure the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers paid off a 75,000-pound mortgage on the Tories' orangery
Alan Duncan, holder of the Tory front seat bench in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by taxpayers last year for an orangery he had built at his home in the constituency.
A party spokesman for the prisons, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on rations", raised his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build an oak-clad extension at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner and so were not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg, who carried out the checks on member expenditures. Last night Mr. Duncan voiced his demands "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-story houses in the village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is marked as an "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for fun and entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Municipal Standards and Privileges Committee in the final mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupillary security to a mortgage of 271406 pounds from his estate in London to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Commons.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan had claimed approximately 1,400 pounds a month in interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1800 pounds per month.
The interest of Mr. Duncan's RBS mortgage payments could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard RBS mortgage payment variable fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, with which it remained.
The last document of the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim ?1250 per month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as Shadow Leader of the House in September after a secret news reporter filmed him saying that MPs must survive "attribution" following the spending scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to live on rations and you're treated like a f**k."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and claim and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May when it turned out he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before being approved by the tax office that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently Legg."
He added: "This is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzaging or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's it.
That wouldn’t be much simpler or cleaner.”
Come and see the cottage on the coast of Brighton with an Advent calendar.
Brighton's coastal lodges have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages dutiful enjoyment with creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas collets as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to view the last hut from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, and the bishop's bread and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and The First Noel, with the cottage featuring the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, assistant in television marketing from Hove, is a non-scholarship priest in the Diocese of Chichester and the head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to an alien old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the cottages originated just as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
A strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt a deal by Friday, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, which is clearly evidenced by the current manifestations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of eventual failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began smashing shop windows with paving stones and hammers.
The riot police immediately intervened.
A total of 600 to 700 people have been arrested by police, saying they were mainly members of the “Blacks Blocks”, ultra-radical stand-alone groups that had already made their appearance at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Coalition for Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "indiscriminately" and stressed that about a hundred were in handcuffs and sitting "held in the streets still Saturday night" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was built for the speakers, in front of which a candlelit spiritual meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were large numbers of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the urging of Friends of the Earth to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand the settlement of ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: it’s time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses are drying up, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the movement to fight for another world has moved closer to ecological organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
Several hundred people, mostly students, marched in Manila dressed in red and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta and Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia Elects Its President, Georgia Condemns It as 'Fake'
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi declared the move a “farce.”
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict that killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvarčija Světlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapse.
She was one of those who came to vote in a polling station at a school in the capital, Suchumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts beautiful nature.
Throughout this small country of 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards are placed with Bagapsh alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the Russian officials, who came to oversee the successful conduct of the elections, received a warm welcome from the district mayor Beslan Aršba.
“We, the Abkhazians, are grateful,” he said in a small ceremony, keeping in mind Moscow’s support and, in particular, its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament and drank a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized contracts made with Moscow last year, such as a contract that allows Russia to control the Abkhazian rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive duel must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestation in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating a deal that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to break in.
A stage was built for the speakers, in front of which a candlelit spiritual meeting took place with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of several hundred protesters, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break down shop windows.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several protesters to the ground.
A total of 600 to 700 people have been arrested by police, saying they were mainly members of the “Blacks Blocks”, ultra-radical stand-alone groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured by a cobblestone on his jaw and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incident, resulting in about 20 arrests, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters flew up again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue raincoats, formed the first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the urging of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has called on several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students dressed in red and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, were demonstrating in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines.
Several hundred protesters in Hong Kong and Jakarta have also met to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Several dozen people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said during an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that the subjects of history and geography would be "reinforced" as part of the reform of the general grammar school, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the grammar school with a focus on the exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week, and everyone will have the same program in general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "hypocrisy has to be stopped" because, according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on the exact sciences, but "essentially the best students are in it".
The ES and L specializations cannot be for S's kind of sub-specializations, he continues, stressing, "I haven't heard many historians and intellectuals complain that they don't learn geography and history in their final year of professional grammar schools".
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by Humanité, showed that seven out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography education in their senior year with an S specialization, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the cancellation, both on the left and some on the right.
On the contrary, the minister added that "it is not an option" to cancel the philosophy in the program of specialization S graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which they say will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future gymnasium professors.
As part of Master’s studies 2 (M2) they will take an entrance examination at the beginning of the year focused on their field and at the end of the year another examination to verify their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of the master's degree and will perform as a professor-trainee in front of the pupils for the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission process, you will gain more experience with the pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reconfirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the call announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC), at the instigation of the University Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar composed of 15 minutes of expert input that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them more eager to learn more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who was named after a fish from a local pond that the students named this way.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
“We can talk for hours about climate warming, but we can also summarize the basic targets in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking in front of 50 listeners with no pre-made notes, using only graphs.
This is part of our scientific work, he stressed, with the hope that listeners will recognize that “the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific basis.”
Videos of these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is planned for February, and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
Unions of prison guards announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demand that bonuses and overtime be paid before the Christmas holidays, the payment of which has been postponed to January for financial reasons.
The prison's FO (2nd Guards' Union) asked employees who would not be on duty to attend a demonstration held in front of the prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block" them in order to draw attention to "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison guards (3rd Department of this sector) called on them to "convene the assembly in individual prisons and initiate a major mobilization" on the grounds that it is "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and bonuses for night work, on Sundays and on public holidays" worked in October, will not be paid in December.
The First Union of Wardens, the Federal Union of Prison Wardens (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime hours increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Mari had sent a note to the prison guards' union, reassuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the minister said in a statement.
I have ordered the Administrative Directorate of Prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which resulted from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, will never be repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari said.
Thus, December's wages will be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous bonuses for performing their duties and meeting goals, Ufap/Unsa reports, and for those "there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union FO in Marseille has become indignant and has announced its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and summonses".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays, if they are not reimbursed for these days in October, as well as for overtime, there is also a risk of FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, says the CGT-prison overseers in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, funding is scarce, said Ufap Secretary-General Jean-Francois Forget.
Obama Says He Gives 'Better Gifts' On Christmas Than The Ones He Receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told Oprah Winfrey, the screen goddess, that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: “I give better gifts than the ones I get.”
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air on Sunday night on ABC, about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, gets his treat.
Baby Jesus also likes Bo, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would also "obviously" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show's pre-show broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claim about the quality of the gifts he was given: “Oh, no, I gave you some nice gifts last year.”
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately afterwards he pointed with humor at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?".
On this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous anchorwoman who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also talked about their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama introduced the 10-speed bike, as well as a basketball donated to him by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely met.
I remember when I saw my father who came to see us at Christmas and gave me the basketball, the president told me.
It was only a long time later that I realized that he had actually given me the ball.
The first lady remembered the doll house.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved the little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday Operated Again, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles due to "injury" resulting from a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control," according to his closest friends, while RTL said the singer is in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors said he had "injured himself" from a herniated disc in Paris on November 26, according to his press department in Paris, saying the lesions required "corrective surgery."
The singer's press department, however, sought to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" and also announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's final tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will be a little more confident, adds RTL.
The press department, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that according to "some sources" no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a herniated disc.
The surgery, which had been scheduled several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
The doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL's information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad period" but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he was a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, singer Jean-Claude Camus, a producer, calmed the situation, stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for "a small tumor of the small intestine" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, everyone's health problem is very much monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the news of the new hospitalisation.
Euro-2009/small pool: Bousquet's premiere in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships in a large pool, won the 2009 European Championships in a small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, when overalls were last allowed, only three world records were set, although many more were expected.
One of them overcame the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová for the 200 m position race and the two remaining men's relay of Russia for the 4x50 m position race.
A great sorrow for Bousquet, who set a world record on the 50 m freestyle, of which he is already the holder in a large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which ten swimmers took off for the first time instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The overalls have helped to set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which hosted them for the first time in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the jumpsuit this time did not help Paul Biedermann, the two-time world champion in a large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400 metres freestyle record (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I wouldn’t break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender for the future, Biedermann explained.
Zola’s sarcophagus sold for $1.5 million
A plaque of a Romanesque sarcophagus that belonged to none other than French writer Emil Zola was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than estimated, art dealer Sotheby's said.
The cost of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-high headboard, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchants is a rare piece, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still going on, but it is probably the item most bid on, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then it gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated a bathtub with it in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before taking power Marshal Petain.
There it remained shadowed for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found, while searching the Louvre Museum database, that this record was part of the "remains of Emil Zola" opened from 1903, a year after the author's death "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
An aborted attempt by President Zelaya to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico decided Thursday that the conditions for the transfer of the deposed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After a phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to carry out this transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back again, a source with the Directorate General for Migration said.
The coup d'état government wanted to force President Zelaya to "depart" and apply for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe exit.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state in exile.
The coup government “has experienced another setback, wanting me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the political crisis that has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, the deposed president added, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept this because it does not contain an asylum request, the interior minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with the Caracas-based Telesur station.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilised supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday who had come to rally around the embassy of Brazil, where the military had stepped up protection.
Brazil's foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the putschist government's stance.
They show their marginal attitude towards international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who had become close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was toppled on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out of there, he will be arrested and will be held accountable for the crime of "treason" of which he is accused, according to the coup government.
Roberto Micheletti, the president of the United States, managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo won the controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Inspires Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an increase, and the US trade balance shows an increase in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on a “half-full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused primarily on US trade balance figures, "which show activity improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, were expecting an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations, and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to its lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also fallen.
The yield of the state treasures with a 10-year perspective increased to 3.482%, compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening, and the yield of 30 years increased to 4.492%, compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana on World Human Rights Day on Thursday, preventing another demonstration that arrested dozens of dissidents.
About forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners were booed right on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they marched towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the regime's uplifted supporters to dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who had come to "ensure security."
The day before, there had been a similar demonstration in Havana against the "Ladies in White", but there had been no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, some ten dissidents were detained by plainclothes police who were also going to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, a journalist told AFP.
According to this journalist, the police loaded dissidents who had been booed by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
The arrest of dissidents in similar conditions takes only a few hours from the rule.
The winners of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in White", organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their archenemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of supporters of the regime against the "opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist Party at its head and a one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disregarding human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman with a knife killed an 80-year-old man and injured 5 people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during a rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the attacker, aged 28, allegedly attacked with two knives and, for unknown reasons, an 80-year-old man in the pharmacy or in front of it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely injured old man, born in 1929, died in hospital as a result of his injuries, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the attacker then attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
My husband, about 30 years old, started to fight back and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital in which an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock," the police source said.
An armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as reported by a police source, then fled into the street, still on the boulevard of Jean Jaures.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How it all happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried cross behind his back, said on the spot the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimonies gathered by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed to do so because he was quite strong, commenting on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A mob, including one city police officer, broke his wrist, he added.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man and were wounded in the process with their fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large wound on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 30 years old, arrived who also had stab wounds with a knife.
The man, who had no identity documents, was later arrested by the state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the Investigation Department of the Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting to be interrogated.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to manage him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "completely out of himself" as "all lunatics of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action".
U.S. Attorney Asks Polanski to Stop Prosecution
A lawyer for Polish-French director Roman Polanski has again filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles, California, to stop criminal proceedings against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the film's director, "The Pianist," criticized before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeals in California the serious errors that occurred during the 1977 trial.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now, lawyer Hummel said, adding that Laurence Rittenbanda "had a chill in his back" from the conduct of the judge who was adjudicating the case at the time.
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was allegedly dealing with a prosecutor before the sentence was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison - a serious offense against the rule of law.
Information about this conversation appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the public prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually stated in late September that he had "lyed" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, lawyer Hummel will request a court hearing in which he will be able to present evidence of his claims.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state level, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to cease criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled in a case involving "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never returned to the United States since.
The Los Angeles deputy prosecutor, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
Do we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants, that it is possible to escape?
He is of the opinion that the director "is asking for the court's kindness and at the same time disdaining its authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to take the decision, also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel's lawyer was not the only one to ask Roman Polanski to stop the prosecution.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also called again for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer stand the constant harassment every time Polanski's case surfaced, adding: "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski arrested in Switzerland on September 26
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible expulsion.
Wall Street exits without direction, but is held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed Friday with no direction, the market tossed between indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and a rising dollar price: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final cut-off, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and finished at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that have "helped to improve the mood of the market in terms of the stability of the economic recovery," summed up the analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row, and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month.
But the indexes were held back by a new rise in the dollar’s price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, “pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology is losing ground.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield of the Treasury with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year outlook it increased to 4.497% versus 4.492% the day before.
Miss World is back in South Africa.
After a month-long trip across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great beauty celebration has been held in the Johannesburg area for the second year and so far five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao of Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen so many things and I’ve had so many experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
I couldn't dream of a more beautiful country to wear a crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I’m happy to have experienced it twice, said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the rediscovery of the country and its “breathtaking country”.
After a month of performances, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participates in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese television presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chair Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown it can welcome a world with a warmth that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates went on safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
A special event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely be returning to the 2010 World Cup, says Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm Miss Italy.
According to son David, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive", as his son David assured us on his arrival at Los Angeles Airport on Friday, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
“It’s very strong and it’s going very well,” said Hallyday as he got off the plane from Paris just after 1 p.m.
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would arrive "as soon as possible" at Cedars-Sinac Hospital in Los Angeles, where Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection following a prolapsed intervertebral disc surgery he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press statement, the singerthis night in Los Angeles, for convenience, was "put into an artificial sleep" to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday has been placed in an artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sina Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection following an operation on a prolapsed intervertebral disc in Paris on November 26.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again during the night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife, Laeticia, attended a school performance of the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpetriére Hospital, said he was flying to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer blamed Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons from Los Angeles said they were outraged, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went to Los Angeles too quickly and with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me a lot, as I myself had already suffered twice with the prolapse of the intervertebral disc, he added.
Earlier, he told RTL radio that the singer had apparently left after a Paris surgery without a drain, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Medical Chamber Attorney Olivier Metzner called him a "scrupulous person" who is "regularly" summoned before the Medical Chamber and who cannot even be "recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux addressed the matter on Friday through his attorney David Koubbi.
He said the procedure was "absolutely good" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer’s health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain a question mark.
It is clear that the resumption of the scheduled tour on January 8 seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF is raising the tone and calling on the Nouveau Centre to no longer use their acronym.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrancois Bayrou, responded on Friday to an attempt by Nouveau Centre party president Hervé Morin to appropriate the acronyms of the former Giscard party, saying it must not use the abbreviation in any media under threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to usurp the UDF acronym, saying that Francois Bayrou did not deserve to carry her legacy after shaking the left's hand.
The Defense Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday in front of the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) movement.
This move gained the support of Hervé de Charetto, a former MP now for NC, who claims ownership of the UDF brand because he first registered it with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, a committee of the UDF Association, run by friends of Francois Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, stepped out of its silence and made a formal request to both the minister and MPs to stop using the shortcut and hand back ownership of the trademark, under threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the worrying statements that you will propose to your political movement to retake the UDF acronym, writes the Association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, such as Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem party or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to put the name +Nouveau centre+ on your promotional materials and on the welcome page of your movement, with the slogan +UDF today+, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the UDF committee, which requests the NC movement "immediately remove all references to the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you fail to do so, we will go to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to form a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to establish the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau Centre movement has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie francaise).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to form a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years" but a UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used non-existent registration acronyms to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion is beginning to turn into a crime, they claim, and then ironically comment on NC's strategy: "It seems to us that, both in politics and in everyday life, it is more valuable to make a name for ourselves than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name to which we have no right".
The case of Liliane Bettencourt : Francois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try artist Francois-Marie Banier and decide whether he used the state of weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, according to her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of famous people, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a crime for which a penalty of a maximum of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros is imposed.
The ruling confirms that there will indeed be a trial in what could be called the family saga of one of the wealthiest families in France, in which a mother and daughter are attacking each other and fighting over the management of L’Oréal’s beauty empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be conducted by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and chief shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre prosecutor’s office during the investigation.
The doctors, who will be elected on Friday, should prepare a report by March 10, 2010, and at the same time give a statement as to whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness, and in which period.
I think he's going to do it.
I'll talk to her about it," Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for the lawyer, Francois Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that with this old lady in need of protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It has been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter launched a criminal case against Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and omniscientist whom she blames for years of exploiting her mother’s state of weakness in order to win a billion euros as a gift in the form of checks, life insurance contracts, or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the merits of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, Friday's barrister's speech at times turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer presented three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) had sent to her notary, in which she expressed her disbelief towards Fran ois Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the attorney, adds, "you could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once or twice a day.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Francoise."
The Nanterre prosecutor’s office again found that the applicant’s conduct was not warranted, all the more so since a guardian judge had recently rejected her application to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection to her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in court, she is not under protection or in guardianship.
No one else will act on her behalf," prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney said.
The court ultimately ruled that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's legitimacy would be commented upon at the time of the commencement of the trial.
The Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than a decade, corporate management’s behavior towards employees has reminded them of the way companies approach consumers before the marketing revolution: it’s about aligning co-workers with the “values” determined from the top, as was the case before, when it was necessary to impose on consumers products that came from the ideas of factory technicians’ heads.
By becoming the center of business, the marketing revolution has levelled the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction... even though authoritarian efforts to impose products different from customer preferences regularly come back!
Passive attitude of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread phenomenon affecting mostly managerial cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all the intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, EI "requires of all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires of employees commitments that are completely at odds with the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a managerial revolution, which should aim to put workers at the centre of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - will they contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure, after various turns, will return to what it has always done!
Further, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one's own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of engineering colleges, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of convenience, they adopt an old behavioral theory, now revived by “neurosciences” from the US and widely disseminated without much knowledge of scientific institutes and the media.
The fact that it is possible to move "leverages" (sic) involvement of managers, showed a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on the site Figaro.fr, which only confirms managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a fundamental insight into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is only dealt with in the Motivative Functional Analysis studies.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy, which allows them, through the image that it conveys about the business, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management "on the right track".
This creates a fertile ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: "just war" Obama earned praise from the right.
On Friday, the US right welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, content that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner advocated the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who initially mocked the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had spoken out on the subject of the “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs, which is currently being published.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, justified sending forces on Thursday in Oslo and used the speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another of Obama’s opponents, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a “very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House, who especially appreciated the President's mention of the "existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I found this speech quite historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the Peace Prize if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter of George W. Bush, now editor of The Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech".
Not only did he present himself as a “citizen of the world” as he always did, but he “spoke like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they didn’t create, and that they’re not doing too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
A few right-wing dissenters include Bush-era hawk former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "uniform, pompous, and uninspired," according to the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"If we wrap war in the wrapper of justice, we can easily justify the slaughter of innocent people," he warned.
However, the center-left press has taken a commendable stand against the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to view awarding the Peace Prize to Obama as premature, it assessed his output as "overperforming" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions on conflict resolution, fighting poverty and oppression,” the California daily reported.
Obama "made the speech that needed to be done," the New York Times reviewed, calling the speech "simple and enlightening."
Road hauliers: three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, the road hauliers' union and TLF, the only employers' organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening to end the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, following several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussion, negotiators broke up early on Friday with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTR) withdrew from the meeting.
But it took more than six hours for the meeting to start at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the agreement to be signed at 6 p.m.
This conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "would risk disrupting the holiday season at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains wage increases of 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we will give our members an order that there be no blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may still be a few opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "correct deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high salaries due to international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% revalorisation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of 100 million euros in corporate payroll taxes" which was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill voted on by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consistent" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be slowed down by the disapproval of employers' organizations.
The FNTR calls it "bad trade" because 100 million euros "has already been offered to the sector as compensation for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger the turkey eaters at the time of the approaching Christmas holiday, Unostra complained.
Otre is threatening to bury a large number of small and medium-sized businesses in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: traffic disruption at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The suspension of transport on the RER A suburban line, which is the largest public transport line in France, will continue throughout the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the union and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the question of the premium request.
On Saturday and Sunday, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will run every other train, except this section only one train out of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has made an effort to ensure connections with large department stores".
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section administered by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in rush hour service and virtually no train was running during off-peak hours as planned.
As on Thursday, the residents of the Ile de France arranged themselves differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station than usual, among other reasons, because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time".
Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, the SNCF state railway announced, because a greater number of bailiffs and guards of order were predicted.
RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut were arriving or departing from Saint-Lazare railway station with a metro connection.
Other general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to evaluate the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the unions rated as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all respects, working time adjustment, career progress, etc.
But that’s not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon.
RATP even postponed proposals on the bonus for the time being, scandalizing the CGT, saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem while the travel carriers and SNCF were able to."
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the exercise of the profession will be reviewed closer," RATP said.
Which is why the trade unionists think the business is “making fun of weekend travelers.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now has refused any discussion during the strike, therefore, in the interest of "calming down" decided to meet.
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independent announce a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, including 30 euros of variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are complaining about the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
RER drivers earn between 2,200 and 2,700 euros in gross wages and 600 and 650 euros in bonuses for irregular working hours and work on Sundays and public holidays.
The Turkish justice system has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party, prompting protest demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country's south-east and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to extend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court Chief Justice Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority-seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president Ahmet Turek and MP Aysela Tugluk were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Turk and Ms Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's property by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats (out of 500) in Parliament.
The party leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave the Parliament than act as non-political members.
The ruling is a continuation of a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "fundamental links" with the PKK, but refuses to brand it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government extends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community, offering a range of measures to strengthen their rights, and attempting to limit Kurdish support for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations have degenerated in recent weeks against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is being held in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly inhabited by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from slingshots.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Turk stated that the justice decision would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by a party descended from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against the interference of parties.
“It doesn’t solve anything,” Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, political scientist Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a response from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow can come
A pretty crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services of the FES.
But so that its employees can try and learn to master all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt all over and temperatures drop below zero, they drive on 20 so-called A-sections of the large dumper, Brauburger explains.
These sections include the main and through routes such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstrasse.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descents like the Atzelbergstrasse.
The FES service starts at 3:00 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with moist salt, which holds better, for a maximum of three hours, about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to keep the roads clear when the traffic to work starts".
It doesn’t start snowing until 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers".
Only when it does not snow so much are the access and connecting roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Stra?e.
The last priority is side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot soldiers set out on the road, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually cannot take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As icebergs form quickly, the sprinklers come out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call.
Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday’s issue of the journal Science that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Tawa is opening a new window to an earlier evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about kinship relationships, expansion, and the traits of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unprecedented for triassic deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The discovery confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god Hopi Indians.
It is an unusual find for Sterling Nesbitt: "The fossils of the Triassic dinosaurs are very rare, mostly only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm unreservedly.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into three most important development lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithopschia, which included, for example, species of Ornithops.
Tawa hallae is the original terapod after an analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers have found evidence of air sacs that even the descendants of theropods have birds.
Air sacs make the breathing of birds more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since a related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation has probably created a common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have deduced that lizards appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development soon split and spread from South America to all the continents, which at that time, as a supercontinent of Pangaea, formed a uniform earth mass.
The team found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods along with Tawa hallae.
The three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted picture, as very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, while they are rarely found on other continents.
How dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian genus to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Earth's Middle Ages remains a riddle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while relatives died out and the interface of the Triassic and Jurassic.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or maybe the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
But the success story didn’t last forever.
150 million years later, the impact of the meteorite helped another group of animals, which also evolved into the Triassic and has lived in the shade ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, and Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of Frankfurt's Goethe University caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, as well as colleges across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of police intervention by the Presidium.
Because the walls and works of art were scrawled, University President Werner Muller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers cleared out.
Five students were injured.
The harm to the cause, the signatories say, does not justify "the forcible dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teachers to the police commando".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegalize and criminalize protest" and distract from the content.
The Presidium has avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers are calling for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that the majority of strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth, Verdi Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, the Hesse science minister Eva Kuehne-Hormann (CDU) defends the procedure of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we have no sympathetic to vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the students, a eviction occurred.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a highly guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this 216,000-populated district, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Major micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Center Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow’s vice-mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd prefect Anatoly Smirnov, and the head of planning Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
The scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ will be allowed to take root in the growing Russian market.
Russian scientists are looking for jobs in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, large corporations Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned town" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which research facilities are set.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not prepared at all.
For fans of the project, it is quite simply the "new heart of Europe".
The S21 is more than a train station, more than a monstrous structure that plunges the capital city of Baden-Wuerttemberg into desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks ending in the city center were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes of modern rail transport, because it took enormous time to rewire locomotives from the rear to the front.
To drive, to stop for a while, to go on - that's how it should work.
That’s why the main train stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly halfway along the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about the "heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious designers themselves recognized that in the Hesse and Bavarian cities the start of the construction is almost unaffordable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations no longer have problems with detours and detours.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE line to Ulm.
Local and local politicians have done this.
The railways cooperate because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Czech Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urban planning can be justified in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we trust the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
Passable railway stations and line construction are designed for passenger traffic, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a tremendous increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more seriously, the S21 indirectly affects a number of other railway projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodal points and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty major projects on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, it has been building at a slow pace on this route.
You need to push hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine valley will become the neck of a bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the airport judgment.
The state government has left the Wiesbaden Landtag open if it goes against the Hesse Administrative Court’s (VGH) ruling on the night flight ban and has it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to legally review the more than 400-page VGH judgment, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel today explained in writing that the state would have to re-adjust the night-time flight ban in the event of construction of the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport.
The permit for 17 flights between 23:00 and 5:00, as assumed by the state government, does not correspond to the legally mandated protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to demand a revision of the ruling.
The opposition criticised the postponement and urged representatives of the government to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gombel called on the CDU and FDP to return to the promises they made before the election to ban night flights. Otherwise, it can be considered a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Green chief Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP's campaign slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch has rejected Schäfer-Gombel's reprimand, the state government is trying to get on its night flights through "distortions of law and tricks".
Accurate legal control takes time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Muller (FDP).
His faction’s statements to ban night flights have never been the same as those of the opposition.
U.S. banks to repay aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state shackles.
On Wednesday, Bank of America repaid $45 billion (about 30 billion euros) in aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid.
The constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with accepting money - limiting bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has secured well $19 billion in net worth from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest from her coffers, which were filled, among other things, by union sales.
On Wednesday night, bank chief Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the American taxpayer: The cash injection helped us through a difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the bank took over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC said the bank could have announced a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday.
A spokesman for Citigroup declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off.
Quick Choice
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced a successor just two weeks after ZDF's board of directors pushed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the Bureau wanted to agree on the person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin, was named the favorite.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to pre-empt the process.
But it could also play a role that they did not want to damage ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal was not passed by the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the Bureau's 14 members.
The result of the vote was not known before the deadline for this release.
Two weeks ago, the Schächter board of directors failed with its proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
A majority in the EU’s governing council had signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Opposition to the editor was organized by Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that the ZDF newscast viewing quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Thirty-five state lawyers have recently joined the debate, calling Koch's move unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for S?dwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
1983 Frey transferred to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazines"; to 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the main ZDF studio.
After Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhenish-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Länder should change the state treaty with the ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory boards.
Brender's supposed successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a shrewd chess move - immediately after deposing Brender, he strongly criticized the Bureau for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he could be nominated to the post of editor-in-chief without losing face both Schächter and could be elected by the board of directors without coming under suspicion of being pushed into office by the party.
In party arithmetic, Frey is ranked among left-wing liberals anyway.
Studying gets rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, the ministers of culture finally arrived in the federal states on Thursday: At the conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: As a matter of principle, each study module should be completed with one single exam.
In addition, the workload of learners should be reviewed, and a "fair and defensible degree" should be guaranteed.
To do this, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create more flexible joint structural assignments for Bachelor’s and Master’s degree courses.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in the worm, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about better studies.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council has decided that the number of examinations will be drastically reduced in part: "Each module will usually be terminated by only one examination", says the 30-page report, which is intended to partially regulate the approval of study fields.
"Significantly lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Council, "is to stop a flawed development that has significantly reduced the difficulty of studying."
To do this, the "demand of study" in the future should be the "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and content must be "hardly rechecked" so as not to "unnecessarily restrict learners' choice of
The Seminary.”
Students should be "entitled to a space that allows and supports self-initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years - which means that it will take until 2015 to review all fields of study.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the Länder.
In October, the culture ministers called on the federal states to act on the agencies in such a way that the content of the curriculum is not too large and the examination regime is not strict.
Universities and universities have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures in the individual Länder.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should be used by universities primarily to pay for consulting programs and study advice, and to strengthen testing and foreign offices.
This is what countries and universities want to spend 10 million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to the Parliament.
According to her, only one exam should be required for the completion of the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, in addition to which the recognition of examinations from other universities should be guaranteed and the accessibility of the Master’s degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again argued over the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Juso Higher Education Groups has called for education policymaking not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students as affected persons should "speak a little bit into it".
Future academics also received support from the president of the conference of university rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said at a meeting with culture ministers on Thursday, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree access to an extension master's degree.
Second, the Länder must ensure that there are enough places for today’s generation of bachelor’s degree students in master’s degrees with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The Federal States must employ far more lecturers.
However, the culture ministers did not comment on free access to the master’s programs.
More than a footnote to Herta Muller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Soellner, who in this plucked-out language piece thematizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a teacher of a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
He has been awarded various literary prizes, lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt in 1993, and since 2002 has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A major extra-literary commotion took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where "German literature in Romania was in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security act."
Evidently insecure and distraught, Soellner left a statement in which he confessed to fellow writers by Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, that he was a secret informant for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, he won the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts to recruit began inconspicuously, starting in 1971.
I am, Soellner continued, "someone who has not resisted sufficiently attempts at intimidation by Securitate."
The poet Werner Soellner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Muller and her unprecedented literary dealings with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors coming from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of a political system based on scrutiny and spiking.
Werner Soellner is not only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the acts of Securitate, secret agent Walter played a role, said Michael Markel after Soellner's confession, referring to the positive influence on himself secret agent Walter.
“He was cutting me off on all the important points,” Markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make that remark.
Soellner's statement in this form and in front of this audience was an unexpected, but absolutely surprising admission of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Muller wrote in July, reading her own nudes, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reserve for spyly Securitate.
They will speculate and, in some cases, probably know which name is behind the codenames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Otherwise than in the domestic, in the meantime very certain inspection of the Stazi components, the handling of the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council on Processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the publication of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the components.
The fact that former Securitate members still have a lot of influence in Romania after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Muller showed an interview in which one of the former leaders of the Securitate from Timisoara spoke about the winner of the award in a negative way.
She is said to have had psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The indignity of power has been expressed here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the Suellner case, as in the context of a covert offense.
The peculiar reaction of the listeners to Soellner's confession is to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by the desire for knowledge than by the attribution of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Muller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturated Deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed salesman had come from a cute Christmas party at which a sports goods manufacturer was handing out sweets as a new VfBr coach Christian Gross accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor bag boarded the summoned C-Class Mercedes 15 minutes after midnight.
A man with a striking baldness allowed himself to be driven around a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk with happiness, the 55-year-old man was also little.
It was a pleasant evening, but work will continue tomorrow.
Or it'll just start.
In the words of just three days of committed Swiss: "We have reached the finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be dazzled by success: It will be a brutally tough fight against the relegation."
"Far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And avoid the obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals Marica (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11th).
Draws
The Champions League semi-finals (match 16/17 + 23/24 February/ rematch 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s ascension will therefore be preserved.
Not only the supposed healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to deploy and joy of play in a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be braver, explained Soul Healer Gross such a simple-sounding successful recipe, which, however, under the action of the therapist Babbel showed no effectiveness.
He fanned a certain magic, admitted Babbel's follower Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after many weeks of break caused by injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Babbel was obviously missing it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been rescued, sports chairman Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow, too, before an ugly awakening came after a 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira speculates.
Sports chairman Horst Heldt said one goal had been achieved this season, but the other was still a long way off.
We're not out of the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that freshly came to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the game began.
There are decisions made by others and not Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He pitched to the board of directors a weak lead and decided to change coach after pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also called the cancellation of his post-match day a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "form pure egoism", replied Heldt, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
The two 40-year-olds will probably have no more joy in life.
Anyway, they agree with each other that without the work of the deposed coaching team, such a player-strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had a "great share of success", say Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
World Heavyweight Championship
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson unanimously on points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko, it is the third successful title defense after his return in October 2008.
Before that, Ukrainian was twice World Champion by WBO and WBC organizations.
Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be the k.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, being defeated twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th duel.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko led a 2.02-meter-high duel primarily with his left hand.
However, the smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko’s era before the duel, withdrew before the World Champion’s blows, so Klitschko could not take the decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In total, passive Johnson did quite a bit on the challenger and was just trying to get into the next rounds.
Although Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, his punches rarely hit the world champion.
Still, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klitschko for twelve full rounds.
The challenger caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "dirty zombie" who "can't do anything properly".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion let himself be provoked, pulling the sunglasses off Johnson's nose "so he could see his eyes".
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years in the break, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba to defend the title, and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
In this fight I received only one shot and I was physically in good shape, Klitschko justified a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the World Champion of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by David Haye after he dethroned Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye canceled a fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promoter company is reportedly planning a duel against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: The Greens’ leader, Yuergen Trittin, called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister told a "knowingly untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, Greens faction leader Jurgen Trittin said on Saturday's ARD news program "Tagesschau".
Let’s call it the usual expression: He lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not just the destruction of hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. airstrike, demanded by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, killed or injured as many as 142 people, according to a NATO investigation.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel needs to explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Bundestag's policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence services have endorsed the new strategy, said Juergen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Koenast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the Bundeswehr's specific deployment in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the ministry's proceedings on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tankers.
It was officially said that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, it was said by both top officials that they drew the Ministry of Defence's attention to several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the meantime in a letter for clarification of the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received a response.
The ministry did not comment on the complaints on Saturday and pointed out that this will be addressed in the investigative committee of the Bundestag, which will be appointed next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in their waking state and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
It is not just the mentally ill or drugged that blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fanciful mirages.
But in today’s Western world, those who experience dream states, see and hear things that others don’t see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, or at least odd.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality flow.
Dreams of altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of delirium, psychosis, and hallucination can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain's neuronal transmitters - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is derailed, and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The link between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle saw hallucinations as a form of waking dream, and Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 that "there was a great similarity between delirium and dream states"; for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, mirages, deceiving of the senses".
It's fall 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and brightly colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it hovers at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, valuing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery boots, throw him against walls, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a loop, and fastens it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
Loop's loose.
Learn, shout chorus voices ripping his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD has been triggered.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, taking drugs for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fears and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the sufferers can no longer distinguish the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The sufferer is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the floodgates to thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is impossible.
Experience a hallucination once in a lifetime
Other than in a dream, Fuchss says, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which one perceives in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why exactly our brains are doing such flips.
Emergencies can lead anyone to lose touch with reality in the short term, Fuchs says.
But not everyone develops into a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that people with disabilities have minimal brain damage.
We believe that early in development, there will be damage to the neuronal maturation of the brain, for example, by the mother's viral diseases during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
However, it remains a puzzle as to how the neuronal system malfunctions, which has not manifested itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition for it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain breaks down
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and in order to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs in order to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of L beck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Unreal world in our head).
Hallucinations are typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally repressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too little repressed; when our brain becomes sagging, or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends a grammar school there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the shapes and the voices.
During breaks, she may be approached by a long-haired, dark-haired smoothie.
When he answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl is considered a uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't eat, she knows that.
He's awake, he can hear and see the boy, just like he can hear and see the girl sitting next to him in the desk.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling. She likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other mirages are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the signs are rather dismal.
They are often a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is the new classmate, but he explains to everyone else in a clear and visible way on the board of mathematical equations.
At night the appearances are rather disheartening.
When she waits in her dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she's crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she has not gone crazy.
Imagination is also an art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or deprived of stimulation, they are likely to hallucinate, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to do its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she’d been calling her dad since she thought for herself was not her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain regions are active, which also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, like Sarah K., to distinguish between delusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, and reality is also displayed there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, which is why it feels so real.”
Night dreams are also evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations in healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises her patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The Borderline Between Dream and Hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the Psychiatric and Psychotherapy Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Dusseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - the mirage is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the affected person considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full consciousness motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by the continued, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between a dream and a hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to manage a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation becomes present into the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transference in an unbearable situation that allows humans to move into loss of consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of the Heart) as a soul rescue action.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness went on a several-day journey while his body lay motionless in an intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into the world he has created, visiting alien times and places: He becomes an old man confined to his bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotics from blood.
On a motorbike, a Greek kidnaps him to his home country, surfs a firn in the Alps on a hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
The dream is a different state, it describes your experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear years later and in non-essential details.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, Kasten summarizes, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The 27 have to take over the publishing children
The new head of the publishing house Kallen is a transitional solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding will also belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man of SPIEGEL.
We have discussed the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked afterwards.
The question is whether they have the skills.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees in charge of their children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was pulling out of the board's chairmanship since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Cashier section, responsibility for the company's assets was added, and after the resignation of Juergen Todenhofer also Direct Marketing, Abroad, Press and Finance.
For the first time, no family members are in charge of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should also belong to a 100% family in the future, Burda says.
Regarding the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even family businesses are not confident before the demise: "It has always affected companies that have let themselves be infected by the desire for capital that they have speculated and thought they can become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda said.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you can wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is at your fingertips.
El Corte Inglés has just launched the Callao (Madrid) shopping centre of more than 1,000 m2, which provides a variety of body care services.

Escotes variados
Christmas is coming and this is the time when it is advisable to find out what celebrities are wearing, and to adapt their festive wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to note.
We make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Endesa energy company together with the Barcelona City Hall founded 'Office LIVE'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the Catalan capital.
LIVE’ (Electric Vehicle Logistics) will set up and manage the roadmap for the deployment of electric vehicles in the city and will secure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 ‘Electric cities’
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa’s involvement in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects, such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'rest period' for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that Spain's auto industry, the nation's main export sector, is facing a "rest period".
In the Prime Minister's economic report for 2009, Zapatero summarised the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a competitive plan for the automotive sector, we would be facing a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our major manufacturing companies,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm for this industry, which is our main export sector, is expected in the future,” he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Automotive Integral Plan (PIA), earmarked 800 million for projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliaries, which mobilised an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government’s measures to support the requirement and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed to reduce by 6% the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, namely in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid’s Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which will be represented by more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid will also be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and curious.
The participating companies will be: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialist firm of Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding training sessions, sporting performances, fitness tests, presentations and auditions.
There will also be proficiency tests for classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining a sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on sports style.
That’s why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system, also christened i-Stop, a device that is currently only available with a 2.0-150hp gasoline engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using the toolkit and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that the Honda Civic also presents.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product provides more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is worth mentioning the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers in a year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced fuel consumption.
In terms of equipment, the version chosen for testing is called Sportive and includes a greater number of serial elements.
In the case of standard equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the appearance of a blind spot, thrust and stability control, speed control, interior mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio, and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1.500 euros: adaptable double-xenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized mainly by the quality of materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive a larger number of kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a 2.0- and 150-horsepower gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the brand's new sleek and sexy 'Nine' models. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is used only for viewing mail, without the ability to view certain types of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine honored him as one of the products of the year.
It's harder to see him out there, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other based on the permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings surprises.
The monthly price for maintenance is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or to impatiently look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for roaming tariffs to be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
That such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it continues to have the Fon name when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering various offers to compensate their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for when purchased, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen in the case of FonPeek, it’s a permanent access purchase option like this Peek has already implemented in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from a consumer point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
She chose a dress and a coat of this color for Barack Obama’s presidency, and she chose the same color to accompany him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with shimmering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece ensemble - a dress, a jacket and a coat made of the same fabric - embellished with a large embroidery or a collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturias princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes the two models very different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heel, nowsimilar to the model, but in gold color.
They also wear various hairstyles: this timecrushed, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and career of Spanish women', carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market because of motherhood.
The study highlights that, at the start of cohabitation, there are many differences of opinion about the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, as well as the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier, and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable jobs, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer children.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with a stable job have their first child on average 3.7 years after the start of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to achieving a stable job and have therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of starting a life with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage andthe birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 and 32.1, respectively.
“There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education get married and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education do the opposite, preferring to get a stable job, before getting married and having their first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of actresses: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
One of the most elegant international actresses, Joyeux Noel joins the ranks of other famous L’Oréal Paris celebrities, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penélope Cruz.
Prior to that, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('House Millionaire') had joined this select club.
The men's section of the cosmetics brand is also represented by notable personalities: Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, past and present - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing from the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
Manuel Vicento 's
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-ray images of writers he has met in his literary life (and in some cases, in everyday life) in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in dreaded and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent spares no distractions or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading experience, even with repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
I have found in the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of counter-fate, a morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.
Of Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, the allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not of intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humour, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
Graham Greene said, “Our man has been clothed with passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation.”
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8,000-meter peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
On his own, he said he was the heir to a landowner in the county, sometimes the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the mad cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the XX century in its literary form, running away from himself and crying out for the future and speaking violently to the worms."
Dorothy Parker once kneeled down and prayed, “God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.”
Of Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were inscribed Spenser's verses: 'After the effort comes a dream,/ After the storm a quiet harbor,/ After the war a rest,/ After a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly."
Pío Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos want but to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What was Benet up to but to have Baroja executed with Faulkner's gun?
What else could Cela have done but become famous at the expense of that man's fame?"
Cowardly Aggression
Last week my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by, and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was kicked twice without a word and severely injured.
Our indignation is all the greater because we do not see anything amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on a leash.
Moreover, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon-possessed person, who attacks an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old person or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest Commissioners, but we doubt that it was of any use and, in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Indignation has caused us to report this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they entertain themselves by tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We don't understand what happened to good manners, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only means by which head injuries or deaths can be avoided in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of its commitment to transport safety, which “means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products”, and has confirmed that it seeks to achieve this purpose in other ways, i.e. through an instructional and informational campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', is the first stage in which more than 500 motorcycle repair shops will be put up with signs to bring it to the attention of the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety “is a constant problem” for the company, which is a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to constantly improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November saw an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam sellers.
However, a favorable figure is better to put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a significantly bad period for comparison and meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
As of January, 95,853 vehicles were sold, which includes all possible light commercial vehicle categories: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the gloom that is most damaging to demand has not disappeared, even though it was bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in almost 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors need to be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the bank credit source, such as the cessation of activities or the continuation of a bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is also necessary to mention persons doing business on the trade license of a small and medium-sized company who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded again that it is necessary to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Dealers Association expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will fall by 19%.
Auxiliary system for handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system, it will also be with ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the others are subject to a deadline of February 2011.
The measures put in place in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, while working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver steps down.
However, it is not always possible to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not brake before a collision, and half of them did not fully use the force of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be avoided annually.
The reduction in this number will be even more noticeable - according to calculations would avoid one in four accidents affecting people - after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver responds, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even when a collision cannot be avoided, the device will hit the brake as hard as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones Opel plan until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on April 8 - as Javier Ortega reported, the US manufacturer is warning that it will need more time to meet the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new president, is pushing for every point of the plan to be agreed with the party involved first.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries where the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken these days.
Not surprisingly, the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to take a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer, Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains in force if it is not sold.
Driving a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight only shows 1,275 kg.
Based on this, in the first place, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas version with manual control, reducing the weight by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminium doors such as the GT3 were used, which means an additional 15 kg less; removing the air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to reducing the weight by an additional 7 kg; after mounting the sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19-inch
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means an additional six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle was tested with a manual six-speed gearbox, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many intricate turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Reducing the weight does not mean that the vehicle does not press on the asphalt.
Quite the contrary: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also carry such safety during cornering, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete able to warm up his muscles on a short ride for as long as necessary, until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume engine use...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as it is accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The 320 horsepower V6 boxer sound (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used with the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether suction or recuperation.
Curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary while driving; and in some corners we encountered frost and gravel even in the late morning at dawn.
Definitely, this ultralight car is one of the most entertaining on the market, as it is little more than a mere modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, Coco Cocoon icon and occasional 'starlette' at the 'company' shows, the singer shows off her evil girl face as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins in Israel
She gained a brilliant win in 82-91 on her loan on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus came to the head of her group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of effort and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end in order to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started with a face for the Blues, who stood on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicating that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava squad opted for the internal Baraca game and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by whistles and applause as they returned to their original assignment to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to prove to be the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in the Splitter rating already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was fierce until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Elías' they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to bringing the 'yellow' back to the limelight (50-49).
More Inappropriate
The Ivanovics, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and at the same time the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which three times almost in a row and with the help of Englishe and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring number (54-67), reaching the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavians wiped their skins in the last part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of their deserved results for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from a line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with the Splitter voted out for the foul, the seIvanovics did not hurry and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos, leaving him the lead of Group B in the Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) that facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga squad was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor of its rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, lit up the pitch with a 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although an arsenal of locals in the inner game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the USABeverley and Williams backs meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja squad
Between the indoor players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points they increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
The Impossible Retribution
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to make up the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the group's lead.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the drawbacks, Unicaja, thanks to the lead and triple points Cook and the benefit of Lewis, left some hope of winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved that he was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalizebasket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over to the management of the Olympiacos.

Within a week of the app working, the search engine found that a Spanish worker generally “feels poorly rewarded,” Albert Rivera, in charge of the Trovit product, explained in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31.059, while the Spaniard receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid waiter's job in Spain is with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs in the last three months are driver, part-time job and social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his term officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also quoted a former statesman as confirming his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the government was trying to impose on him "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has resurfaced in the markets, which should come as no surprise, as it is already a natural state of affairs in an environment where executives are making decisions about a future that is in itself uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilize the market was debt monetization by buying assets directly and indirectly releasing liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets for deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are practically over, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policies, they are starting to throw a little sand into the wheel, as the Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the world economy’s ability to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return of risk-reduction returns.
Stock exchange volatility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, quality is being pushed, and the US, Japan, and Germany have become investor-chosen havens, widening the differentiation of eurozone countries vis-a-vis Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but Standard & Poor's came along at that time and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification downgrade.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for silencing moral risk advocates who have once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to hold back the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment, when in fact a new day of thanksgiving would be called for.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections, and a new government is coming.
Prodi did this in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Dur?o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
But what makes sense is for Ecofin to force the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to joint responsibility in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in supported positions they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe’s differences are reduced and ours continue to widen, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 ascension scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not bode well for the Spanish economy to live up to that warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now, "carefully, mate driver".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday before a subcommittee of the House of Commons, where he is debating Spain’s energy strategies for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villaseca, Galán provided the press with several remarks about the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
Iberdrolo said Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and another 60,000 million euros by 2030 if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are preserved.
If this is not the case, the required investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue will change and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the government’s just passed bill on the sustainable economy is in line with the line demanded by the company, did not want to bleed like a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, a "clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite the "accurate" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must be taken now because their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s land-based subsidiary, Swissport, will play the role of Aer Lingus’ preferred partner for cargo services at the ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Castile-La Mancha Junta and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation on the creation of the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre yesterday.
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will be Ferrovial.
One of the Centre’s tasks will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first highway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water utility.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in that country as a construction and concession highway venture.
City Hall hopes to have the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP by initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan under Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
The bids are expected to be submitted in the month of May, and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the final phase three groups with a significant presence in European construction are competing.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second based in Italy is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Northern Direct, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues, is in the game against Acciona.
The third and last group to pass the sieve is LBRJV, which is owned by Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented by ACS), as well as local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major company specialising in civil construction, Razel.
Australia’s infrastructure market promises major construction and privatizations, but there is a clear difficulty in entering in any way other than through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired its market position through its 30 % share in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of businesses that build and manage a 700 million dollar desalination plant in Adelaide.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway from Toowong with a circular route at Kelvin Grove (see map) in the length of 5 kilometers of the tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce the congestion of Brisbane.
The calendar set by the local administration is planned for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the works is planned for 2016.
The tunnel was started in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia continues to bring Hochtief a significant profit, as it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
Through its local branch, Leighton, ACS will make the national broadband infrastructure with fiber-optic cable operational.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet to 400,000 people and will provide the work of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-story King George Tower project in Brisbane, Australia, with construction work yet to begin and Hochtief closing the sale at $129 million.
In the UK, specifically inManchester, it will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
The FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine subsidiary, the FCC has been awarded a 2.1-kilometre tunnel allocation for a motorway in Slovenia worth 64.5 million euros.
The company was awarded the contract a few days after work was completed to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services for the last two years to Sra. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, the company operating the railway said.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented themselves in the audition announced by Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing campaigns.
France fines Télécom $63 million for hindering competition
France’s competition regulator has fined lFrance Télécom 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean regions.
According to the institution, the operator limited competition for fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has bought up more than 560 million euros of fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition watchdog considered that France Télécom had committed a similar offence as in the past and that there had therefore been a relapse.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an application store on the Internet to increase revenue that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, Orange will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barca since the beginning of the year.
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the point that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since made $476.4 million, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The charter is headed by Manchester United.
The charter is headed by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn’t just bring fame; it’s also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros among the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) that have participated in this event since the inception of the 1992/1993 tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out very well from this split.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the top prize three times.
The current champion of Catalonia and the last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the last Champions League.
She lost both of them to Barca.
Spain, on the other hand, is the third country to earn the most money through Champions, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distributions
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will donate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million just for their presence, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There is also a prize bonus (800,000 euros) and a draw (400,000 per team). Eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter finalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get $4 million.
The champion earns $9 million, while the runner-up earns $5.2 million.
In this way, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barca won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has published details of an offer to buy shares in order to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which it would pay in ten years, and for which it would pay interest for this deferment1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed trading at 1.85 euros; thus, Nueva Rumasa’s offer ranks the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 board members.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, despite Ruiz Mateose's confirmation that it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would be $611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is $254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change its leadership structure.
As an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial swings of its former leaders, the Jesús and Jaime Salazar brothers, it was announced the election of María Luisa Jorda as Head of Internal Audit.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in a food business.
This is a newly created post that will be under the direct authority of the group president.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the business continues to be immersed in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers' companies.
De facto, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds cannot be shredded
Regarding the Salazars' credit, former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) testified yesterday in the National Court, confirming that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises Paterna's exclusion option in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion, in which Inversora Mer participates, against Federico Paternin on October 9.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that there is "sufficient" content to explain the brochure submitted following the modifications introduced on 2 December.
CNMV stated that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paterna at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is made up of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilised, which could not be transferred in any way until an offer was made specifying that the price had been set by Federico Paternina according to the provisions of the applicable norms.
New tools for car valuation
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car repair shops earn money.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance claim are towed to a repair shop where an expert must estimate the damage and cost of repair.
No insured event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculate manually the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Service providers and claims and maintenance estimation solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer a useful tool to their customers.
In Spain Audatex, from the American Solera Group is the leading company; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses start working.
This is a very frenzied job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "stick out" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week, if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
They exceed 99% of the rolling stock in circulation.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each specializing in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in the development of these databases.
2.5 million data are added every month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information allows businesses to make different uses and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of a car, depending on the country.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Taking into account the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard event valuation solution designed for connoisseurs.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment that came out of the assembly line, based only on the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to disable vehicles with an overall insurance claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying tendencies, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand have undergone service due to an accident, or how many have suffered serious insured events over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells the Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs, as well as providing digital images, access to parts or prices, and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company founded in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of cars.
Gt Guía valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The volume of turnover has increased by 20% per year over the last three years, accounting for EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established itself in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its brother's creation is in Europe, and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 servicing companies, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
The global invoicing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group cost $1,000 million on the stock exchange, and now its shares are estimated to total $2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera bought Autoonline, an internet base for selling cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance claim.
The operation anticipated a subscription of 59.5 million euros out of 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, repair shops, spare parts sales and professional dealers, who must register before the start of operations.
Founded in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been decommissioned cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles of historic value may be permitted to operate, although they have been phased out, after pre-trial driving.
Service budget in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex ensures that the user gets the budget in just four steps: vehicle identification, spare part search, budget creation and budget generation.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who are more or less reluctant to use new driving techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an Internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical display of the model appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor cost, surcharges or discounts, and then print and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make these impressions three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it allows them, for example, to select a door and rotate it to show the inside.
