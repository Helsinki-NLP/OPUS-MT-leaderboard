Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried that they will “look like the Muppets”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are appalled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of rallies across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could make a mockery.
One Labour Party member said his group is concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means dumb and pwp means poop.
Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was moving to change the name "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP is close to the Muppet word.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: "The final decision on what the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will of course be up to the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where the variant of calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament received widespread support.
As for the title of Assembly members, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are clearly proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus may bring worries to President Elin Jones, who is due to present a draft legislation in a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules for disqualifying members and a draft committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
A popular vote is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country's applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change referendum, said he would not follow the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's keep quiet as churches in Harlem struggle to survive
“The old people I’ve talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There is none today.”
The disappearance of the bar is understandable.
“People see each other differently these days,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of a neighborhood where people go regularly.”
As for churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining tabernacles in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and that’s why the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it’s unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black congregation whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was at the forefront of a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a chimes.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the chimes “bells of the poor.”
An expert who played the glockenspiel in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first glockenspiel in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger glockenspiel at a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says there was no replacement at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin has been the site of a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom were called by lay representatives of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Council of Elders, the governing body of the parish consisting of lay representatives, sent a letter to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to pass on the costs" to the council of elders, although the latter did not participate in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Diving for Lobsters in California
According to an official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday who was diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he overheard the boy calling for help and then paddled to him with the entire group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel stated that he at first considered the call to be the joy of catching a lobster, but then “realized that he was screaming ‘bite me!
He bit me!”
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that "he had torn the whole area of the clavicle."
“I shouted for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Council Children's Hospital in San Diego in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Capt. Larry Giles, a lifeguard, told a news conference that the shark had been spotted in the area weeks ago, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas due to investigation and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s wants to challenge Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with store-style beauty aisles that will feature dedicated shop assistants.
With a strong launch in the UK, worth 2.8 billion pounds and continuing to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods are declining, cosmetics aisles will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to other stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to efforts by supermarkets to find uses for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwave ovens, and household items.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products and will launch brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space thanks to branded places similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range, so most of the products will be vegan, something that young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will be testing the franchises of Fragrance Shop, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and another this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the shift towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local shops means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount sellers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of Argos stores and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are the chains it bought two years ago. As a result, food sales have increased and acquisitions are even more profitable.
A previous attempt by the supermarket to redesign the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s was testing a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the sale of medicines in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds plans to play its part by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Sainsbury’s sales director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetic aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues that our customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should cater to all needs and the enticing environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that are changing old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby walked out of a contract for ?11 million
Dragons Day star Peter Jones is "furious" after TV host Holly Willoughby walked out of an $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of Truly homewear and accessories.
The pair's business has been compared to that of Goop actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old broadcaster announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby enraged Dragons Den star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was “furious” when a TV star admitted during a tense Tuesday meeting at his business empire’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that because of the new contracts - worth up to ?1.5 million - he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of True homewear and accessories.
The business was compared to Goop's Gwyneth Paltrow brand and could double Willoughby's fortune at an estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones set off from the UK to one of her summer residences.
The source said: “Truly was a top priority for Holly.
It was to be her long-term future that would secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to a hefty investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and a possible further delay in the launch of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Jones joined as chairman in March.
The pair go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador, replacing Ant McPartlin on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult Acts “And Then We Fell in Love”
He joked about criticism he gets from journalists for a remark some consider “unworthy of a president” and for how he speaks positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with a mocking "proclamation" voice.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that after Trump hailed their June first meeting in Singapore as a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But negotiations for the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “responsive response” from the US to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. is pursuing sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing on relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 outsiders trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been driven from their homes, a national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung says.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Paul to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes happen very often in Indonesia, the country is still woefully unprepared for Mother Nature’s wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not common on other parts of the coast.
An apparent shortage of sirens warning of a tsunami in Paul probably contributed to the loss of human lives, even when a warning was issued.
Even at the best of times, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
The hospital ship that docked in Lombok and helped the earthquake victims is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was the main focus of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding shortfalls.
President Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with Muslim majority members adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scores against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres in front of the Chelsea gate when his team lost 1-0.
He threw the ball to his left and fired to a distant stick.
The shot flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually skipped the jumping Kepu Arrizabalagu and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming towards me, so I didn’t think about it much and he shot at one touch.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard's goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball.
He then sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in the lime.
He escaped defensively and ended up left-handed to a distant pole next to Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will face the local team in a Champions League group match at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had climbed to 832.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, triggering waves as high as 6 meters and trapping many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, the office's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Paulu, which has a population of over 380,000, was littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 am on Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “The investigation is only just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation is underway and they are now informing the victims' relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, was trying to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will be several hours before they can return home.
One person was told by a police officer that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
He kept saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape, and another was waiting outside.
There are a number of police officers in the area who are monitoring the house.
Anyone who has any information can send a message to MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and enter the September 30th code 247.
The Cromwell statue in parliament has become a hit recently due to an argument over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolish" and "an effort to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was essential that Oliver Cromwell’s character be one of the targets.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, written by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to 19th-century opinion and part of the character's historiography that many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people regard Cromwell, though slightly less today than at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killer pig tore apart a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southeast China.
As reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a pigeon market in Liupanshui province.
The pig farmer is preparing to give the vaccine to pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly arrived Wednesday with a cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the door to the next sty open.
According to him, there was a big pig in the barn with a bloody mouth.
According to the information, a forensic examination confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig tore the farmer.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn," Guiyang Evening News quoted his cousin, whom he calls by the surname "Wu."
The security camera footage shows Yuan arriving on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The marketplace's administrator told the Evening News that the pig was closed so no one else would think of it when police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family over compensation for his death.
While attacks by pigs on humans are rare, they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured the man.
A decade earlier, a 300kg pig had pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and driven away by the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa debris will bring heavy rain to the southwest US
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Rosa reached wind speed of 137 km/h, representing a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure furrow is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture northward into the southwest U.S.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity will trigger heavy rains in the southwest of the US in the coming days as the low pressure furrow approaches.
Precipitation of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous flash floods, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour in places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the U.S., especially over most of Arizona, between 50 and 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Under rapidly deteriorating conditions, torrential flooding may occur due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Because of the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local gust winds and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure furrow will bring heavy local precipitation to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, rare tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona, and rain will spread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
We can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. in October as the Arctic begins to cool, but it will still be quite warm in the tropical zone.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the USA on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, the difference is nearly 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few today will try again to expand the lingering summer heat.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to warm early October with temperatures around 27°C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern U.S.
In New York City, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interview was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday the eye-catching testimony of Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stalemate continued, and newscasters interrupted routine programs with reports of a sudden turnaround on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was groping her drunk at a high school party and trying to strip her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in a statement that he was 100% sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the event, according to Nielsen.
The company counted average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers for the other stations that aired the testimonies, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching in the office.
By comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest viewership of all the stations, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued after the meeting.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him shouting at protesters as he was about to ride the elevator to a court hearing Friday morning.
CNN broadcast live how he stood for several minutes with his eyes down and let himself be scolded.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think the country is telling the truth?”
He also heard: “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement, adding that he would say more at the commission meeting before closing the elevator door.
All cable and television networks later aired live when the Judicial Commission was to vote on submitting Kavanaugh's nomination for a vote to the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'politics' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “politicizing” about Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was close to that with the Prime Minister on the front page, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's tariffs was "absolutely pointless".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dytheon Simpson, who is suspected of killing LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to CBS's WABF channel, police secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson admitted after questioning that he had shot Wayde.
According to the defense attorney, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for "drinking and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU,
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that Wayde's death "shaked" the team and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on Mexico City
Ashes pouring down from the volcano Popacatépetl hit the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a series of thunderstorms and tremors.
Images of car windshields covered with a thin layer of ash have appeared on social media in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a magnitude of 7.1.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands engaged in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the independence vote, which was split by Catalonia.
The riot police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, clashes broke out, which the police had to use truncheons to calm down.
Within hours, independence supporters chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of the union’s protestors who shouted “Long live Spain.”
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low as opponents of secession boycotted them.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to end voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Independence support groups stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Narcissus Termes, an 86-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are at an impasse," he said.
Despite an important, albeit close, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence-supporting parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders have either gone into exile themselves or are waiting in court for their part in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old assembler, Joan Puig, recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone, saying that the conflict had been fomented by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidates in European elections are the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men trapped after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing their car into a house in Londonderry.
The event happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 pm local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the house itself were damaged.
At one point, someone may have fired a crossbow at the car.

Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and only gave Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as the club's manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership this season and will face the first Hearts to lose eight points next Sunday.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has expanded the division to six games without losing, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has yet to experience a defeat.
Livingston didn't take chances against lackluster guests
Holt's team should have been leading long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed at the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the slip just missed Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
The home team could just watch the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could be upsetting the guests with standard situations.
Then came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers, and Livingston formed a loophole, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sending Menga, who the ball in the middle of the penalty area to dot and score.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but home defense was impenetrable to them and goalie Liam Kelly was usually not very busy.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to hit.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow missed out on Livingston's next standard situation.
Centers were constantly flying into Livingston's penalty area as players cleaned up, and two penalty kicks came in vain - after Halkett's attack on alternate Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
"Phenomenon" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has roused the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was tremendous, leading a superbly organized defense, while Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby at all times.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't meet those standards anymore.
Their ending was poor - they only made it to the home side once - and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's admission to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
Turkey has the largest population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the neighborhood who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people, many of them Kurds, were heard protesting Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect the controversy of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some German Turks, and cursed as an autocrat by others.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford to the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance soon arrived, but the man was dead at the scene.
The death came just months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in the riots at the men's high-security prison.
The riots erupted at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized guards from the Tornado team were called in to handle the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison personnel were deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison's director had ended up in the hospital following the inmate's attack.
And last October, riot squads were called to the prison due to serious riots in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (areas where droughts may benefit)
It’s not common for a tropical low-pressure furrow to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest and carries the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including cities like Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane still 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona at points of up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local totals up to 100 mm.
For those who are not in danger of flooding, dew rain can be a blessing as the area has been hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but maybe it will help somewhere, because the southwestern United States has just been hit by a drought.
Weather.com reports that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least “extreme drought,” the second-highest category.
The path of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still hurricane-force with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico on Sunday morning and will move at 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be strong, posing a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 75 to 150 mm of precipitation is expected in the area from Baja California to northwest Sonor, and may occur as high as 250 mm," weather.com said.
Rosa then travels like a tropical storm through Mexico to the north and arrives at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, then passes through Arizona and enters southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main risk for Rosa or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the US," the National Hurricane Center reports.
These rains are expected to cause deadly torrential flooding and torrential debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now “stable”.
According to police from Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who could have a record of what happened on their cell phones.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'has tasted the wickedness and rage' of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the Democratic Party’s reckless and scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the wickedness and rage" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he flatly and emotionally rejected allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing regarding her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans were witnesses to Kavanaugh’s excellence and quality and courage.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that “the voice affirming Judge Kavanaugh is a testament to one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has accomplished public service.”
The president indirectly alluded to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it was for Republicans to participate in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m still on the move,” he said.
“That’s why I fight for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
An adviser to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate floor is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds in Indonesia and death toll continues to rise
Authorities said Saturday that after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of them swept away by the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu on Friday, but by nightfall, waves of up to six meters hit the coast, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was preceded by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people still continued their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they fell victim to the waves,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not go alone, it took with it cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami wave was spreading on the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
He stated that some people fled the wave into the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's strong tremors was approximately 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami even bigger.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found wedged under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho informed that the amount of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was “totally crippled without any information” from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday because it did not report that Palu had been hit by a tsunami wave, although authorities said the waves had arrived around the time the warning was issued.
In the amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building can be heard desperately shouting to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the coast is hit by a wall of water that carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the report immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Pal, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
According to authorities, the military began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transport assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has climbed to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala came to the city of Paulu, where employees hide in shelters made of cells built in the yard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups started the sad activity of disaster relief, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can start flowing to the site only after a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a province-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not the state of affairs yet.”
When the second night came in Paul after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be those miracles that lighten the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Another of the people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional baggage,” she says.
Mr Gendon recounted how in the hours that followed the paragliding community learned of the Roa Roa hotel crash, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants from Palo who were attending a beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money in it.
While doing so, another man “runs out from behind a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money that was supposed to be put into an ATM.
According to a press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If possible, contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, "A being formally known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled due to "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
West has previously said that the word for him has a religious meaning in addition to shortening the current professional name.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, speaking about his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It changed from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye - as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are,"
Many other famous rappers changed their names.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
Former West collaborator Jay-Z also wrote his name alternately with and without a hyphen, in both upper and lower case.
Mexico's AMLO president vows not to use military force against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
As leftist student movements spread throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who are studying, and by opening more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government published AI announcements, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, last year implemented a plan to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further away than the US and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the best American player in Othello, and later was a senior Microsoft research officer and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“Academic leaders are not being taken away by China, but by corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed the best experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Changes in immigration policy could also help improve AI efforts, Lee said.
“In my opinion, AI PhD holders should automatically be offered green cards,” he says.
The State Council of China released a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is poorer in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence this year to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of an AI Select Committee.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
But the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments struck a deal in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised questions about whether at least 50 percent of voters will turn out to be needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries to the former Yugoslavia, to join organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems were reported until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters finally cast their vote.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls up chairs in front of tents erected by people who boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not the door for the servants,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
A “yes” would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could take part in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one voter must participate.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it took office last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has scored a goal across Brighton's defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling settled Brighton's defense on Saturday, securing Manchester City a 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera’s presentation, his goal in the 65th minute seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine striker received in the middle of the field.
He prosprinted between the three Brighton defenders and made it into the open.
Aguera then surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, he bypassed one defender and overtook several others.
The following pass to the left found Sterling.
An English striker knocked the ball back in the penalty area to Aguero, who right-handedly overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by shooting into the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to score a goal at the time.”
However, the initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was arranged by Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on his left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a remote pole.
Attacker Sky Blues dropped the ball into the net just before it slid off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to re-enter.
But the eternally competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitcher's place on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies - but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have hope for a playoff.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night by winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Even if we’re not playing anything, we can at least play a game, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the other team will play with probably the most effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start Sunday, but are reportedly leaning toward pitching Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be his 34th start, training on Thursday and pitching on Sunday, when he usually has the day off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has an 18-7 statistic this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The president made an indirect comment on the situation surrounding his Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to take part in mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done will be at stake.
There are five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
"It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but we're still on the move and I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the loathsomeness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, have opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he added, saying that Democrats are "angry and evil and loathsome and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud booing of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring the document?
Uh, what?
No, er, no, wait -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of opinion.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momento activists in my local party voted for my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome - because they have honestly given their opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar matters on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
For most of the eight years I was a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place these days, and the promise of a “kinder, kinder” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that divergent views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged to be acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues I once thought had similar political views suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and hold positions that I otherwise could not agree with, whether national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there is a tirade of swearing on social media, calling for my dismissal, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments directed at me are usually political.
I respect the professionalism and commitment of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with every motion of censure or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
Over the past two years, I’ve been advised many times to hold back, not to speak up so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which has literally disintegrated my general-school class, I have been struggling to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised at my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only say that as the country struggles towards Brexit, which will damage households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
The two late fives somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they're at the top of the board, the only ones undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances that helped the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through a lot in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, “Congratulations Ayr, they took a chance better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, turned by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority, and Jason Baggot earned an unconverted five.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty and then scored at exactly halftime and turned the solo attempt, so adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's five, turned by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
This was followed by a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the pitch on a stretcher, and when the game started again, Ayr jumped again thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, turned by Climo.
Acting captain Ayru Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the extra player thanks to Bruce Colvin's unconverted five after a brief strong pressure.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got yellow for attacking Clim without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty line-up put the ball behind the advancing maul of Ayr.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught a kick from David Armstrong and sent a winger to Gregor Henry for a fifth home run.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes and stars in with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the series, and it appears Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish Sun source suggested Kiernan wanted to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia hopes court will reopen road to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
A blue ocean flag flies over public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described with the slogan: “The sea is rightfully ours.
Getting it is our duty.”
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast the country lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century war for resources - as well as the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations are perhaps the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which is expected to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm and of course expects a positive result,” Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will watch the MSD's decisions on big screens across the country with the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate that it will grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election battle next year - is also keen on Monday's decision.
“We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia's favor - and even if it did, not much would change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to award Chilean territory to anyone, and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICD’s decision comes just six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case “wasn’t complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only failed to support the Bolivian cause, they may have slowed it down.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government,” says Zarate.
He adds that Morales' offensive rhetoric has weakened any remaining goodwill for Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will start acting again one day, but after this it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - used the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the pledges made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has stalled for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "hopeful" that continued sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge headwear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of wacky giant headwear for their 2019 spring/summer collections at the show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their exciting creations to the catwalks.
The exhibition piece by Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide feather-like edge that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories were garnished melons, a witch's hat, and even pineapple - but they are not meant to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the brightly colored masks have stitched lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One design resembled diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion - you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could also arrive in fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw hat with a six-foot-wide brim, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another huge creation to the catwalks - a straw beach bag that's almost as big as the swimsuit model carrying it.
A dark orange rafi bag lined with rafi fringes and fitted with a white leather handle was a piece of the 2019 La Riviera spring/summer collection by Jacquemus at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer - given that the designer has had so much success with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent exam results. Individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and working to ensure the best possible level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their pupils for further and higher education, the careers they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement individually tailored school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and in demand subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that languages are at the top of the charts, with independent schools having the highest success rates.
A total of 68 percent of pupils who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students achieved the highest A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by pupils are as important in the study plans of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of job vacancies are under-skilled.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalised world.
Whichever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have the real advantage of having such a lifelong skill in the future.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them failed to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people, namely 15 percent, being French.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of emerging economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school is different in the languages it teaches.
A number of schools are focusing on more classic modern languages, while others are teaching languages considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are vital to the country’s future in the global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will play the Lakers for the first time in San Diego on Sunday
Fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time will soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's opening game of the preseason at San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after practice, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Due to the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump’s show start tonight, and how can you watch him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which was very tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed by a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans pick up the pace before the November election.
Campaign organizers say the five rallies next week are aimed at “giving energy to volunteers and supporters so Republicans can try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“The control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania" could come to today's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and be watched by the media from Pittsburgh.
It will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, scoring more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican nominee Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Its Stomach to Fight to Keep Hope Ahead of Sunday's Singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday’s pairings may be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really trust it, and most of all at such competitions.
So where does the pendulum swing now?
“They scored six points and now it’s four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little bit towards us,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of leading by four points, and there are still twelve of them left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their sails, and there are many things that can cheer them up, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal in the transition from tee to green and sets an example.
Glorious screams intensified in the continuation of his round, when he managed a key stalemate to win the whole match, when he and Tomas were two holes behind.
His putt, which won them a match on 15 holes, has encountered a similar roar telling you that the American team is not out yet.
“You really had to go deep and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that each player has left.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, indisputably the main story of the Ryder cup.
A strange but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit a hole on Saturday afternoon, but also missed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning.
The course and the way the energy flows both towards and from the stormy audience confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that by sundown over Le Golf Naitional he won’t be a more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time on a different hole.
Talk of European glory, however, remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game of four balls, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in an abyss from which they had not climbed.
No one will help you on Sunday.
Two-to-two ball games are so fascinating when you’re closely following people-to-couple interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give themselves, and the way that strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead to the last day, but this two-team game has also shown that the US team has the stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
Europe leads Ryder Cup final day with 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup, after which they came out of Saturday's doubles games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly almost won twice over the struggling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four notches at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they had lost at Hazeltine, dominated in the morning's two-ball games with the American side failing in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, winning two games, but could not get into deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were given the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they easily beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5&4.
Woods, who stretched out two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in a pair on two balls and seven in a row.
Rested after a morning two-ball game, Justin Rose returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 match to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris won all the way.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They earned a rough 2&1 win over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to beat pair Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pair game despite losing the two first holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup does the team return from a four-point deficit to a singles game, though as defending Furyk's side it only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After being the next day's best for two days, it seems there's a Sunday counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” disarm unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued UN sanctions had deepened their distrust of the United States and under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
“We don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is impossible to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step taken, his statements appeared significant in that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged guarantees of North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-1953 war conflict, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to enforce their targets, and even objects to a ‘declaration of end of war,’” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the US were on the sidelines of this denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standoff.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s targeting of U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. Bad President” Trump branded Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations last year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work must be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have the time frame to do so, saying: “If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and unceasingly until we recognize a complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly party, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made only for North Korea to declare within hours that it was making "gangster demands."
North Korea has pledged to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he hoped for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course designed to teach them how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has forced all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of macho study all night long, when students do not sleep and encourage themselves with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most renowned university are often baffled when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to implement the course after finding that the students were seriously sleepless during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of student dormitories where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Getting enough good quality sleep should be the student’s “secret weapon” for fighting stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, leaving one still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course one of his classes took during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the whole course.
It hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can upset your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss as they hit Dolly Menga confirming Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side tried to record their first win from February 4 to February 1 of a triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted a second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games as manager to leave their post eight points away from the leading leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers line-up seemed uninspired and determined to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and just behind the Hibernian team on a one-wicket difference.
And there could be other Rangers issues after the line umpire Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side which swept past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up a Hearts point last week, and would have been pleased with how his well-trained team was choking their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were due to score just two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman on goal by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' far-flung free kick was then found by captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the back post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty for a quarter-hour lead when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by a header from Lassana Coulibaly and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener after 34 minutes could have been against running the game, no one can deny that they deserved it already for the hard work.
Rangers again failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and picked up Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing plunged into Morelos, but the formidable Kelly made it off the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game exactly the kind they love, with Lithgow and Halkett metaling one long ball after another.
Holt's side could widen their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran off the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another belated penalty claim when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our “Sunday Morning” almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years old today, and counting... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter also became a fixture of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in God's name is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of radioactive atoms in minerals.
Evans: “Yeah, it’s really cracking right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein that is common to many cancers, and then rivet injected again
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, transforming them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be re-injected into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “controls the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, where immune cells were taken from patients and "taught" them to target cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, in his maga cap, following his performance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live after a confused performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began spitting at Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I hated racism, I wouldn’t be in America anymore,” he said.
SNL opened the show with a parody of Matt Damon starring the Hollywood star making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the rape allegations of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speaking was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West.
West also complained to viewers that he got his head adornment well eaten backstage.
“I was bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see the wrong place?", adding that he would "put on his Superman suit because it means you can't tell what to do."
Try the love.”
His comments earned only the buzzing of the audience at least twice, and the SNL members seemed outraged, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, "The whole studio has gone completely silent."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA’s leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU for positioning Dave.”
But guest talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I don’t want to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or promoting their ‘art’) that I believe represents and sends an ideology out into the world that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges filed will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington embarked on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
However, the actor, 31, stepped out of the macho hero stereotype and said that such roles on the screen meant that young boys often felt they had to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes “something is wrong” and asked how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is “quite strongly” on the issue.
"At the moment, I personally feel, quite strongly - what happened so bad with masculinity?" he said.
“What are we teaching teenage men about the problem we’re seeing right now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, that makes them feel the need for every man to have such a side?
I think this is really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because I'm sure young men have changed for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after completing the series, as he has had enough of "fights and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the restored True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set of the show, so she gave me my future family and my entire life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by the virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000 people year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from a lack of sexual protection during these intercourses.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senators' data, slams "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced claims that a member of her staff sent personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wikis.
A Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were backed by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during Senate hearings on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that sources posts is associated with the Waters office and has published information about Waters staff members, Hill says.
“This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
They need to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom they criticized because he seemed too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement authorities to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified," she continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - A Weaker Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British tendency, which seems to be the case with this resurgence of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this sassy satire on how obviously a bad nation we are be our new export opportunity?
In any case, this bulging, rubber-faced Johnny English had his license to mess things up again in a whole new way - that name more than anything else as a signal that there was a broad comic production designed for a non-English speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the dull secret agent who, despite his bizarre demands for a smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a big chunk of the guy who sang a single tone in the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man who Atkinson once played in already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and who left a trail of chaos behind.
In this latest edition, there are one or two good moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly dinged about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite underpowered and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it’s meant for children than adults, and to me Johnny English’s crazy travails are as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie gags in Mr. Bean’s persona.
The current assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, much to the dismay of the agent on duty - an all-too-small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and biased character who is already suffering under the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays this would-be Theresa May character best, but there isn't much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every one of her active spies is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
That means Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some fancy facility, but at the same time gives record-breaking lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, as English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering partner Bough, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affective figure who may even be a bit of a waste with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister succumbs dangerously to the charms of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of farcical banter: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak aboard Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of Volt's house using virtual reality.
All the aces are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something from the children's TV in it.
Quite a moderate affair.
And as with all of Johnny English’s films, I couldn’t help but think: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for the English to work four days a week and get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is due to consider a radical plan in which Britons will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to hand over to the workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but would still take the same reward.
Sources say the idea would "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day work week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The assessment of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a wish that fits the party’s stance on balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not our party's policy and the party does not take it into account".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a labor conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to bring back the energy of “anonymous CEOs” and “experts” in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their overall stake, as the Labour government could make "collision" on the basis of perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create equity funds that will hand over 10% of private enterprise equity to employees who are entitled to an annual dividend payment of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation might have changed their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the office's findings could sway any Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In a "60 Minutes" interview on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal."
Graham's decision, however, is unshakeable.
"I've already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh and that would be a really explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The 7th edition of the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group in support of ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will make a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing more than $37 billion in commitments and actions to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its operations, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that hedged funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential”, promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events calling for U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizenn responded: “It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year’s New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy for ‘Blockade’ to Prevent Russian Energy Exports
Washington can resort to the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to channel energy, just like they are in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to make sure that the shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their energy is not going to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is seen as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less an investment in or replacement of fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “single-purpose” player with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump says has made Berlin a “hostage” to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to ‘take a close look’ at 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "close look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position," she said.
"After November 6th, I'll be taking a close look at the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting, saying she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in the context of a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he will make his decision officially in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Tracka Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through on his return, may involve other families feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back tempered, they come back asking if there's any respect at all for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, is giving to their country.
He was arrested Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence, and possessing a gun while drunk, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal appeal for new measures by the U.S. government that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and a district in Washington issued a briefing on Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the Civil Liberties Organization of America against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of a violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys for states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 appeals panel decision for immigrants that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the short friend said.
Lawyers also briefly argued that policies that deny immigrants entry hurt the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum has never had the goal of alleviating all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palo, where the death toll has already doubled, race to find survivors against the clock
The situation was getting worse and worse for the survivors.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the parched city of Palu.
“An ambulance will bring in more bodies every minute.
Clean water is precious.”
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, choosing through waterlogged things, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that had been destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to the ongoing severe subsequent concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the feeling that a violent earthquake had shaken the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was dragged into the wall ruin," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family were in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with propaganda ads
A week after China’s official daily published a four-page ad in the US daily about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional election on November 6.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war that manifests itself on the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major agricultural goods exporter to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now doubling down on this bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s valuable tradition of free speech and a free press by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newsstand on a street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and see no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic trajectory, given that the media belongs to the “Chinese Communist Party” firm,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Leave Their Voters Ahead of Elections Over Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans advocate for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaug, who faces multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that they will get a response, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this case have been extremely high, and most Republicans on record are already saying they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last-minute efforts to investigate the FBI will be enough to reassure voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not even in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in D.C., said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" at a demonstration in the Senate hallway where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was already high, that's true."
However, it could be higher, especially among hesitating female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29, who may not like the president but don't often go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that resistance might follow if Republicans confirmed.
"It's a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in who to trust in light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunkly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional instruments.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional about personal online storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The purpose of the Inrupt project, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some employees working on the project have collaborated on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a total change where all their business models are flipped upside down overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a media post published on Saturday that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place a hundred years since the only clergyman of the Church of England won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone to him at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "geniusly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and strong fire from field guns and machine guns."
He later got into the front line and with "highest courage" led the line forward before throwing himself into the field of fire on his own and knocking out three detached units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do but at the same time something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid a wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt a great honor to be able to participate in the show", adding that "the valor of a true hero is manifested in the support that a lot of people will provide."
MMA fans stayed all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting a piglet Peppa
Imagine, you've been waiting all night to watch the supercharged Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The account from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their match, viewers in the UK were left in awe as the news turned into a show about Peppa Pig.
Some remained unsettled after keeping awake until the early hours of the morning for the match.
One fan on Twitter described the change in broadcasts to a children's show as "a form of bad joke."
“By government order, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and it is therefore necessary to air children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, after being asked about the broadcast.
"Piglet Peppa," yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said the program will work to engage viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably do it,” Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we can’t make it to Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five games instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we haven't succeeded.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘less valuable’ because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize "they're not all like him" until he entered high school.
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said he was less interested in winning the Olympics because of being a parent.
The regular presenter of the long-term show Kirsty Young had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a castaway on Lavern's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness were real things that gave me the strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “Somebody,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who might find out about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a champion for LGBT rights and has used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke up because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with an American film director, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 “unprepared.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you have so much to experience at such a young age - he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it wasn't easy to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley said his "whole point of view" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would have been all ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medalist is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be on the front lines.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the front row, Dad," he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I'd dreamed of it all my life - jumping in front of our hosts at the Olympic Games, I can't feel better," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first track, "Prodú from Heather Small", which resonated with him at the opening of the Olympics and still made him shiver.

Mickelson, who was out of form, finished on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson would have set a record on Sunday for playing 47 Ryder Cup games, but he would have to tweak his form to prevent it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event every two years for the record for the 12th time, was sent to the bench by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time major winner spent his day alternately between cheerleading and working on a game in a line he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the straightest of drivers, even at the height of his career, making him an ideal choice for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where long rugged terrain routinely punishes stray shots.
And unless the golf course itself is worrying enough, Mickelson faces precision British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth game, winning all four of his matches with rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week.
Had the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped the rapid onset, Mickelson's sword could have proved absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and did nothing else.
“He totally understands the role he played today, pats me on the back, puts his hand around my shoulders and says he’ll be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“They believe so much.
He is a member of the Hall of Straw and in the past this week has been so beneficial for these teams.
I don't think I could have imagined him playing two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup wests played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has achieved 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence on the team has yielded some intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also had fun going to see him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big leadership could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead going into the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they made it to the finish straight with a completely tight win of 141-2-131-2.
“You have to keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, as well as at Brooklin, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only close,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching them win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So history and every member of that team has shown me that it's not over.
Tomorrow you will be bored.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the dots are on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win that trophy and that is what we are focusing on.
I said I would focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what to stand for on the other side - the best players in the world."
Delighted by his players’ performance on the complex golf course, Bjorn added: “I could never have done it alone.
We have another animal tomorrow.
Tomorrow we are going to do individual performances and that is very difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there on your own, your golfer’s capacity is fully vetted.
That’s the message you have to give the players, to get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner behind, and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will make sure his players play better as individuals than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big twists when he was part of the winning team at Brooklin, to then end up a loser when Europe reached the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to head into the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you want to start quickly like you did in Brooklin, like you did in Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield games.
That's how we set the line-up and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
“I went with that group of guys in that order because I think it covers all the way,” Bjorn said of his singles selection.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coastline, local media say.
The commissioning of the lead ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", an all-new Baden-Wuertember-class frigate, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was scheduled to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the rigours of the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project uncomfortable.
The four Baden-Wuerttember-class vessels commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles, and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that top-class naval ships - which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas - will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, notes Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after handover.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of major "software errors and defects on metal elements" defects that would render the warship unusable for use in combat.
Software failures were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttember-class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - half the personnel needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown to have considerable excess weight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future innovation.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects in metal elements, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price has risen to a staggering 3.1 billion euros.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained in importance, especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed "running out of deployable ships."
The official said the problems continued to mount as the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttember-class frigates were capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research is underway at a bat housing estate in the Highlands of Scotland to uncover how bats are using the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities for the conservation of this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will track bats whistling and the smallest and brown long and watery at the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat housing estate to monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings detects the frequency of bat calls and what each species does.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be released, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats, and how individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened as a result of the construction and territorial development that affect the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatments for building materials and cat attacks can also pose a risk.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in hunting prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, colony checks, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threeve housing estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the housing estate, says it is an ideal area for them.
“We have a great area here in Threave for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there's still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive."
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting real estate maintenance work, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to step up and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know about, how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, his lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “wanted to make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the case, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers in a live Instagram video, calling the information “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball award winner to the camera.
“They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I’m happy and I’m fine,” the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to indict the daily Der Spiegel on unfounded charges, which they described as an "unacceptable report of suspicion in a private area".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and a casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the arcade where, according to documentation filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was allegedly raped anally.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her he was a “99 percent” “man” and a “one percent” disappointment.
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of reprisals" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking a retrial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the attack, Ronaldo was a step away from Manchester United’s Real Madrid club and was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros this summer.
Brexit: UK will regret loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Greg Clark, the company’s secretary, said in a statement.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“A deal is necessary,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a delay at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could cost jobs.
At the Auris and Avensis plant in Burnaston, Toyota produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would see production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are fuelling fears of leaving the EU without a deal when it comes to the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW says it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts from suppliers in both the UK and the EU delivered to cars made to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to stock more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus stop production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans to rekindle future relations with the EU were "precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls."
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must absolutely be able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it warns that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the chairman of the union in the race, said that union members are becoming increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these jobs disappear, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
A high-level meeting between Donald Trump and Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “for another week” as the fight for the post of Chief Justice continues with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller's special council, which examines interference in Russia's election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump releases the acting attorney general and thus threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has been gratifying for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "rather" not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were giving testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's full vote once again.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet, it may be this week, we may need to move on to another week, given everything else going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always keep up to date with the media.”
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not due to an aversion to the "theater" of television reporters, although she said "I don't agree with the fact that they are going to speak."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more questions and answers sessions than any president before him,” she added, without providing evidence.
Sanders said: “If the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We've been trying and you've seen that we've been doing this for the last few weeks and there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Health Minister wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and wish that they would stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to settle the costs of requests for settlement status of EU citizens working in converted public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continue to move forward with the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reassure you how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is absolutely your home, and it is our fervent wish that you remain here."
Christion Abercrombie Advances Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tigers' ejected defenseman Christion Abercrombie advanced emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put oxygen on Abercrombie's sideline and then put him on a stretcher to prepare for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had progressed to surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the type/range of injuries" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore in a red shirt, makes his first season for the state of Tennessee after a transfer from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total tackles, meaning a total of 18 tackles in a season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under Tory's new plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move, which aims to attract young voters
The increase in the obligation of higher property taxes will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state treasury is expected to increase by 120 million euros a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will pay higher property tax when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and a focus on high-income people.
The property tax hike will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money will bolster government efforts to fight oversleeping.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the state treasury will increase its funds by up to 120 million euros per year.
Estimates say that 13% of non-UK residents buy newly built properties in London, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get home.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy emerged just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut on property purchases to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to redress the “failure of homes” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an engaging series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending “no-frills” evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “I said last year that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime minister to renewing the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape life here.
But it can’t be right to make it easy for entities that don’t live in Britain and for foreign companies to be able to buy houses just as hard-working UK residents do.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too distant and the disgrace of sleeping without a roof over their head is too real."
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says it is his "highest ambition" to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of resuming the Northeast Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing back the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was given rank B and that was it," Ross said on BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I was successful in the management of the club.”
Ross' predecessors in the role of Sunderland's managers were: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a big club when he had previously turned down overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the time would have been measured by the question of whether I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment at this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to put him back there, but I think I'd be successful if I could just put the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, having previously served as an assistant boss at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third group and transformed St Mirren from incipient decline to champions the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he ever did in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“They were probably real intersections,” Alloa recalls.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was good, making good money and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
I keep going through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but I just have a good feeling in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I do, I feel like I’m the most comfortable in my adult life right now.”

Research finds a great time for a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave increased the incomes of British pubs struggling, but increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, a consulting firm that produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
Bars and pubs have done their best so far, just as restaurants have done their worst.
Pubs whose main sales are from food have also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
“Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell three percent.”
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analytics said: “These results are a continuation of a trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent annual drop in sales will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not be a worse time for food-inviting business operators, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector’s industry sales monitor, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined sales of over 9 billion pounds, an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
One in five children aged just 11 has a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, research shows
Survey of 20,000 high school students shows rise in ‘fake Instagram sites’
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they have a “major” account that their parents know about
One in five children, aged just 11 years, create social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” sharing photos.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a embellished “main” account that their parents know about, while also having a private account.
One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found her teenage girl urging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters Association and the Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting that they keep private accounts.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Voice of Athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most awarded lightweight athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those in charge of sports like those who will benefit from her far-reaching experience internationally over the past decade.
“Eilidh has wide-ranging respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that she will be of considerable benefit to athletics in Scotland if she is a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be a real asset and help lead the sport in Scotland."
An American who won the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, won four gold medals in total and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I recover or to what extent.
It’s exhausting, but I was able to make a full recovery, learn to walk again, and today I’m doing the exercises!
Thanks for all the encouraging news!"
Breast pump that compares mothers to cows divides opinions online
A breast pump company has divided online opinion by advertising that compares nursing mothers to milking cows.
As part of the launch of “the world’s first silent wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Envi has released a music video exaggerating to show the freedom that the new breast pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows to the song with the lyrics: "Yes, I'm impressed, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, I don't have udders, here are my boobs."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, water my dear milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of them saying it sheds light on the dairy industry’s “horror”.
"A very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth in order to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth.”

Another comment: “Comprehensibly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “The ad is completely off.”
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song “contagious.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's to the point.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not advertising to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows them all dancing with discreet breast pumps hidden under their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk report feeling like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and hides beautifully in a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a baby and even walk while sucking.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD for Mothers, commented: “Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a strong and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point out the milk extraction and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new breast pump will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's breast pump has been in the spotlight.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two moms on the catwalk appeared designer Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product just now.
Hundreds of migrant children move quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has soared despite the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially as the harsh rhetoric and principles put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of being threatened with the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that those data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for escort status for orphaned minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are in our country illegally, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up processing of child issues, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month before being detained, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
A lot appears through video conferencing calls instead of in person to declare their case to be a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who, according to the report, are not entitled to help will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempted escape, asylum workers say, citing reports from the system over the past few months.
Advocates state that these concerns are heightened at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is suffering, more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time spent preparing emotionally or saying goodbye to friends could trigger a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish “occupying forces” should withdraw immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also the acting prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “this will be dealt with accordingly.”
"They must surrender immediately and unconditionally," he said at the rally.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more losing their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we get rid of all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegally present foreigners.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
While extraditing refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for them to return and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that caused the refugees to not want to return.
"We have asked international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no recovery aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last Idlib refuge has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front organization with links to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against intervening.
Why Trump will win in the second term
By this logic, Donald Trump would win another election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers hope, the impeachment and scandals did not prematurely end his presidency.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential term finale in history!”
Until now, there are no signs of fatigue following.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average prime-time viewership of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC has increased cable TV viewership to 3.5 million prime-time viewers.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of "Designated Survivor" on the ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedies and shows “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he’s funny,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story set in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged followers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward is using “deep backup” resources for his $15,000 book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather jackets (“arrogant clothes,” as reported by the Washington Post) and the consequences of Trump Storm’s disgusting “anatomy” portrayal of Daniel.
I’m not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.

He couldn't tear himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money flows from outside to the tightest home races of the mid-term choice
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a cash inflow after reorganizing congressional precincts that have generated two office holders in a fight for the same seat.
This recently led to the redesign of the suburban Pittsburg district by the district's Democratic Republican Conor Lamb - who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the maps were redrawed.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a sharp financial rift between the financial branches of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the monitored March special election for the 18th congressional district.
That seat was filled by a Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Policy experts give Democrats a slight head start.
U.S. Considers Fined El Salvador for Backing China
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially evicted the Trump leadership organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan further," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for narcotics control, development, and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rate.
As internal negotiations continue, North and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which were seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the US.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively cap any contemplated fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving a conference currently scheduled for mid-October, diplomats said, as part of the administration's signal for the meeting.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new adamant news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on terms of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the government's executive branch and has also spoken on condition of anonymity.
Study history
The final nail in the coffin could be a report by Robert Mueller of the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s law enforcement, of which there is now a lot of evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia over the attack on our election.
If there was a party swap in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to hold himself accountable before that body, just as he is preparing to come before the electorate again, and in the end, a jury of his colleagues would probably expect him.
That’s a lot of “ifs,” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, as it is with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long the tribulation will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all it took was for Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the inexorable course of democracy.
Americans now face several similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been on the hook ever since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president last year, speculating that he was not in a state of health to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested investigation into F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is upheld by the Supreme Court despite persuasive allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, are we going to vote mid-term for a Congress that assigns responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will face a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on the Sabbath, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday hosted Rapid Vienna, noting that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain on the course of Villarreal earlier this month would give them great hope of advancing from the Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury has prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance on the pitch in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the belief that we could grab something, and we took a point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it at the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be difficult because they had a good result in the last game, but with the spectators behind my back I am sure we can push and it will turn out well.
“Last year was tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I have a very good feeling about it here.
The team is strong and the guys are really enjoying it, the training is good too.
I hope we can put our backs on it now, put last season behind us and be successful."
Women worry about retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they should be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the national study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to discuss it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of National Life Insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for caregiving if you don’t reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining price.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to cover these expenses.
For example, you can fund long-term care with a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy to help you pay for these expenses, or your own self-insurance with your own funds - as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal battles while you can.
Choose a health care representative who will be a trustworthy person to oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing a power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not qualified to do so yourself.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your grandparent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write these details down in a written plan to get you ready.
“Not only finances are at stake, but, for example, what are the names of the attending physicians?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready at hand."
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times by an air gun.
When the man returned home after a night's drive, he was hit by several shots from an air rifle.
The roughly 40-year-old victim was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injured are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise further.
Since the communication is out of order, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Pal that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the disaster began.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the Donggala Regency, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalu have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Rim Ring of Fire and earthquakes regularly occur here.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake strikes near Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10 metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami formed, but more than 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily incarcerated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence, and resisting arrest.
When, according to the police report, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of $500, reports KTUU.
The network said he appeared in court on Saturday, saying he felt "definitely innocent" when asked for comment.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, over the phone.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possessing a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans' groups when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son's service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died since the Sulawesi earthquake struck on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications networks are down and death tolls are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck directly on the shores of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for death penalty for NYC terror suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of having committed a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - an exceptional sentence that has not been given for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly carried out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck that swept away pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - this is how the terms of the intent to impose the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both numbers would mean the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 offenses, including murder charges in favor of extortion, which federal prosecutors routinely use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” prosecutors claim, describing the way Saipa’s act was carried out as heinous, cruel and perverse.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Ferruchi’s playroom, Diego Mendoza’s playroom and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York last gave the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed, having been proven conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs took the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed minimal remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities he was inspired to commit the attack by watching Islamic State videos on the phone.
Police also said they wanted the Islamic State flag displayed in a hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “apparently disappointed” by the prosecutors’ decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea and a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
During today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference, Nigel Farage pledged to ‘mobilise the people’s army’.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party has said that politicians must “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics - as suggested by one of Theresa May’s own MPs, he should be leading the negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep divide, has been highlighted by the EU’s remaining conservatives, who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her Chequers compromise plan going under attack from Brexiteers, supporters of remaining in the EU and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to try to make a deal with Brussels regardless of the consequences - and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “screw the Chequers”.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he was in the lead, we’d be out by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to give up on Chequers.’
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that British citizens would change their mind and want to stay is utterly misguided.’
Andrea Jenkyns, a Brexit supporter who also attended the march, told reporters: “I simply say, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and neither our party members nor our activists, who are currently filling the streets, like to get elected.
Forget the Chequers and start listening.’
In a stark message to Mrs May, she says: ‘Ministerial chairmen will keep their seat when they keep their promises.’
Mr Farage said conservative politicians must “put themselves in an awkward position” if they were to betray their decision following the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are standing here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilising the army of the people of this country, which has secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud UK.”
Proponents of remaining in the Union meanwhile marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved anti-Brexit banners after the party's opening weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues with the party's app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think hard’ about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke Saturday afternoon event was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come “for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including the woman in the highest place.”
LSU suspect in shooting of Sims arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson, at 11:00 a.m. ET news conference.
A video was released of Friday's shooting with a request to identify the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that was incompatible with life," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday via the 247sports website.
Wayde tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to moving around the scene, carrying a gun, and admitting to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was interrogated without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6 foot and 6 inch tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton comes close to winning the World Championship, with team direction handing him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
Right when Valtteri Bottas finished qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team direction would play a big part in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver drove into the pits a lap later and joined Vettel after the exit, but Hamilton stepped forward and in a close duel the Ferrari driver had to reluctantly leave the internal track free to defend in turn three after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen took off from the rear of the field and was in the lead at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race as he kept the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
He eventually made it to the depot in lap 44, but failed to increase the pace in the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's rally for insisting she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention the testimony given to Ford before the Senate Judiciary Commission, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and abominable and lying."
"One thing that could happen, and a wonderful thing that's been happening in the last days in Senar, when you see the anger, when you see these people, how angry and evil and disgusting and lying," he said.
“If you look at the release and the publication and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you responsible for the leak?
Remember her answer... you posted the document -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't."
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose information about the case," Feinstein said.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did exactly what she asked."
But the president, who spoke at the rally on Saturday night, did not seem to believe her words: “I’ll tell you, it’s a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend a Supreme Court judge candidate who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, and suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to take back power by whatever means are available.
You see the wickedness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, they have to trample someone into the country to get back to power and to the helm,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning in Saturday's rematch at Dundee, which finished 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-goal lead thanks to interventions by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard then tied for Dundee again, whereupon Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two wickets secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for team Adam Keefe, who managed to beat 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season, with all three previous games dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull assisting, while David Rutherford scored an assist on Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first period was wild when Sullivan got the home team back into the game in a time of 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt set up a goal for Cownie, which he matched in a time of 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the booths for the first break after all in the lead, when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to score a goal from the power play in a time of 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later in the second period helped Nielsen switch the lead to Dundee for the first time in the match, and the same player insured his team's lead in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost their fourth of the last five games, will play another game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to allow hundreds of people on board plane to escape earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic chief is hailed as a hero after he died overseeing an aircraft with hundreds of people on board to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake rocked Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung’s colleagues were running to save their lives, he refused to leave his post in the wildly tossing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought he was sliding.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was taken to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for dealing with the disaster said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths is still increasing as many bodies are still left unextricated under the wreckage and many of them are still not reached by rescuers,” said Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho.
Waves in the devastated Pal reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies here.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks that are needed to evacuate.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific, said one person was missing, saying initially that all passengers and crew of 47 had safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find one of the passengers on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships assisted in rescuing other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at an airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon ahead of the runway.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
“That was very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get water to a belt deep into the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He further stated that the cabin crew were panicking and screaming and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked nearby on the pier's modifications helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat carrying passengers ashore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, a total of 111 people have died in PNG-registered plane crashes over the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred to Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution ended its speech Saturday in the case, in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
The analyst for the jury sketched out a scenario of how 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers used cell phone records from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers' company on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous testimony, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data from his cell phone showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he acknowledged that he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by police.
Sanford stood trial in a file and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis reported that he had known Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, cell phone records indicate that the two only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her completely from his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go before a jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has moved on from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and repopularize conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a revival in the recent past thanks to such artists as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
New York City governess sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
A New York City governess is suing the couple for her discriminatory firing after receiving a misspelled text message from her mother, in which she was labeled as "another black woman" by a text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her children's new governess, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ, NEXT BLACK," Ms Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
Understanding her faux pas, the “worried” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her outgoing governess, who was African-American, had been working really badly and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the sacking and seeking $350 per day of the six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not done,” she told The Post this Friday, adding: “I know this is discrimination.”
However, the pair returned the blow, saying that they were not racists, but that ending Mrs Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, as they feared they could no longer trust her after the insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your child to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “blackmail” and said his wife had only cared for a two-month-old child and was in “a very difficult situation.”
Would you ride someone like that?
That's not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the lawsuit is still pending, the jury on social media very quickly convicted the couple for their behavior and logic.
Paddington bear story publishers feared readers would not identify with the talking bear, latest news shows
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's adoption, said: "It's difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who is reading it for the first time, even before it's published.
But it's very funny to know now that we know the tremendous success of Paddington the Bear."
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before becoming inspired to write a children's book about the little teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which became a "sweet tooth" after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was a quiet man, he was never boastful,” she said.
But because Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like having a kid who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success from that perspective.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all successes only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn’t expect her to get out of it,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nada telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart going slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything had closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers without showing what a difficult test she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
"I kept my head down, tears streaming down my cheeks the whole time.
It's difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt overwhelming understanding of Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can seek support.
Mrs. Davis’ son, Tyler Davis, was only 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
“I wouldn’t want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling's still body after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about how this will affect his life."
Ms. Davis designed the postcards “to inform people that they have people available who are willing to help and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don't sit silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all,” he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Eve - when the kids opened the presents, didn't even look at them, nothing."
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she had to get over it: “This kind of thing can make a big hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something he was actually asking for - an investigation in a time of restriction, of limited scope - we could bring a little unity into it," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried the committee would "break up" because both sides would burrow into captured positions partisan.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to launch an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if Republicans perform as expected, it will lead to a major weakening in their attempts to get the man they want on the Supreme Court of this country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators, lobbying them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on this, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive a minimum of 50 votes in the Senate, which has been allowed by Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers “decreased” under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un’s rule began seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 escapes over the past year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr Park said it was due to tighter controls at the North Korea-China border and higher rates required by smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
Today, the vast majority of refugees from the North are being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in a state of war - have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This coincided with a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that his temperament made him unfit for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if any woman had ever performed such a spectacle, they would have called it 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both still in their teens.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking while dealing with his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying that their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” organized by liberals who failed to get over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to a question about whether she would seek Kavanaugh's dismissal if he were confirmed, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to tell you this - if he's not telling Congress the truth, then he's not only qualified to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's working on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential returns in court at the Acceptable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings preceding his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn any Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to just say, ‘Oh, that’s beautiful,’” Pelosi said.
And women must rule it.
After months and years of hate, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She continues: “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a director somewhere and who told me that she also cries when she’s angry, but she developed a certain technique. That means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job working in an office dominated by men. I once expressed my inexpressible anger there by crying. But an older, always cool manager, who I had always been a little worried about, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me onto the staircase.
“Never show them that you’re crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates running and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
But because the campaign had been running for a long time, she couldn’t keep up with the fundraiser, so she vowed not to fight unless she earned $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions - as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on the electors rather than the delegates, and anger over sexism that she was completely choking on with rage.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my headstone.
"Crying"?
Why the Sino-US trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say a rift between the countries will be advantageous to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, provided the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
But most major escalations came to light this week, when new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods were announced, effectively taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has always responded, most recently by imposing tariffs on 5 to 10 percent of 60 billion US goods imports.
China has tried to return the same coin to the US, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to get down on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to go back to its former ways, that would mean giving in to its demands, but public submission to US demands would be totally humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards right, the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that Washington’s or Beijing’s quick policy decisions could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic corkscrew in both countries, which is far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria ready to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to their normal state.
Now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
An additional 6 million people still live in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe responded decisively to the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil, not winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tour, then batted the ball into the water for 3 pars of 16th hole and let Francesco Molinari win.
Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players, achieving his best 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 and 4 by the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently attended his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thank you to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy, that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and has now set a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, having won the 14 greatest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team wrestled all weekend in an effort to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who performed top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing results of his team: “I’m proud of those guys, they really fought.
This morning, we really warmed up Europe.
We really didn't make it.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I was able to captain them.
I really have to take a dump.
You played us.”
Red tide updates: Concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC communication, spots of flowering water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - this indicates decreasing concentration.
The flowering water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
Spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but there were relatively fewer spots last week.
A red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
In Hillsborough, low to high concentrations were observed on the high seas, low to high concentrations in Manatee County, low to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas near Sarasota County, low to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, low to high concentrations off the coast or on the high seas near Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
