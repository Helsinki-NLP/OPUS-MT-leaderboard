MPs in the National Assembly of Wales fear they will “look like fools”
Some members of the National Assembly were frightened by the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal was made in connection with plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned that this could bring ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that "the acronym rhymes with twp and pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, “twp” means foolish, and “pwp” means poop.
A Walesa MP said the party as a whole was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative MP said his party was taking a "liberal" approach, but noted that it was not far from "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u".
The Commission of the Assembly is currently working on a draft law that will bring name changes, which stated: "Of course, the final decision on the possible designation of Members of the Assembly will be the responsibility of the Members themselves."
The Wales Administration Act 2017 granted the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the debate on the proposals with the public. The results showed that the change of the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament has broad support.
Regarding the designation of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred the name "Members of the Welsh Parliament" (WMP), but the MWP was given the most support in the public debate.
Members of the Assembly are clearly trying to propose alternative options, but it may be a problem to reach an agreement, especially for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include further changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on the exclusion of Members and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on their designation when they discuss the laws.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to “North Macedonia.”
The popular vote was announced in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name refers to Greek territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's applications for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Ďorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply a price the country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church have died down as a result of the problems of the churches in Harlem.
“The old people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams says.
“There is no one or the other today.”
In his opinion, the decline of bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently these days,” he says.
“The bar is no longer a living room where people from the neighborhood meet regularly.”
As for churches, he fears that money from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders think, “and sooner or later they will be back to square one.”
He said churches could be squeezed out by rental houses, with residential neighborhoods filled with people who will not support the remaining temples in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says. “It will bring the day closer when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people coming to these neighborhoods will belong to these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the capital of the black population. The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved away in the 1930s.
The building was claimed by a black congregation that performed worship nearby.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson. He was a central figure in the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (the most prominent store street in Harlem), who refused to hire and support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners had this bell played as part of the church's restoration plans.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called this chimes "the bells of the poor."
A specialist who played the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical tool.”
Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, said it was the first time a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played a chimes at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says no one at St. Martin's has replaced him.
Over the past few months, a complex story of architects and contractors has taken place in St. Martin’s Church. Some were brought in by secular church leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish administration, which is made up of secular leaders and runs the parish, wrote in July that it was concerned that the diocese would "let the parish administration reimburse" the costs, despite the parish administration not being involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency regarding the conduct of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Boy Who Hunted Lobsters Injured By Shark
Authorities said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday, hunting lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends dived for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and he and the group then sailed to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited about catching the lobster, but then “he found the boy screaming, ‘Something bit me!
“Something bit me!”
He had a completely torn collarbone," Hammel said, which he first noticed when he got to the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was airlifted to Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said in a briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have closed access to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to the Swami's area in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but they are mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's wants to create aisles with store-style cosmetics to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams. Dedicated assistants will be available.
This is a significant investment of 2.8 billion pounds in the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which is constantly growing, while sales in the fashion and household goods sector are declining. The investment will test larger aisles with cosmetics in 11 stores across the country. If this step is successful, more stores will be added next year.
The cosmetics investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the space on shelves that once belonged to televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its range of cosmetics to 3,000, with brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw available for the first time.
The current lines of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees products will be given more space, as there will be places reserved for brands like in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is re-launching its Boutique line of make-up so that most products are also available to vegans, as this is increasingly required by young customers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores. The first store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be open by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the trend of buying small amounts of food every day at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly resemble department stores. His supermarket chain is trying to compete with discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and other than food goods.
Sainsbury's incorporated Argos stores into hundreds of stores and also integrated several Habitat stores. Both chains were bought by the company two years ago. According to its representatives, this step increased food sales, making acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to innovate the departments of cosmetics and medicines ended in failure.
After 2000, Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots, but the merger ended a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio three years ago. The company owns the LloydsPharmacy chain, and the sales value was 125 million pounds.
The company said Lloyds would play an important role by adding a wider range of premium skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of the aisles to make shopping more enjoyable for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in special training of colleagues who will be on hand and ready to help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all requirements. Impressive environment and practical locations mean that we have become a major destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' that Holly Willoughby has terminated her contract for 11 million pounds
Peter Jones' Dragons' Day star is "furious" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has terminated an 11 million-pound contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of Truly interior accessories and accessories.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop.
The host of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby enraged the Dragons' Day star Peter Jones by backing out of the lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her own new mega-contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "furious" when a golden girl on television admitted during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that the new contracts -- valued at up to 1.5 million pounds -- meant he wouldn't have enough time to devote to their brand of True interior accessories and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated net worth of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of her vacation homes.
One of the sources said: “Project Truly was clearly Holly’s number one priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, and she was supposed to secure it for several decades ahead.
Her decision to leave shocked everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one understood what was happening. The launch was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods at the Marlowe headquarters."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of the show This Morning, which is one of the most lucrative stars of Britain, can cost the company millions. This is due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and home accessories, but also the possibility of further delaying the launch.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby proposed Project Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became director in March.
The two couples spend holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become an M&S brand ambassador, replacing Anta McPartlin, who hosts ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on business matters.”
A tough conversation and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism that awaits him from the media for his remark. Some will consider her a "unworthy president" and will reproach him for saying so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with a mocking “moderator” voice.
“I didn’t sacrifice anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the initial joint meeting in Singapore in June. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a big step on the way to eliminating North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's chief diplomat Ri Jong-ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "proportionate response" from the US to North Korea's first steps on disarmament.
He noted that the U.S. instead continues to apply sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to the assembly.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were threatened with war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: an end to missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended the unusual way he talks about relationships with Kim.
“It’s easy to talk like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people out there trying to get in, instead there would be 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake ravage one of Indonesia's islands, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to leave their homes, a nationwide disaster was not declared, which is a necessary condition for obtaining international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult,” she said.
Although Save the Children consists of a team that will travel to Pal, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to operate in the field.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly facing, the country’s readiness for the wrath of nature is deplorable.
Tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, but they are not common on other coasts.
Perhaps the lack of a tsunami-warning siren in Palo contributed to the large death toll, despite the fact that there was an active warning.
Even under favorable conditions, traveling between many Indonesian islands is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was on Lombok to provide care for the victims of the earthquake, is headed to Pal, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo built his election campaign to improve Indonesia's sprawling infrastructure. He spent generously on roads and railways.
But Widod’s administration is suffering from a lack of funds, with elections to be held again next year.
In addition, Widodo faces pressure over ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority adherents have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
During the fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets, more than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands more had to leave their homes. Gangs used machetes, bows and arrows, and other raw weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of FC Liverpool from a distance equalled against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League. He scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from the Chelsea gate. His team was losing 1-0 at the time.
He threw the ball to his left and sent a shot to a distant post.
His attempt glided high above the penalty area and headed to the top right corner of the gate.
The ball finally fell through the incoming Kepa Arrizabalag into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, players like Shaq are always trying to play as far forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kante was coming, I made one touch. I didn’t think much about it and I fired.”
Chelsea led at half-time 1:0. In the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored for her.
The Blues forward returned the pass to Mateo Kovacic before this goal, turning in the middle of the field and sprinting to half Liverpool.
Kovacic showed a quick bump in the middle of the field.
Then he sent out a beautiful pass that went with Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and finished at a more distant pole when he overtook Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool face off against Napoli in the Champions League group stage starting Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will fight against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 15:00 in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
According to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters high, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been filled with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman who was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging people in the area who have seen or heard something to come forward to testify.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also encourage anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded anything using the dash cam, to contact us as they may have key information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who believe they know the woman and wanted to find out where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police said they are now informing the victim's family members.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to get into his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to say anything.
The owners of the apartments are currently learning that they will get inside again in a few hours.
One police officer was heard telling another man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
He kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, another van was out.
There were several policemen in the cordon watching the panel house.
Police are asking anyone who has information to send a direct message to the MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, citing the September 30, 247 protocol.
Cromwell's statue in front of parliament is the latest landmark to be touched by controversy over 'rewriting history'
Removing it would be the satisfaction of his fanatical Puritan followers like the Taliban to destroy so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell's company, however, called Crick's proposal "foolish" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was self-evident that Oliver Cromwell’s character outside the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell neither ordered nor carried out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps he would have been sacrificed by the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent realization of Cromwell by Sir William Ham Thornycroft testifies to his perception in the 19th century and is part of the history of a personality that many believe still deserves respect."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more than he was at the end of the 19th century, to be the protector of parliament from outside forces, in his case of course the protector of the monarchy.
Historians continue to debate whether this is a completely accurate account of reality.
What is certain, however, is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a unique figure who embodies one side of that dispute.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and respect."
Deadly Pig Slams Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by pigs at a market in southeastern China.
The man, who is referred to only by the surname Yuan, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui prefecture in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing a vaccine in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China.
On Wednesday, he reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found the side door open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the court investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram boar had bruised the farmer to death.
"The cousin had bloody and crushed legs," said a cousin named Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
According to CCTV footage, Yuan arrived at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was separated to avoid attacking anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although attacks by pigs on humans are rare, they have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, inflicting critical injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295-kilogram pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife managed to scare the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
Shantia, they're curious... they don't intend to hurt anyone.
We just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains in many places in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
In the coming days, however, dew will bring torrential rains in the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, the dew reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, a category 1 hurricane, located 620 kilometers southwest of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia promontory.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a riverbed has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving east toward the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she begins to push deep tropical moisture north to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring more than 25 centimeters of rainfall to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture will then, in combination with the approaching trough, create extensive and heavy rains in the coming days in the southwest.
In some places, 2 to 10 centimeters of rainfall will fall, causing severe dangerous floods, flooding of debris, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes rains, during which 5 to 8 millimeters of precipitation per hour falls, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas in the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 5 and 10 centimeters.
Severe flooding can occur, as conditions deteriorate rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
Given the threat of tropical rain, it would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can cause rivers to rage in the canyons, with thunderstorms locally bringing violent winds with dust in the air.
The approaching trough in some parts of the southern California coast will cause heavy local rains.
More than 13 millimetres of precipitation may fall, which could cause debris to float and slippery roads to a lesser extent.
It would be the first rain in the area during its rainy season.
Scattered showers of tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late evening and early Monday morning, and rain will be widespread on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the Four Corner States and last until Wednesday.
There may be significant temperature fluctuations throughout the US in October, as the Arctic is cooling, while the tropical zone remains relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature at a short distance.
A good example of this is the temperature change in the United States on Sunday.
The difference between the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is almost 11 degrees.
Over the next few days, he will try again to assert and spread the persistent summer heat.
The warm beginning of October is expected in many places in the middle and east of the US, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees in several areas from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
In New York City, it could be 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. throughout the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the impressive testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault on six television networks on Thursday. The attack on Christine Blasey-Ford allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
It wasn’t until Friday that radio and television stations cut the air for a last-minute twist: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake secured a deal allowing the FBI to investigate allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was groping her drunk and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, who spoke passionately, said he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers watched the broadcast, which was announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted average ratings from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
For other broadcast networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring ratings in offices.
For comparison, a similar number of spectators watch the American football playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, which was strongly supported by opinion-forming broadcasters for the appointment of Kavanaugh, was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long interview, the most of any network, according to Nielsen.
The ABC station was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
There was a lot of interest after the interview.
The main character of Friday's drama was Flake.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning, yelling at him as he tried to get the elevator to question the Judiciary Committee.
For a few minutes, he stood with his eyes down and listened to the remorse that was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one of the women.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
Someone told him, “You have great power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement before the elevator closed, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All of the cable and other networks also discussed the matter live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on whether to refer Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee over the next week, which are urged by minority Democrats.
Flake was persuaded in part by talks with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake’s election had a lot of power because it was clear that Republicans would not get enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of 'playing political games' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her intention to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which is located next to an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her Brexit plan, which is likened to a game of checkers. He said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other is "absolutely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dytheon Simpson in Connection with LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect who allegedly shot Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dytheon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of an altercation between Sims and Simpson. Police said Sims lost his glasses during the battle.
Police secured the glasses at the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found on them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Sims.
According to the defense attorney, his bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the state police crime lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "efforts and the promotion of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
“This is what you’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash on the city of Mexico
The ash that flows from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid the volcano, after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were registered in 24 hours.
The center has seen noise and tremors several times.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found an increase in the volcano's activity, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with riot police, with thousands more taking part in parallel demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede that is dividing society.
A group of masked separatists were stopped by riot police, throwing eggs and powder paint, and so the streets, which at other times swarmed with tourists, were filled with dark clouds of dust.
Later in the day, clashes occurred, and police used truncheons to bring the thugs under control.
Within a few hours, a group of independence supporters who sang “we don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist Protestants who shouted “Long live Spain.”
According to local press reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum declared Madrid illegal, tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region, but Catalan separatists celebrated it.
A large majority of voters chose independence, but turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the vote.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police attempted to block the continuation of voting in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Groups of independence supporters camped out Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to go in a different direction.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer believed Catalonia would achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
My parents cried with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," she says.
Although Catalan political parties demanding independence in regional elections last December won a close (but important) victory, they are no longer succeeding this year. Many of their most famous leaders have themselves gone into exile or are awaiting trial for their part in holding a referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who shoots a protest in support of police by phone, says politicians on both sides contributed to the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression shown to us by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for crashing car into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, there may have been a shooting at the car from a crossbow.
Meng's goal marked Livingston's 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga scores first goal for Livingston
Livingston shocked the Rangers and left Steven Gerrard with only his second loss in 18 games since joining Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's intervention proved decisive. Thanks to him, Gary Holt's team made it to the second Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team is still out of the Premiership without a win this season and next Sunday will be rivaled by the leader of Hearts, who is eight points behind.
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended his streak of invincibility in the league to six games. Head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miler last month, has still not experienced the bitterness of losing.
Livingston Burns Chances Against Stuttered Guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the goal.
Scott Robinson penetrated, but his attempt passed at the gate. The ending of Alan Lithgow then only went sideways when he reached Craig Halkett's head at the gate with a slide.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could cause problems from standard situations.
And that was the decisive goal.
A direct free-kick was played against the Rangers and Livingston managed to break through, Declan Gallagher and Robinson after the combination found Menga and he scored from the middle of the penalty area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the ball, but were unable to overcome home defense, and goalie Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to take action.
Scott Pittman's attempt stopped Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow ended another standard situation for Livingston next door.
Livingston's centre-backs kept turning away, but players twice demanded penalties - after Halkett's move to replace Glenn Middleton and the alleged hand - the referee allowed the game to continue.
"Phenomenal" Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and outcome of Livingston.
All the players as one man were exceptional. On their way up, they continue to exceed expectations.
The style of the game and the players on the team have hardly changed since returning to the top tier, but Holt deserves great credit for how he has lifted the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was incredible, driving a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall out of the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Under Gerrard, they played very well several times, but this level is far from being achieved.
They missed the final pass - they only got behind the home defense once - and for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, it's a raised warning finger.
Erdogan not only received a warm welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin and the mood was excellent.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany. The purpose of the visit is to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose because of problems relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque there.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police said they had prevented a group of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters nearby who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of them Kurds) also made themselves known, denouncing Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Contradictory protests show a difference of opinion about this guest. Some German Turks invoke him as a hero, while others condemn him for autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: the death of a cyclist after a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver stopped the car and medics came to the scene, but the cyclist died of injuries on the spot.
The accident occurred just months after another cyclist was killed by a driver who fled the scene of the accident. The accident happened on Childers Street, about 1.5 kilometers from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police were trying to identify the man and inform relatives.
There is a closed road on the site, diverted bus service, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Riots
Six prison guards were injured during riots in a high-security male prison, the prison administration said.
The riots broke out at around 9:30 a.m. British summer time at the British Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Officers of the Tornado special unit were called to the scene to bring the riots under control, and eight prisoners were responsible for them, who managed to be separated into one wing.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison administration spokesman said: “We have deployed a specially trained detention unit to resolve the ongoing incident at the British Long Lartin Prison.
Six workers were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in prisons and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and they can stay behind bars longer."
At Long Lartin Prison, he is serving more than 500 prison sentences, including the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison ended up in the hospital after being attacked by one of the inmates.
Last October, an anti-rebellion unit was also called to the prison to end the serious riots, when prisoners attacked the guards with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (can benefit areas affected by drought)
Tropical pressure below in Arizona is an exceptional phenomenon. However, it is likely to occur at the beginning of next week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is directed through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for the area from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rains looming late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones within a 320-kilometer radius of Phoenix have had tropical storm or below-pressure status since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, while in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona it may be up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, 25 to 50 millimeters are likely to fall, exceptionally up to 100 millimeters.
In places where there is no threat of flooding, the rain caused by the dew can be useful, as the area is plagued by drought.
Although the floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing at least an extreme drought, the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa first crosses the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, is located 620 kilometers south of the Mexican promontory of Punta Eugenia and is heading north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, thus losing intensity.
Therefore, when it reaches the Mexican mainland on Monday afternoon or evening, it is expected to have the power of a tropical storm.
The amount of precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be large, which means a high risk of flooding.
“A total rainfall of between 75 and 150 millimeters is expected between Baja California and northwest Sonora, and in some places it could be as high as 250 millimeters,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then continue as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north until she reaches the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical pressure point, which will then head up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger to Rosa or her remains is the very large amount of rainfall in the Baja California area, in the northwest of Sonora and in the desert southwest of the US,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening flash floods and debris drifts in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three boys between the ages of 17 and 18 and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy who was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight in the Radstock area, police said.
Police are asking anyone who has seen the incident to come forward to testify.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for rejecting the Democratic Party’s reckless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally dismissing Christine Blasey-Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also pleaded guilty to the charges.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people had the opportunity to see Kavanaugh’s uniqueness, character and courage.”
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of today’s most respected legal experts and a lawyer with a perfect history of serving the public,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“There are five weeks left until the elections, which are among the most important in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
“That’s why I’m doing my best to support exceptional candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats’ goal was to “resist and hinder.”
The Senate's first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be on the agenda no later than Friday, a senior Republican party official told CNN.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives and many were carried away by waves when huge waves caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves as high as six meters hit the coast in the early evening. The waves destroyed everything in their path, and many people came and life.
The tsunami followed an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach. They did not run away right away and became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone. It took away cars, beams, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h in the open sea before it hit the coast.
He said some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Air photos released by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, earthquakes continued in the coastal town.
Several earthquakes have been recorded in the area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful earthquake exceeded the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The agency said the intensity of the tsunami could have increased the location of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "substantial" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, department stores and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage could be greater in the Donggala area, which is located 300 km along the coast north of Palu. The area is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications “were completely paralyzed” and from Donggala “no information is available,” Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency faced widespread criticism on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami in Palo, but authorities said the waves had arrived by the time a warning was issued.
On an amateur recording shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard shouting desperate warnings at people down the street that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, a water wall hit the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications with the city of Palu and the surrounding area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes to the site from Jakarta and elsewhere, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened to aircraft only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision workers from Donggala made their way safely to Palu, where employees hide in tarpaulin shelters created in the office yard, they passed through devastated areas along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
When humanitarian groups embarked on a difficult task and began work on post-disaster reconstruction, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Palo.
Under Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and workers from other countries can only start arriving if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says this is a national disaster, we can open the door to international aid, but this has not yet happened.”
When the second night of the Palu earthquake and tsunami came, the families and friends of the missing were persistently hoping that their loved ones would be a miracle in the grim story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was trapped between ruins and her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who remained trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“Since I’ve been paragliding for a long time, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Subandono described how hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel crash circled the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palo, who attended a beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one gray check mark instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who refilled an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at this entertainment complex and was about to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a report.
While he was busy, another man “runs out from behind the back of a Brink’s worker” and steals a bag with money to put in.
According to the report, witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not indicate the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
If you have information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: reper changes its name to Ye
Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "A being officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is scheduled to unveil his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think the word ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and it means ‘you’ in the Bible,” West said this year as he spoke about the title of his album with Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From the word Kanye, which means ‘one’, only Ye came into being. It reflects what is good in us, bad, confused, everything.
The album reflects who we are.”
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's associate, JAY-Z, also presents with hyphens and no hyphens, in both upper and lower case.
Mexican President vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never and under no circumstances use the military to overpower the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot peaceful protesters in the square, killing as many as 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to assert themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans with monthly student grants and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities cause young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. to double investment in artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, said investor and artificial intelligence promoter Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after various U.S. government entities commented on artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a general formal strategy regarding artificial intelligence.
On the contrary, China unveiled its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in artificial intelligence innovation.
“With all other countries much further behind the U.S. and trying to make another breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI), a doubling of the UI budget would be a good start,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances of us achieving another big success in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American player under the name Othello, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and CEO of Google’s Chinese subsidiary.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to help reveal future visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“Academic leaders are not taken away from us by China, but by large corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best minds from universities to work for them on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in AI.
“I think the holders of a PhD in AI should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
China’s State Committee released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to American scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve partners from industry and academia. The White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
On the contrary, there has been no activity in the U.S. legislation that sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonia votes in referendum on name change
The citizens of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia." This move would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments drew up a deal in June that included a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a prize worth admitting Macedonia, a country that emerged after the demise of Yugoslavia, to communities such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for a future for the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgiyevska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the will of the voters and make decisions based on the result.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no irregularities during the referendum until 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place lies in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in the Macedonian referendum on changing the country's name to join NATO and the European Union in the Macedonian city of Strumica on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, erected a small podium in front of the parliament in Skopje and dragged the chairs in front of tents erected by opponents who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We may be poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I am convinced that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that 30 to 43 percent of voters are preparing for the referendum - which is below the threshold of the required turnout.
Another poll, carried out by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to leadership in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero overcomes Brighton's entire defence and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defense at Etihad on Saturday and secured a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero's elegant goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first glance.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He clicked through the three Brighton defenders and ran out into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed himself around one defender and then circled several others on the edge of the Brighton block.
He sent a pass to the left where the ball found Sterling.
The English striker touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguero, who right-handedly overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguera has some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about playing around 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what it was.
We were lucky to score at that point.”
But it was Sterling who secured Cityzens’ opening advantage in the Premier League.
His goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero reached the ball deep in Brighton during this game.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling towards the far post.
Attacker Cityzens tapped the ball into the net just before it slipped into the car.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies' chances
When the Nationals dropped out of the playoffs, there were not many reasons to force themselves into another start.
But Scherzer is hoping to face the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if only there can still be consequences for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division.
With a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have at least retained the wild card option, but they still have to confirm their first division title.
Even if we’re not playing for anything, at least we can still get on the pitch with the idea that with the atmosphere here in Denver and with this crowd and this opponent, that’s probably the highest level we’re going to get to this year.
Of course I want to experience it.”
The Nationals haven't announced their first pitcher for Sunday yet, but apparently they're going to let Scherzer pitch in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th start, threw a bullpen on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, when he normally has a rest day.
The Washington right winger has an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The president made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve achieved will be at stake.
There are only five weeks left until the most important elections of our lives.
It's a huge, huge opportunity, and even though I'm not running, I'm actually running, which is why I'm going up and down the country and fighting for our great candidates."
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, really terrible, radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right in front of our eyes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary, wickedly and maliciously.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, went on a mission to “resist and hinder.”
“You could see it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, mean, evil, and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, namely Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was met with loud booing from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um, no, I, wait -- her body language was really bad -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer liberal.
They do not tolerate those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists voted for my reprimand, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last Labour MP to be told he is no longer welcome - all for expressing an opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, he criticized the reprimand motion for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically similar issues, on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
An invitation to a Labour meeting for Nottingham said Friday that "we want the sessions to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday evening GC sessions were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, many meetings today do not sound like this, and the promise of a “gentle, gentler” policy is long forgotten, if ever.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because colleagues who I had previously thought shared a similar political stance suddenly expected me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views I would otherwise never have agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there's a tirade of criticism on social media calling for an appeal, a renunciation of the centre-right politics, and listening as if I'm not supposed to be in the Labour Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments directed at me tend to be only political.
I admire the professionalism and commitment of colleagues who face the thunder of sexist or racist attacks on a daily basis and never hide from it.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is that the level of attacks has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer the notorious liberals, and with every incentive to express “distrust” or change the selection rules, the party is becoming increasingly narrower.
Over the past two years, a lot of people have advised me not to stand out from the crowd too much, be quiet and keep up, and then I’ll be “okay.”
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the indifference of the Thatcher government, which allowed my high school classroom to literally collapse, I have been trying to promote better public services for those who needed it most, whether in the local council or in the ministry.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East constituency could have been confused by my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative on Friday, I would only say that when the country is moving toward a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy dealing with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have does not belong to Momentum in Nottingham. It is for the residents of my district, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you and I promise you that no threats of appeal or political calculation will deter me from trying to enforce what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr makes it to the top
Two late attempts may have waved the final result slightly, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly engaging match of the Tennent’s Premiership day.
He is now at the top of the table as the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, winning brought home great defense as well as better use of chances, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be happy.
“We’ve had a lot of tests during the games and we’re undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Hats off to Ayr, they took a chance better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to convert Frazier Climo put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to outnumber and Jason Baggot to write down an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended the lead of Ayr with a penalty and then, at exactly half-time, scored a solo attempt, thanks to which Ayr could go on a break with a result of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
This was followed by a lengthy delay due to serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was weaned, and as soon as the game began to resume, Ayr got further into the lead by Stafford McDowall's attempt to turn Climo.
Acting Ayr captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it in the form of an unaltered attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the encounter under heavy pressure.
However, the home side revived and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting Clima without the ball, MacPherson reached a touch-down from a penalty shootout with an approaching horde of Ayr behind his back.
Climo turned, much like almost at the start of the event, after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing away on his fifth home try.
Still Game star embarks on a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is apparently starting a career in service. According to our information, he was appointed as the director of a company with a license to operate a restaurant.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in along with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their last, and Kiernan appears to be already planning his life outside Glasgow’s Craiglang suburb.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told The Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to restore access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors besiege the naval headquarters at La Paz dressed in sails.
There are blue flags in public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titikaka to the Amazon are emblazoned with the motto: “The sea is our right.
Getting it back is our duty.”
Across Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still alive - as is the desire to sail the waters of the Pacific Ocean once again.
After five years of hearings, Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1.
“Bolivia is on the rise, it has a spirit of unity and equanimity, and of course it believes in a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the international court on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, so that after decades of intermittent negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to provide sovereign access to the sea of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who will take part in a controversial re-election battle next year, also has something to say about Monday’s decision.
“Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in Bolivia’s favor - and if it did, not much would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ruling comes only six months after hearing the final arguments suggests that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And while there can be no doubt about Bolivian arguments, it is possible that it has taken a step backwards in recent years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been appropriated by the current Bolivian government,” said Zarate.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric undermined all remaining friendliness with Chile, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate one day, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain dialogue.
The two countries have not had each other's embassies since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, dismissed the idea that the court's decision would be unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreement and achieve mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also dismissed the claim that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea Rejects Nuclear Disarmament Until It Can Trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country won’t get rid of nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor its pledges made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the cusp of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it is an illusion to think that continued U.S. sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without first taking significant steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing its arsenal, which the country is very likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
Paris fashion shows list the latest trends in impressive headwear that you’ll soon find in your store
If you want to expand your hat collection or perfectly protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a whole range of unusual oversized headwear in their Spring/Summer 19 collection at the pier, which wowed viewers at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the catwalk.
A unique piece from Valentino was a bulky beige hat decorated with a down roof that covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include a melon inlaid with gemstones, a witch's hat, and even pineapple - but these aren't meant to warm you up.
Thom Browne also showed off a selection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks were sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled a diving outfit, including a snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashion statements - you're in luck.
Style experts predict that giant hats will also make their way to the regular stores around you.
Oversized hats follow the inspiration of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a roof 60 centimeters wide, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
The iconic brand behind the highly impractical hat that lurked around every corner of social media sent another large creation onto the catwalk - a straw beach bag almost the size of a model wearing a bathing suit carrying it.
Framed by fringes of raffia and complemented by a white leather ear, the red bag was a unique piece of Jacquemus’s La Riviera spring/summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
A celebrity stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to come into mainstream stores next summer - since the designer has had such a tremendous impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Without language skills, a global citizen cannot do
Scottish independent schools maintain excellent academic performance and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of extraordinary exam results, further strengthening individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, careers as they see fit, and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement tailor-made curricula, we still perceive modern languages as a popular and sought-after selective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you are speaking to his heart.”
It is a strong reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest grade average among independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest A grade in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered to be as important as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as selection subjects in independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited as problems in filling jobs were lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities arise that are required by languages, these skills become essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he learned a second language, with such a lifelong ability he will have a real advantage for the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any foreign language sufficiently to be able to converse fluently, with French being the only language in which many people fell into double-digit percentages (15 percent).
Therefore, it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially the languages of advanced economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will vary according to the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, independent schools will always be able to choose from a variety of languages and will be taught by experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages remain crucial for the country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be called “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron to debut in San Diego on Sunday
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting for them shortly.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening preseason match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James commented on his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to start the prep games anymore,” he said.
Trump meetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has begun a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s planned meetings next week, including stops at related locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
After abstaining from a vote for his candidate for a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections (Midterms) as Republicans risk losing control when they vote in November.
What time is the Trump meeting in West Virginia today and where can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online below, via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on the current hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which was strained over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected Senate confirmation vote adjourned for a week pending FBI investigations.
But the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who are facing tough November elections, regain power.
According to Reuters, the five meetings next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that as many states as possible will be visited by the president as he enters a busy election season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's meeting, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in a month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to back West Virginia’s Republican nominee Patrick Morrisey, whose polling preferences are lagging behind.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to pick up his polling preferences,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Courage to Fight and Hopes for Success in Sunday’s Individual Battles
After three one-sided series, foursome matches on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
Although the swinging pendulum of the driving force is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
So, which side do they think the driving force is on now?
"They led by six points, now it's only four, so we could say we have a slight momentum now," Jordan Spieth said as he prepared for his competition day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, a four-point lead and another twelve in the game.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel a slight wind in their sails and have plenty to hope for, among other things, thanks to the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from the tee to the last hole and leads others by his example.
As his lap progressed, the guttural celebratory screams became louder while sinking a key putt and a fourth match was undecided when he and Thomas had two fewer by two.
He celebrated his putt, which won them a match at 15, with a similar cry that proves his belief that the American team is not yet lost in the competition.
“You just have to roll up your sleeves and get on with it, just think about your own game,” Spieth said.
There is nothing else left for any of the players.
18 holes in which you have to achieve the maximum.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed favourites of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming European couple has four out of four and has no way to make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the other nine holes on Friday morning.
This round and the way energy flows between the tumultuous crowd and the players confirms that these players will need to be beaten on Sunday, and there is hardly a more popular player to consolidate a potential European win at sunset over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best both at the same time on different holes.
But talk of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played in a pair with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the first nine holes dug a hole for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they were no longer able to dig.
On Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome games are fascinating when you look closely at the interactions between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give each other, and how strategy can change from minute to minute.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a substantial lead towards the final day, but these foursome rounds have also shown that the US team is not afraid to fight back, something some, especially on the American continent, have doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a substantial advantage after finishing Saturday's fourball and foursome matches with the lead against the United States 10:6.
Encouraged by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the duo led the charge with two victories over struggling Tiger Woods to score four points so far in their account at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, struggling to retain the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the failing American side in the early games of fourball and won the series 3-1.
In the foursome games, the Americans offered more resistance, winning two games, but failed to see their deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while together with Molinari, under the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are only the second pair to win four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball matches, they solidified their performance excellently and beat down down Woods and U.S. rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who staggered through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately lost 19 of his 29 games of fourball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the morning fourball games, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome, and together they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not have it easy on that pleasant, fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball matches and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome matches after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team managed to get out of a four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Furyk's side as a defender of the title only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two full days, Sunday’s counterattack seems likely to be beyond their reach.
North Korea will not unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions had deepened mistrust of the United States and that the country would in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "substantial steps" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and pledging not to expand nuclear weapons and technology.
“We don’t see any response from the United States,” he added.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is out of the question that we will be the first to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s opposition to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his position was crucial in not immediately rejecting unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea a guarantee of security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to release strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists first on nuclear disarmament and increases the level of tension through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of an end to war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is an illusion of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the U.S. president told the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he stressed three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea instead of the US, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.”
Still, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “President Evil” Trump called Kim a “rocket on a suicide mission.”
This year, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, sang at the UN praising Kim for his courage in taking disarmament action, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea is cleared of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timetable for the move, adding: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two, three years or five months.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the application of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue rigorously and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and verified nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to throttle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon earlier this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle both the missile test site and the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he expected were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course on How to Get Enough Rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is for all students to get more sleep in an effort to curb the growing trend of studying throughout the night with the help of caffeine.
Researchers have found that students at the world’s leading university are often baffled when it comes to the very basics of taking care of their health.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Clinic, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to set up the course after a lecture he gave on sleep deprivation and its impact on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my senior year?’
She claimed that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which took place for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help both academic and sports performance while improving general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health service, said the university had decided to open the course when it discovered that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the workweek.
The course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, the screen shows a picture of a boarding room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light, and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance and how important a regular sleep schedule is.
In the next section, participants will learn how long-term sleep deficits can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the university campus with interactive icons also encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know about it - just as everyone has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture in which students are proud of being able to learn all night long, she says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate, good-quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, even against weight gain, as sleep deficits put the brain into starvation mode, leaving them constantly feeling hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue the course at the university level.
It hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar course of study before embarking on a demanding course of study.
Prof. Czeisler advises students to set an alarm both for when to go to bed and for when to wake up, and to become aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1: 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of mourning at the away game when a Dolly Menga shot sent Steven Gerrard's disbanded team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The guests from Ibrox tried to record their first away win since the February 4-1 triumph at St Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only brought Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team 8 points from the Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, who are the Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers line-up, lacking inspiration, did not even come close to equalising.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third and lags behind Hibernian with just one goal difference.
And the Rangers may have other problems after line referee Calum Spence suffered a head injury because he was hit by an object apparently thrown from the gueststand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and subsequently the Rangers overtook Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11th to Livi, who took away the Hearts point last week, and was thrilled with the way his well-rounded team suffocated their opponents in every action.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were due to score only in the second minute of the match when the first Menga draw from the field sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder missed his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' long straight kick then found captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to miss the back pole by far.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, they seemed to have hope rather than conviction in their game.
Alfredo Morelos claimed the right to a penalty after a quarter of an hour of play when he collided with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only managed two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely out of line with Lassana Coulibaly and the tame Ovie Ejaria shot.
Although Livi’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been at odds with the course of the game, no one can argue that they deserved it just because of their efforts.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' corner.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher moved the ball through the slit to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard took action in the break, swapping Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing striker found Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line and blocked him.
But Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the type of game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after another.
Holt's side could stretch their lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then also withstood Lithgowej's wide head from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton also claimed a penalty when he got involved with Jacobs, but Thomson missed it again.
The inventor of Geiger's computer
And here we have a page from our Sunday morning chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the construction of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an integral part of science to this day, became a fixture of pop culture when it was talked about in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by the cowboys who smelled of science, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger's computer, it detects radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you really hear the sounds of atoms being made by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
“Seriously, I can hear them cracking!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells in Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their treatment in the laboratory
They then “see” the protein common in many types of cancer and inject themselves back into the body.
The tested vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this method, the patient’s immune cells are extracted, modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common in many types of cancer, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells worked in treating certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West wearing a MAGA hat was criticized for his support of Trump after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great cap, he launched an attack against the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked to a white guy so many times and he said, ‘How can you recognize Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was plagued by racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live (SNL) began with a scene featuring Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech was not aired, comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West by sharing.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time backstage for his cap.
“I was bullied backstage.
They told me, ‘Don’t go in there with that hat on your head.’
They used to bully me!
And then they told me I was broke," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see me at the bottom? I’m going to put on my Superman cape because it means no one is going to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and the rest of the SNL performers were embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling the media, "There was a grave silence throughout the studio."
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West surprised many when he performed the song I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
TPUSA leader Candace Turner tweeted: "A message to one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AGAINST THE GAV."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “simply was himself, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
But I am determined NOT to reward someone (by buying their music, clothing brand, or promoting their “art”) who I believe adopts and propagates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would now be “Ye,” formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was also named Snoop Lion, and there is, of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man suffered stab wounds at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police confirmed the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-armed Jon Snow in HBO's gritty medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of a male hero, saying that for such characters on the screen, young boys often feel that they have to be tough to respect them.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he says that “something got out of hand and is thinking about how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old, admitted that solving the problem was “very important.”
“Personally, I feel it’s very important to address where something went wrong in our masculinity,” he said.
“What do we teach men during adolescence when the problem we see now arises?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity for its overly masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What does television teach, and what is happening on the streets, that young boys feel they must have this certain side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
“Something has gone wrong with young people.”
In an interview, he also said that when the series ends next summer, he will no longer be filming any prologues or sequels to Game of Thrones because he is “already finished with the battlefields and the horses.”
Starting in November, Kit will star in a new adaptation of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
“It was through this show that I met my wife, so in a sense she gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, she played Rose Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie Family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 year-on-year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
As a result of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with a man end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking GOP senators’ data, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to a Wikipedia page to a lawmaker.
The Los Angeles Democrat says the allegations come from “ultra-right” experts and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information emerged online Thursday, released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate jury hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the leaks were linked to Waters' office and provided information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
“This unconfirmed allegation is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of such fraudulent and false allegations was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters’ statement quickly attracted criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Her denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He must not behave defiantly.
It must not call into question the applicant’s motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer apparently compared Waters's reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh by Democrats, who were accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is running for Waters’s seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s big,” he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and will be held legally accountable for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Undersized Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
Today, it is common to look for references to Brexit in every new film with a British point of view, and this also applies to this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English - which was first introduced in 2003 by Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 in Johnny English Returns.
Will it become an ironic self-satisfaction about how we are obviously incapable of new national export articles?
In any case, Johnny English, with his distinctive facial expression, has had the opportunity to screw things up again - and his name signals better than anything that he is a generous comic creation designed especially for non-English viewers.
He is, of course, the clumsy secret agent who, despite the bizarre claims of subtle glamour, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a spoonful of the guy who contributed a single note to the opening tune of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The character is originally based on an international traveler and a mysterious man who Atkinson once played in now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
In this last adventure of Johnny English you can find one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English came to the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller slightly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is evident here, but the humor sounds a bit under-stimulated and oddly superficial, especially as “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are already confidently offering comedy as one of their ingredients.
Humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s strange adventures are not as inventive and fitting as Atkinson’s gags without words by Mr. Bean.
The current background to the story of the film is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy web network and, to the dismay of the acting agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only missed a small role, has uncovered the identities of all British agents in the area.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a pompous and combative figure already on the verge of collapse because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a quasi-type character like Teresa May, but she has little to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that if every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to call someone retired.
So Johnny English himself comes on the scene, now employed as a director in a fancy institution, giving private lessons on how to become a secret spy: here you will find a few pleasant gags, as English gives lessons on espionage in the style of the School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets his former longtime sidekick Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, chained to an affected submarine commander, for whom Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a shame.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disaster in Her Majesty’s Secret Service, are back in full force, bumping into a beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: Jake Lacy plays the sinister Jason Volta.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd skirmishes: in disguise as waiters, they set a shiny French restaurant on fire; they cause chaos when they sneak onto Volt's luxury yacht; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality device to get acquainted with the interior of Volt's house.
All the tricks are pulled out in the last few minutes, but no matter how impressive and tumultuous, it all feels a bit like a children’s TV show.
The overall impression is more or less average.
And as with all the Johnny English movies, I still have to think, why doesn't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour Denies Work on British Four-Day Work Week Plan Paid as Five-Day Work
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is expected to consider a radical plan to give Britons a four-day workweek, but they get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate executives to redistribute the savings generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to give workers an extra day off.
It would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend, but home would carry the same paychecks.
Sources say the idea would "match" the party's economic plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “We expect an evaluation of the proposal to be published by the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an effort that aligns the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour would not be the first to support the idea, with the Greens including a four-day working week in their 2017 election campaign.
The Labour Party as a whole, however, is not advocating for this.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a policy of the party, nor is it considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to deliver his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell stated his determination to reclaim power from “anonymous CEOs” and “rich” in the service industry.
At the same time, the shadow chancellor’s plans mean that the current shareholders in the water companies would not be able to get their shares back, as the Labour government could apply “collapses” due to an identified wrongdoing.
At the same time, he confirmed plans to include employees on company boards and create Inclusive Equity Funds, so that 10 percent of private sector companies’ equity can reach employees, who could receive annual dividends of up to 500 euros.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said on 60 Minutes that the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley, Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“As I said, when I went to the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusations were made, and asked, ‘Did you do that?’
He was determined and clear.”
However, Graham’s voice seems firmly established.
"I've already made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and there would have to be some bulletproof charges," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has vigorously denied everything,” Graham said.
“No one he appoints can confirm that.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don’t see how anything can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to poverty reduction?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive crowd of stars, will take place in New York with an even more impressive mission: to end world hunger.
In its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on Central Park’s Big Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
First held in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to an event (unless they’re willing to pay for a VIP ticket), viewers must complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or some other meaningful way to raise awareness of the event’s goal of ending poverty.
There are still 12 years left, so how does Global Citizen actually achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to persuade them to take action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” - when people feel they are actually making a difference when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Global Citizen says it has seen more than 19 million “shares” since 2011 from its supporters, moving toward a variety of goals.
These actions have helped galvanize world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group said that 390 commitments and statements had been made, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the seized funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The pledges include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who are committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government has announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition benefits.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “How do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It’s going to be a long and arduous journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the celebrities who will perform at this year’s event in New York, along with presenters Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as ‘blockade’ to curb Russian energy exports, interior secretary says
“If necessary,” Washington can call on its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's involvement in Syria - where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I am convinced that the main reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy there, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern stomach of Europe,” he reportedly said.
According to him, there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United States, using the Navy, can ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at an event held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the US.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in its pocket because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, thereby making Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow, according to Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I am convinced that we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position brought resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state interfering in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Union (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be 'seriously considering' 2020 presidential candidacy, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would be "seriously considering" a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During meetings at City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top," she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential candidacy.”
Warren told President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“To the core of my concerns about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has openly voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But a poll released Thursday showed a majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center, fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 against.
Other well-known Democratic names for 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Talks About PTSD Tracka Palin at Donald Trump's Meeting
Track Palin, 26, was drafted into the military on September 11, 2007 and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son has been going through since he came back, I can relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” she told viewers at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans that "they come home a little different, tougher, they come back asking if people have respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the other members of the military have given to this country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun in a drug-induced condition, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. agree to oppose new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the D.C. filed an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers' objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons, members of a violent gang," abused her, but the U.S. authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Representatives of states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a high number of U.S. asylum seekers come, as nations facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a decision violates this principle,” the amicus curiae filing states.
They argued that policies that deny immigrants entry are detrimental to the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never meant to be the solution to all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palo is doubling and a desperate effort is underway to rescue those who survived.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It’s very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusum, while trying to sway her restless son in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is precious.”
Residents began to return to their ruined homes, rummaging through their flooded belongings and saving everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake burst at the seams.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spine and shoulder fractures, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palo, where patients were treated outside for severe aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he remembered the feeling when a devastating earthquake shook his hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think the falling ruins pushed me against the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' through 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador accused China of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid China Daily ad in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of wanting to meddle in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s accusation of Beijing meddling in U.S. elections is a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post advertisements in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war in which both sides are adjusting tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade conflict were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major agricultural goods exporter to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his post to the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by posting its promotional ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China is exploiting America’s revered tradition of free speech and a free press by posting paid ads on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in a newsstand on the streets here in Beijing you will find only limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real picture of the diversity of views that Chinese citizens may have on China’s troubled economic trajectory as the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "some of China's most prominent newspapers rejected his offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Kavanaugh’s debacle is ruining the chances for female voters
As many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn it will backfire in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
Emotions surrounding the case have been particularly strong, and a majority of Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
“These things can’t be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, in an article for The Hill published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted a last-minute FBI investigation request from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to reassure angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” in the halls of the Senate as Republicans on the Judiciary Commission decided to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will cross all borders,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say motivation is already high; and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs, and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who don’t like the president but often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she gave details of her allegations of sexual harassment against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a sharp reaction if Republicans confirmed their support for him.
“It’s become a big mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week.
“It’s not just the commission’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it’s how the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Democratic Party’s Priorities group, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be split over who to trust at the dawn of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with favor leaning more toward Ford.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably trusted Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following a push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her when they attended a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new internet to surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that will want to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, called Inrupt, is a company based on the Berners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who is allowed to access individual information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Project Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
Using Solid technology, the app allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and work tools.
It’s something like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, and they’re all available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that only the user decides who will have access to each type of information.
The company calls this “strengthening personal powers through data.”
Inrupt’s goal, according to CEO John Bruce, is to bring the resources, process, and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world have been able to start building their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with “Facebook and Google on whether to introduce a complete change that will completely overturn all their business models overnight or not.”
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in discussions about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Priest Bernard Vann: Victoria's Cross Celebrations for the First World War
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrating his 100th anniversary in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned of Britain's highest military honor.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a plaque on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the plaque was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic struggle.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "over very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and submachine guns."
Later, he rushed across the firing line and led the troops forward with "the utmost bravery", taking out three of the field weapons himself.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something I will never even come close to in my life, but it makes me feel deeply humble."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath at the end of the procession, which led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honoured to be able to attend the parade" and added that "the valor of a real hero shows the support that many people will express to him."

Imagine staying up all night to watch the thrilling finale of Bellator 206 and finally not seeing the main event.
The schedule from San Jose included 13 games, including six majors, and was broadcast live in the UK throughout the night by Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to face off, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig appeared on screen instead of being broadcast.
Some were really disappointed because they were waiting until the morning specifically for this match.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's fairy tale as "some sick joke."
“It’s a government regulation that as of 6:00 this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
“Yes, it was Peppa Pig.”
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they will work to ensure their broadcasts can be watched by UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about repetitions, I think we can sort this out,” Coker said.
“But it’s Sunday at 6 a.m. their time and we won’t be able to solve it until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it came down to it, we exchanged a lot of messages and they weren't exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a matter of government regulations.
I can promise you, it won't happen again next time.
We cut it down to five games instead of six - as we normally do - we tried to give the fans something more and we stretched it.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘less valuable’ for his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to others in his teenage years because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said it wasn’t until he was in high school that he realized “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care less about winning the Olympics.
A regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
As a pariah on the first program with Laverne Daley, he said he felt "less like everyone else during his teenage years because it wasn't socially acceptable for anyone to like both boys and girls."
In his own words: “Up to this day I have really felt inferior and different, and this has given me strength and motivation to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone after learning about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a leading LGBT rights campaigner and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give this “hope” to others.”
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “he was surprised.”
Daley married an Oscar-winning man 20 years his senior last year, but he says the age difference has never been a problem for them.
"When you get through so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - "it's hard to find a peer who has had similar successes and misfortunes".
The couple became parents in June, giving birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole world view" had changed.
“If you asked me a year ago, I would only talk about how I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the idea of death, and one of the last things he asked him was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you won’t be here to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and when he really stopped breathing and he was dead, I was finally able to acknowledge that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
The story was also inspired by his selection of the song - Stream by Heather Small - which impressed him in the preparations for the Olympics and still gives him chills.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form deposed for Saturday's Ryder Cup matches
Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to show up in better shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played for a record 12 years, was ousted by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done many times before in the U.S., the five-time winner has spent the day cheering and tweaking his game in hopes of repairing his reputation.
The 48-year-old did not shoot straight at the top of his career, which is not ideal for the tight course of Le Golf National, where in the long terrain usually faulty shots backfire.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t challenging enough, Mickelson faces the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who has managed to win all of the matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are behind by four points before the start of 12 individual games, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s performance could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, grabbed my shoulder and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has made significant contributions to our teams in the past and this week.
I couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I imagined more, but this is how it crystallized and we felt that this is exactly how we have to do it.
He wants to be out on the lawn, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Falda’s record for the most Ryder Cup games.
It could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has had 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, though Furyk says his presence has brought incalculable values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him and it was great to see that.
It’s not just in his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows strong leadership could soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his own experience that a considerable lead in entering individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at the 1997 Valderram, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but still made it past the finish line with the narrowest possible win of 141-2:131-2.
“I have to constantly remind myself that we had a strong lead at Valderram; we had a strong lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but just like that,” Bjorn said in the photo, after the 2018 team won 5:3 on Friday and led to Le Golf National yesterday with a score of 10:6.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that the game isn't over yet.
We're going full throttle tomorrow.
We will stand on the lawn and do everything we need to.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, that is what we need to focus on.
As I said from the beginning, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but I’m also well aware that we’re up against the other side, the best players in the world.”
Excited about how his players fared on the demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never anticipate events.
We have another fight tomorrow.
Tomorrow will be an individual performance, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with your partner when you’re doing well, but standing up there on your own will test all your golfing skills to the full.
That’s the message players need to remember, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now leave your partner and he has to go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, colleague Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than individuals as they did as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the major tournaments in the last day when he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up beaten when Europe reached the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to the last day in 1999.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but you would like to start as quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum moves in one direction, those midfield games matter immensely.
We created our line-up and placed the boys in a way that we felt we would try to do some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the highest match, with the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the top half of the standings.
“I went with this group of guys in that order because I thought we’d go all the way,” Bjorn said of the selection of his individuals.
Germany's new warship has been rescheduled
Local media reports that the German Navy's newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 as a replacement for aging Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until next year due to faulty systems and a buildup of cargo.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered from worrying problems after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the navy in 2007 will come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will include a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some concealment technologies, such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic tracks.
Other important features include a longer maintenance frequency - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuous delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships that allowed Germany to prove power overseas will become obsolete by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of fundamental "software and hardware bugs" that made the warship unusable when deployed on a combat mission.
Software shortages were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels would be operated by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half the workforce on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is considered twice as heavy as similar classes of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project becomes a problem, including crew training.
It is said to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) - up from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important given recent warnings that German naval power is dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany’s parliament’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy “does not actually have ships capable of deployment.”
A government official said that the issue has been picked up over time as old ships have been decommissioned, but no replacement vessels have been provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust reveals the secret life of bats
New research is underway on a manor in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats are using the land to hunt for food.
We hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow bats whistling and squeaking bats, as well as light-footed bats and water bats in the Inverewe gardens in the Wester Ross area.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to keep track of bat activities throughout the season.
Employees of this organization and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and the activities of individual species.
They then create a map of their natural environment and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a large scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are most important to bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work, such as meadow formation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect grassland and the loss of the environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as airplanes and some chemical modifications to building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks, can also be a danger.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are like eyes when it comes to prey hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to pinpoint insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained professionals who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of assembly points, and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even established the first and only dedicated bat protected area on the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal territory for them.
“Here in Threave, we have a wonderful space for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of protected trees and all the good habitats.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before carrying out maintenance on the property, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one parent site could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is against the law to kill, abuse, disturb or destroy their gathering places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved in helping.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how many of our species feed on them.”
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while lawyers file lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape claims “fake news” and says people want to “make themselves visible” by using his name.
His lawyers will file a lawsuit against the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese man and a Juventus attacker were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers during a live Instagram interview, calling the allegations “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner to the camera.
“They want to make themselves visible with my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
“I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel magazine over charges they have called an “unacceptable report of privacy concerns.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount commensurate with the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, they allegedly went back to the player's room after the meeting at the Ronaldo and Mayorga nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anally.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a “99% good guy” who disappointed by “one percent”.
The documents say Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "scared for retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to reassess the deal as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret' losing car manufacturers forever
The UK would “always regret” losing its status as a world leader in auto manufacturing after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnastone near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could reduce jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW says it will close its small plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers describe as supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on March 29, borders could be breached, leading to delays and a shortage of parts in the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than the daily value of the stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would thus stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "accurately calibrated to avoid these border controls".
“We need to have a deal, we want to have the best deal that allows us to not just talk about the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is the fact that we have to be absolutely able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say for how long production would stop, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the Plant Trade Union, said that its members are becoming increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s fight for the Supreme Court continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump advisers and Russia, and potential obstruction of the investigation by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, Washington has been gossiping for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of using wiretapping to record conversations with Trump and recalling the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, and new information emerged that he was about to step down.
Instead, a meeting was scheduled for Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "rather" not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The deadline has not been set, it could be this week, I understand the postponement to another week given all the other things that happen with the Supreme Court.
We will see and I always like to inform the press".
Some reporters denied the claim: Sanders had not held a brief White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of short press briefings was not due to a dislike for TV reporters wanting to dazzle, although she said "I don't agree with the fact that they want to dazzle."
She then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president is doing more questions-and-answer meetings than any other president before him,” she added, without providing evidence: “We’re going to look at those numbers.”
Short press briefings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to put a question directly to the President of the United States, it’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot, and in the last few weeks you've seen us really often, there's going to be a brief press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
In New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why, appearing freely and several times bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU staff at National Health Service in Scotland over Brexit concerns
The health secretary wrote to EU staff working at the National Health Service in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they would stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of permanent residence applications from EU citizens working in its transferred public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued to move towards the expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very upsetting time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Reed told reporters he was injured shortly before halftime.
“He came to the sideline and he sort of collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
A Tennessee State team official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was after an operation at a health center in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the type/range of injury" and the Tennessee State team is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year college student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
He had five total hits on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a total of 18 hits this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy property in the UK, giving them additional cash to help the homeless under new Conservative plans.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's bid to attract young voters
Stamp tax increases will be levied on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when they buy a property in the UK. The additional cash will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success aimed at attracting young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing and high-income targeted people.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay tax in the UK, with additional funds supporting the government in the fight against sleeping on the streets.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental properties after purchase, could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to get into the housing system.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" for the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new strategy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to more help young people own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of holding property prices high by beating on land but not using it, and called on May to abandon quotas on affordable housing in order to repair Britain’s “housing sham.”
Corbyn announced an engaging series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending evictions “without fault.”
It also wants to give the committee more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my time to renewing the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
This means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, we cannot allow it to be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy houses as it is for the hard-working British people.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the indignity of sleeping on the street remains too real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after moving to the Scottish Premiership with St Mirren last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But as a child I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and that’s something that always drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he doesn’t feel any fear of being followed by such high-profile names at such a big club because he previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town teams.
“For me, success will be measured by whether I can ‘return this club to the Premier League’.
Because of the structure and equipment, this club undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
“Getting there is not an easy task, but I would probably consider myself a success if I could only get the club there.”
Ross is only three years in his managerial position, after a period as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month rotation as a coaching staff member at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and changed the St Mirren team from the brink of relegation to champions the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real fork,” he recalled when joining Team Alloa.
“I really believed that management was better for me than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I have done well, secured a decent standard of living, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but I feel good in management.
I’ve always wanted to drive and now I’m doing it, which makes me feel like I’m in the right place as never before in my entire adult life.”

Analysis reveals that the perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat boosted sales in British pubs struggling to survive, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Data revealed that the pub and bar sector saw sales grow by 2.7% in July, but restaurant sales fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA business adviser who compiled the data, said: “The continued sunny weather and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar trend to the previous month, June, when pub sales increased by 2.8%, with the exception of restaurants that were hit even harder.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant services in June only worsened in July.
Bars and pubs performed much better than restaurants, which, taking into account the same factors, experienced a decline.
Meal taverns have also seen a decline, though not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to get a drink.
Within the controlled pubs and bars, beverage sales grew by 6.6% this month, with food falling by 3%."
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to domestic sales.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales will be particularly painful given ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come for operators to offer food at a worse time, and time will show if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed relaxation."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new open operations, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand introduction.
Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyses performance data from 47 operational groups with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is an established industry standard.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Research has revealed that one in five children, some under 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram accounts”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show to their parents.
One in five children, some under the age of 11, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Instagram accounts” ? a photo-sharing site.
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that they show to their parents, and they also have a private account.
One mother who stumbled across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to rape her.
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged between 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief executive Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online places where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be 'Voice of Athletes' on Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful female athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has tremendous respect among the Scottish, British and world athletic communities and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit by bringing her to the board of directors,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I want to act as the voice of the athlete and I hope I can make a real contribution and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
An American who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has four Olympic gold medals in total, and who is a regular BBC commentator, has suffered a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It’s a grueling job, but I’ve managed to recover completely, I’ve learned to walk again, and I’m doing agility exercises today.
Thanks for the encouraging news!”
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows divides opinions in the online world
The breast milk extractor company has divided opinions in the online world by advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows.
To mark the launch of the “quietest breast pump in the world,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by the pompous music video to showcase the freedom that the new breast pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song that includes lyrics such as “Yes, I suck out milk, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, these aren’t udders, they’re my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “I pump, I pump, I feed babies, I pump, I pump, I suck my beauties.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, opened up controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video aroused mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it denigrated the “horrifices” of the dairy industry.
“A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that we steal their babies within days of giving birth.”

Another user commented: “It’s understandably traumatic for both mother and cub.
But yes, why not use them to promote breast milk for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “Advertising detached from reality.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song appeared to her to be “a success.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a breast pump if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was milking, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I take it as it is.
It's a brilliant product," one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “Fun advertising aimed at mothers who suck milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discreet breast pumps tucked away in bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold babies, and even suck and spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarin, a partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development program, commented: “Elvie’s breast milk extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows, we wanted to put breast milk extraction and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in a fun and telling way the incredible sense of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie has appeared in the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two appeared on a catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move peacefully to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and procedures put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to house children thanks to supporters.
Traditionally, most of the supporters were illegal immigrants themselves, and they feared that they would jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by posing with a child claim.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, immigration and customs chief Matthew Albence testified before Congress that the office had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either supporters or members of the supporter’s household are here illegally, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals," Mr Albence said.
Officials seeking to process child-related matters faster have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained and not 60 days later than the previous standard, officials at the shelter said.
Many will present themselves by video conference call and not in person to bring their case to the immigration judge.
Those classified as not eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape, workers at the shelter said, and reports that have surfaced in the system in recent months.
Advocates said these concerns are increasing in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where symptoms that a child is suffering are more overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause the trauma many struggle with.
Syria will tell US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who addressed the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “we will treat them accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror in Syria is almost over.” More than 360,000 people have died here since 2011, with millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until it clears all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and an "illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were appropriate for their return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" which led refugees to stay away from home.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front linked to al-Qaeda, which "will be removed".
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "revisioning the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will get a second term
With this logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, although many liberal viewers probably hope that his presidency will end prematurely with impeachment and scandal.
That would be the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
So far, there are no signs of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, the average prime-time viewership on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has a top rating of up to 3.5 million prime-time viewers.
“This is a banner that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, creator of ABC’s “President in Order” drama program about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedies and shows “Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has a different theory.
Before the 2016 election, he remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "because he's funny," Scovell told me.
There is a fun value in this chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade's dispute, whether immigrant families manage to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
But it’s beyond an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a group of experts talk for six hours about the “deeper background” as the source of Bob Woodward’s “Fear” book, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich bomber leather jacket (“rough piece of clothing with arrogance,” according to The Washington Post) and the ramifications of thunderous descriptions, eg.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does is reminiscent of a reality show that feeds you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “Pawn Stars” about the daily broadcast of Trump’s show with the recurring part of the show and the daily plot (seducing a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode because you’ll fall behind.
When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 26 degrees outside on the north bank of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was put before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.
“I remember doing all these crazy shows in the past and people saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was just a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money flows from outside into mid-term elections
Unsurprisingly, the 17th arrondissement of Pennsylvania has been inundated with money, thanks to a redistribution of congressional districts that has resulted in two contenders fighting for a seat.
This recently remodeled suburban district of Pittsburgh stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th arrondissement of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th arrondissement.
The maps were redone after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally rigged in favor of Republicans.
Fighting in the new 17th district has touched campaign funding between the party's main financial weapons, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators gave the Democrats a slight head start.
U.S. Considers Penalizing El Salvador Instead of Supporting China, Then Resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little departure from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to remove U.S. diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only taken into account against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development, and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any assessment of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now addressing the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to him, diplomats said.
Three U.S. ambassadors have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new serious news or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying History
Another unexpected event could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on a possible obstruction to President Trump’s justice, of which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation into whether the Trump campaign was linked to Russia in the attack on our election.
If Congress were to change sides, Mr. Trump would face responsibility in that body just as he prepares to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his House members.
That's a lot of conditions, if I don't want to imply that the fall of Trump is inevitable -- not even its equivalent in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice as to how it can affect the lengthening of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, but that would have required the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such inflection points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans now face several of these inflection points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was announced in the report that he proposed secret tapings of the president last year and speculated about his unfitness to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' explanation is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we be voting in the middle of a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will be put to a long winter’s sleep.
I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, she moved to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that swastika table.
With a past like this, I just have to be optimistic.”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feels optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians following an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from presenting himself for the first time of the season, up to a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game and we believed we could get something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have made it to success in the end, but overall the draw was obviously a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we showed more in the second half and were a better team.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the fans behind us I’m sure we can push them and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough given my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a factor in the game why we feel good.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it, we have a great training.
Hopefully now we can push back last season and be successful.”
Women do not sleep because of the fear associated with retirement savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family members.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were talking to their partners about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is the point where you need to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for caregiving if you don’t present your wishes to them in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as this choice can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your counselor can help you figure out a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets if you have that money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in a crisis.
Get a health care officer to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a solicitor for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent requires urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to get you ready.
“It’s not just about the money, it’s also about who the doctors are going to be,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan in place.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he left the house at night.
The victim, in his forties, was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police are urgently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said.
As a result of the crippled communications, humanitarian officials were unable to obtain any information from the office of the regent in Donggala, an area north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggal.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes hit it regularly.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia triggered a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami as high as 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidia Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with the report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Mounted Police report.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the crimes, he took her phone.
Palin remains in custody at an investigation facility in Mat-Su and is being held on a $500 uncovered bond, KTUU television reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said in his defence that he was "not guilty, certainly," the television station said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and get a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, punished with one day in prison, and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother Sarah Palin called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a report of domestic violence crime, and possessing a gun while in a state of intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD resulting from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Tsunami: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power grids and communications networks are down and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that hasn’t been handed down for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck on October 31 to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and cyclists along the route.
According to the announcement, if prosecutors want to get the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injury.
Both of these charges are punishable by death, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, which included eight charges of murder with intent to extort, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s conduct as “disgusting, cruel and perverse.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijo, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last imposed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The married couple had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
They were both electrocuted on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov said he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said they had also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in their hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “apparently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and living in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
During a protest at a conservative conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the People’s Army.”
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians had to “run into an awkward situation” from eurosceptics when a member of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham in March that the UK would “be gone” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in alleviating her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by the remaining Conservatives, who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted on continuing their efforts to reach a deal with Brussels despite opposition from the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the “chaos”.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to suspend the prime minister.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he be involved and responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament told Wellingborough: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to take the prime minister down.”
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight in world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr Bone dismissed the views that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay is completely untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative supporter of Brexit, was also on the march, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The prime minister is unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for her, it’s unpopular with our party and our activists, who are actually tearing down the streets and putting us first.
Please leave the Prime Minister alone and start listening.”
In an emphatic message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their seats as they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must “feel anger” if they betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"This is now a question of trust between us 'the people' and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we won’t let them.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger.”
“We are mobilising the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and we will never give up until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, people marched through Birmingham for a stay and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
A number of activists waved the anti-Brexit banners. The group was founded this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues with the party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have information systems and all the technologies in place for a frictionless border and for free border-free trade in Ireland.”
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “think carefully” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will think carefully about running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall meeting Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was speculated that she could beat Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting at City Hall since Trump took office.
He asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that requires a woman at the top."
Arrested in LSU shooting of Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11 a.m. at an ET press conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man who is captured on video footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near Southern University's college dormitory early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday via the 247sports network.
Wayde went to help his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present, carrying a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayden Sims.
Simpson was unopposed and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter junior who grew up in Baton Rouge played 32 games with 10 starts last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton close to world title after team's orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the Mercedes team's orders will play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start from the best starting position and almost put Hamilton in an awkward position as he defended his position in the first two corners and challenged Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first walked into the pits and let Hamilton walk into traffic at the tail of the group, which was supposed to be crucial.
Mercedes went to the pit stop a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close overtaking in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend for a third time after a double move.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
He then led much of the race as he kept on the road and focused on finishing fast, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and reaching fourth place.
He eventually made it to the pits in the 44th round, but failed to increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me pass by.
The team has done an exceptional job, they have an exceptional combination of two strong personalities,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address directly Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead remarking that what was happening in the Senate had shown people to be “gritty, repulsive, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and that beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
When you look at the disclosures and the leaks and they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you publish this?
Remember her answer... you published a documentary - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, wait a minute.
We published... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and the letter was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t tell her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked me to.”
However, it seems that her denial did not suit the president, who stated during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but she had the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused by three women of inappropriate sexual behavior, the president suggested that Democrats used the claims for their own ends.
“They are determined to take power by all necessary means.
You see nothingness, indecency, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome to gain power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5:3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars claimed a loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning a 5-3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-point lead thanks to Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Thanks to Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie, the home team equalized, but Dwyer subsequently resumed the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, but subsequently gave Lukas Lundvald Nielsen two goals to secure their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men, who turned the score around and defeated Team Dundee 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between rivals, having won the Giants in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came at 3:35 a.m. with Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford four minutes later with Beauvillier doubling the lead.
During the busy opening leg, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt secured Cownie's settlement at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants led the team into the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again tied with a goal during the game without a goalkeeper in a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen secure the lead of Dundee for the first time in the game, and he secured the win in the middle of the last part.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home in Milton Keynes in the following game on Friday.
Air traffic operator dies to ensure plane with hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
The air traffic operator in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died, having secured the safe takeoff of an aircraft that was carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to plague the area, and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving rocking tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed put to make sure that Flight 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower, thinking he was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia's air navigation spokesman, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision was able to save hundreds of lives, Australian company ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were very sad when we found out,” he added.
Meanwhile, experts fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The country's disaster relief agency says that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is likely to continue to grow because many bodies were still under the rubble and we couldn’t reach many people,” Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached up to six meters devastated the city of Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is delivering bodies.
Clean water is rare.
Small markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earthquakes struck Indonesia earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after plane crash in Micronesia
The airline operating the flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia says one man is missing, after previously stating that they had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it found one man missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway began.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
“It was a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through the belt of deep water to emergency exits in a sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve the pier also assisted in the rescue using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data suggests 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but Air Niugini was not involved in any accident.
Analyst sets timeline for night during which woman burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday completed the indictment in a retrial against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He outlined for the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, with Chambers, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Jessica Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is planning to present the final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go before a jury that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive news.
Bristol-based The High Breed claims that hip-hop has strayed from its origins as a political message and a solution to social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and repopularize conscious hip-hop.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are experiencing renewed fame in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York babysitter is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly sent text message from a mother complaining that she is "another black woman."
The couple denies that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that her children’s new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NIEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER ČERNOSKA" was written by Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after the “ashamed” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman realized her misstep, she fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that their outgoing babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Mrs. Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for being fired from work and is seeking compensation of $350 per day over a six-month period for working with the employer for whom she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that they don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple defends themselves against claims that they are racist and defends that terminating the employment of Mrs Maurice was a sensible thing to do, as they feared they could no longer trust her after they had offended her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had only had a child for two months and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a very nice thing," added the investment banker.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, the public quickly denounced the couple on social media, alluding to their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Worried Readers Won't Be Relating to a Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to find yourself in the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that the father was optimistic about the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about a small bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "bitterly sweet" for his death last year.
She added that Paddington's eventual success, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," was quietly proud of her father.
“He was a very calm man and he was not a praising man,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid who achieved something: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, she and her daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me it was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me and told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart functioning slowly faded away and left her system.
She died a short time ago, and that's how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers, regardless of the suffering she went through.
“Nobody knew about it,” she said.
“I had my head down all the time and was crying.
It's hard to explain, but just during the flight, I felt tremendous compassion for Nad.
I knew she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women's messages prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place links to the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room.
He gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that it will have a chain effect.”
Ms. Davis created messages “to let people know that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if they’re a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, the partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Eve, he was on a full day when the kids opened their presents and he didn’t even look at them or anything.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to get through it: “It’s going to create a hole across the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI opens investigation
"I thought that if we could really achieve something he asked for -- a time or scope limited investigation -- we could agree on something," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he was worried the commission would "break down" amid the hurdle.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away on November 6th, if Republicans are not expected to succeed, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators, lobbied to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI drafts a report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Deserters 'Descending' Under Kim
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has been falling since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 deserters last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of deserters from the north will eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, officials from the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on suspended denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work on a nuclear-free peninsula in a broader sense.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was due to U.S. sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way that we would first disarm unilaterally," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', says he is unable to serve on Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament did not fit for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday during the Texas Speech Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman did, they would say she was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mr Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he discussed his family and high school period.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated type of assassination” orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Ms Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony will prove he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he turns out to be biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he’s persecuting the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi was evasive when asked if she would try to blame Kavanaugh if his nomination was confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not just fit to be in the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to be in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she considers herself a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
“Isn’t it time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Well, isn’t that wonderful?’”
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate attack, months and years of rage that can't be contained, and she can't talk about it without crying.
“When we get angry, we cry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She continued: “A woman who was somewhere in charge helped me a lot, and she said that she also cried when she became enraged, but she started using the procedure that when she got enraged and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I am angry.”
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great."
Tears are in part allowed as a way out of anger because they are extremely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from an early job in a predominantly male office, where I once cried out of indescribable rage, is when an elderly woman, a cool manager I’ve always been a little afraid of, grabbed me by the back of her head and pulled me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they got under your skin.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his fight for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended his candidacy, a deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not pursue the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was long since underway, she was behind in raising funds, so she promised not to enter the game unless she earned $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, would only give her $250.
“Do you think I’m on the left?” she asked.
During her speech about not starting an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by so much emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she choked.
“You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said in response to the press.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my gravestone.
“The one who cried?”
How the U.S.-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in the same way every time, with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods having recently been raised.
China has promised to come to terms with U.S. tactics, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to budge anytime soon.
Making concessions to Washington would be tantamount to yielding to demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, a public bow would be even more embarrassing.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic turmoil in one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than we have previously observed,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security think-tank.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugee return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation here is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he does not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe confirms victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating a team from the US with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course near Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, which they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who failed in most tournaments, batted his first shot in the water on the 16th hole with par 3 and gave up his match in favor of Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds and became one of four players to play 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth is the lowest ranked player in the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup tournament.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cup tournaments, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the record European winner of tournaments with a career-high of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I am very happy that the glass is coming back.
It's about the team. I'm happy that I could help," Garcia said, emotional after the European victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Rama, who had beaten American golf legend Tiger Woods with two holes in the remaining hole in the singles game on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup tournament record.
Strange statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the right path, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke to his team after a disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning was a time when Europe was in trouble.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll regroup, work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
Hats off.
You beat us."
Current status of red sludge: Concentrations fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasote
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decrease in red sludge concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Florida Commission, patchy conditions are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, indicating declining concentrations.
Red sludge extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast in the Hillsborough area, but in a smaller number of places compared to last week.
Red mud was also observed in the Pasco area.
Medium concentrations on or off the coast in the Pinellas area were reported last week, low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough area, high concentrations in the Manatee area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Sarasota area, medium concentrations in the Charlotte area, high concentrations on or off the coast in the Lee area, and low concentrations in the Collier area.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier areas.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
