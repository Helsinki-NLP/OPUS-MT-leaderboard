Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also hit
The defender Filip Novák helped score a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonsporu to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2-1 on the Kayserispor field and kept third behind Besiktas.
Attacker Milan Škoda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, who saved himself, even though he lost 1:3 to Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed his excellent productivity with his seventh goal this season.
In the 63rd minute, the goalie of Kayserispor just struck a sharp shot, and the Czech footballer from an angle impaled the ball into the net.
The home team managed to match five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the win to his side in the sixth minute of the set-up when he successfully finished the break four-on-one.
The damage in the start of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after solo to 1:1.
Rizespor did not hold the tie for a long time, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents he remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's duel of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy field.
The well-hidden cave near the hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, there are several sandstone rock formations hidden in the forests along the Hraběcí cesta.
Both natural and artificial.
And we're going to go after the human hand that was created.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In reality, however, no hermit has ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rocky promontory and accessible by stairs from above.
However, until the last moment, it is practically invisible.
It is revealed only by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it is just entering the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be well away from human habitation, at the time of creation it may have been on a plateau where there is a forest, a field.
"The fact that the object has no window and even in a traditional place a fireplace clearly proves that no hermit could have ever survived the winter," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-space object has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used for storing containers.
"I see it as a storage chamber for some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are traces of tools on the walls of the cave.
The sandstone removal by the tipper was quite simple and quick for the insiders.
It was enough to properly use the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trail and the mowing method at all, it is possible to determine the period of the cave’s formation.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the mess that appears in it, there is someone sleeping there at times.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are attracted by the flowing stream and the nearby count's path, you will surely find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minarik is in artificial sleep after falling in Germany
"Philip is now in the best hands.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hanover.
This makes it much easier for me to take care of my daughter, Finja," Minařík's wife Katja told news server Jezdci.cz.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in making predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all need to be patient now and give him time," said the woman of the 45-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won his seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, also called for financial support for the injured Minařík, equalling Lester Piggott's legend.
Nearly 70,000 euros have been collected on the Gofundme server to date.
The target is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took four goals from Sassuola, losing 0:2
Sassuola's goal was scored four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but in the end they had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
None of their goals was conceded by the referee after consultation with the video due to the offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record disfavor of technology, so many hits have never been thwarted by one team.
“The VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no other team.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Sassuola Unrecognized Goals Festival.
Never before has VAR been so strict with one team," he told Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to equalize.
Filip Djuričič's goal was not recognized after the intervention of the video referee due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuričič's next hit and strike of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not apply.
The home team added another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, it was the most in history.
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of the clean technologies department at ČEZ.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car manufacturer Tesla, but also supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are reporting their share of the market.
The operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our network for electromobility only last year," company spokesperson Jana Jusková explained.
However, the editors of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
On average, drivers took 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Excluding small pumping up to 1 kWh, it takes an average of two and a half hours to charge.
The vast majority of fuelling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists already paid for the collection, their typical spending was around 330 crowns.
Electric mobility is particularly prevalent in the city.
All five of ČEZ’s busiest chargers are located on the territory of Prague, and their popularity will overshadow entire regional cities.
Olomouc then leads between the regions.
On the contrary, there is the least interest in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll published in the daily "Czechs on the move", 8 percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organisers, the government’s actions so far on issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a stronger approach.
The event, called The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have long opposed the expansion of the Turów mine, there are people who oppose the quarrying of gravel near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who oppose the construction of nonsensical dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said the protesters' main demands were the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and subsidy systems to promote sustainable agriculture, and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition was placed on Malostranské náměstí calling on representatives of the Czech state to push for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of the Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were provided with banners with slogans such as "The end of the rape pit" or "Less coal, more newts".
Jan Škoda from the association For Water for People came to Prague from South Moravia, protesting against the plan of gravel mining in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned quarrying of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to reviews, it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region for the so-called agro-ecological farmers.
He drew attention to the pros of small farms that do not marry for income and profit and supply the inhabitants on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population quite normally, on top of which they do not do such destruction to the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people killed in plane crash in Germany
An ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in West Germany, killing three people and injuring two others.
Local rescue services said two crew members and one resident were believed to be among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five housing units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters were able to control the flames.
Deputy Fire Chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members were believed to have died.
The third victim, according to police, was a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, citing the mayor of Wesela, said that she was the mother of a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
Near the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on the landing.
Police say it came from a crashed plane.
There was room in the plane for two people.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane had disintegrated in the air before hitting the ground.
Česká spořitelna mistakenly charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been corrected
Česká spořitelna mistakenly charged its clients for some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank’s spokesman, Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were noted by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Last night we made a system update and returned all of these duplicate payments to our clients immediately.
At the moment everything works without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice is not known by the bank's spokesperson, according to his estimate, it was lower thousands of transactions.
The causes of the problems are being investigated.
"It could have been a combination of factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
By the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will introduce a three-step anti-coronavirus system on Monday
"The levels will be according to the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told Czech Television.
The traffic lights will be marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would discuss the inclusion of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have an orange color at present and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also feature individual measures for regional sanitary stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Water and Carolina
When Jonáš the waterman and Karolínka the miller’s daughter fall in love, they don’t have it at all.
Jonah is prevented in love by his father, the unruly waterman Hastrbuch, and Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Fortunately, there is a cub Libor who will do everything he can to protect the village, and especially Karolína, from that vodníky villain.
What if he's going to scheme and lie?
Especially if he can make Karolínka reject Jonah and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the night teapot, spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other mischief.
Enraged villagers arrange a hunt for a waterman, and on top of that an implacable water curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
And now, Konvička's soul to Caroline!
How to soften the old Hastrbachu, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in Czech Television studios and exteriors near the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of CZK 1,000 for all courses of safe driving from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodová, Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the e-shop website is now clear, the customer can easily navigate it.

Payment by deposit (bank transfer), cash on delivery, in cash at personal collection or online via the payment gateway.
Most cases are mild, with only 3 percent of patients required to go to the hospital.
Either the milder form of the coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection wards are half-empty, though numbers of those infected are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized people," Health Minister Adam Vojtěch confirms.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, sampling was carried out by the army, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
The Karviná region still has the highest number of infections per capita, and Jihlava has similar numbers due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer center, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed by hygienists in Černožice in the Hradec Králové region.
The disease has been confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are running, we have limited movement, we have all hygienic measures," says Martin Scháněl, director of the pensioner's home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
The testing will begin tomorrow and the hygienists will decide on further action.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno has today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance that will tell if people have a mask on when they enter.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the company.
Overall, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but fewer are tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote the story, and Anderson was swept away.
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, showed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-arrow leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" hardly reached the doubles.
The way the Dreammaker had it in hand is also evidenced by the fact that distraught Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed very high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th leg, he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was very frustrated.
Rather, he was just throwing away his darts, and his triumphant opponent acted with absolute sovereignty.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of the three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to a Belgian darts player as it is his first major.
Karel Sedláček continues to be the last player to beat van den Bergh.
Nantes Accused of Cathedral Fire, Man Admits
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Suspected arson was investigated by investigators because the fire progressed through the temple from three different locations.
Police also found no signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer in the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating prosecution.
Prosecutors said the man had been arrested again on Saturday and was facing arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a heavy fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present the "traffic lights" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to act as a pandemic plan, the absence of which has led to criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The grades will be according to the strength of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in the individual regions differs significantly, he added.
The Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual stages, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) has called for the creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie television program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening and it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
Due to the increasing number of infected people across the Czech Republic since Saturday, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's approach, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures would come into force and when they would be announced, has been criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main officials should create a sense of security and straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
The measures may already vary by region, for example, from Sunday in Prague, the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential medical facilities, such as pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí regions since Friday.
In the Vysočina region in the Jihlava region, it is necessary to wear drapes in indoor public areas, public transport and medical facilities from 14 July.
On the other hand, anti-epidemic measures were relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutnohorsko region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved a so-called traffic light for Europe, which colour-codes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
For countries with low and medium risk, the authorities do not require Czech citizens to take a negative test for the coronavirus or impose quarantine instead.
They are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
He's playing at a one-third capacity, he was due to finish at noon.
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešovsko continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening estimates, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, 900 in the morning, police spokesperson Lucie Nováková said.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, when part of the music systems fell silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still going on.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still scrutinizing departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of riot police officers, foreign police, traffic and riot police, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today's day, police officers checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of whom got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the technoparty participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) said this on Prima Partie TV.
However, the number of participants decreased below 1000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and it was not even requested by the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (ČT) said on Sunday that the technoparty had been extended to surrounding land, whose owners had not agreed to use it for the technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Fans of techno on the meadow near Hlaváčkova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
Police originally patrolled the meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technicians actually went.
According to Novakov, no one came to Blažim.
Snakebite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The viper bit a 2010 girl in the leg, who her parents brought to the emergency services base there," Mária Svobodová, a regional spokesperson for the emergency medical service, told the newspaper.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Bohemian Forest that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
There is no danger from these animals.
The chance of being bitten by a viper is not very high, with normal contact, she is afraid of herself.
And if she has the space, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
She will only attack you if she feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on her.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened body or suffers from allergies.
This is especially true for children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"After a bite, a person often feels sick, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers can experience anaphylactic shock," said Miriam Gred from Klatovy Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the police officer.
After 11 p.m., an emergency unit entered the apartment and arrested the man.
The babies were immediately taken into care by health professionals, said Markéta Janovská, spokesperson for the regional police.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives or pouring wine at the police negotiator from the window.
He made threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the window sill, where he staggered.
Police are still investigating the man.
No further information is yet to be published.
Stosur gives priority to her daughter over tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be involved in the coronavirus-influenced season this year.
The 36-year-old US Open champion, who became a mother in June, has yet to finish her career.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
“I’m going to stay home, spend time with my family, be at all the little milestones that our Evie is going to have over the next six months and just enjoy it,” she said.
The WTA Tour will resume its interrupted season on 3 August with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: The raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover, in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the inspection of the stand with live fish, it was then found that the seller does not have proof of origin and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians uncovered an illegal grocery store with nearly half a ton of unmarked food in it without any proof of origin.
For most of them, it was not possible to determine the date of consumption, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
In the case of five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, with some of them mouldy, in the area of the market.
Putin phoned Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in Donbass, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is expected to start from midnight.
Putin also criticized the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to hold local elections, saying Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is expected to start after midnight on Monday, be "complete and general" and open the way to other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine’s parliament last week decided that local elections would not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk Agreement foresees that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian territories occupied by the separatists with Russia after giving these regions wide autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelensky’s office said the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing some troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, in the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but in the occasional firefights and artillery attacks, people continue to die on both sides of the front.
More than 14,000 people have been killed in the Donbass conflict since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but a major breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet taken place.
Rykl is an unexpected champion in the decathlon, Novotná dominated the decathlon.
The defender of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the Saturday program four hundred, Kopecký did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
The decade long reigned Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group coach Josef Karas, but after the discus resigned.
Rykl has had two bronze medals so far from the outdoor Czech Championship, this time he was the only decathlete to cross the seven-thousand-year mark.
Another medal went to Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start because the results would have been completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a passenger bag about 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed by the disc, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union's Facebook page.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the seventh round with more than a hundred points, despite suffering from an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not throw a spear 40 meters and did not enter the final eight hundred.
Novotná scored 5,878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It was mainly a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was around 630.
Yesterday my calf began to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on her Facebook page.
Organic LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has an environmentally friendly option - "bio LPG".
However, this is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which in combination with conventional fossil LPG will be distributed to our service stations," said Jiří Karlík of Primagas.
However, bio-LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists now refuel their cars.
It is also possible to mix both versions.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indracek, chairman of the association.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio-LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
By contrast, conventional oil LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation from natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the operation of a bio-LPG car is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than that of an oil LPG car, and up to 90% compared to diesel.
It is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
One of the largest manufacturers of bio LPG is currently the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its refinery in Litvínov.
According to the Association’s estimates, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment reports a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, roughly 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 conversions of LPG-powered cars were carried out last year alone.
LPG refuelling is possible in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
The number of people infected decreased by 1,775 cases.
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers of those infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number fell from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer.
There are currently 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cures is a revision of the data, which hygienists have not been able to update recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had contracted the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered, and 371 of the Covid-19 disease had unfortunately died.
Mobile election or postal election.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for options for the time of the pandemic
According to Czech Deputy Prime Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD), a change in the law is needed to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October regional and Senate elections due to the coronavirus.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated procedure.
He made the announcement on Sunday on TV Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties in the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current legal rules.
However, the minister said that it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law according to which people in quarantine due to health conditions cannot vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the program OVM that the possibility of correspondence choice has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the ANO or ČSSD concerns (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be passed on to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overvalued.
He is personally opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out as early as this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
The correspondence option (either abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
They also see the already mentioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there was a chance to learn how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus era - were handled in Croatia, Poland and France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections have been postponed in 67 countries this year.
Protests in Buharsk: Pigs' ears tossed at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyka Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the “mafia style of governance” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA news agency said.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government staged a symbolic jail cell of Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignations are among the protesters’ basic demands.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to construction corruption on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hadjigenov, told public radio on Wednesday that there was a "peak of escalation" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call for early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has said he will not resign.
This was justified, among other things, by the need to guide Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he switched five members of his government team, although the concession did not reassure the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government survived a confidence vote in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič no longer wants games without spectators
Football coach Bologna Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of the Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
“What we’re doing here is not football.
I'm sick and tired of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, it doesn't bring me any joy.
These games are worse than training.
To play like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so,” Mihajlovič said before the match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Serie A matches in quick succession, and although they are not played until the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under these conditions, you can't even tell where the teams are.
Let's get this season over with.
Those measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said the coach who led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovich, this season is also extraordinary because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
“Despite my illness, the break in the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need to make the players mentally stronger," he said.
We have been the target of cyberattacks by foreign countries, says Iran
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iran's military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said a fire at an underground nuclear plant in Natanz earlier this month may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyberattacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repulsed.
In recent months, Mousavi said, there have been a number of wider cyberattacks, with “certain governments and groups” behind the analysis.
He did not give details of the possible perpetrators, however, according to Reuters.
He added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common during the summer.
An article by Iran’s state-run IRNA agency this month said that enemies of Iran, such as Israel and the U.S., may have been behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired multiple rockets at US bases in Iraq.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. troops have been wounded.
Israel sees Iran as its worst enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA extended production shutdown until May 25
Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroen Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended production due to the coronavirus.
Production lines should restart on Monday, May 25.
Dozens of hygiene measures will accompany the launch, said Tomáš Paroubek, spokesman for the automaker.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. in two shifts.
The company’s key markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain, are affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the shutdown of production in the TPCA does not sign up for life in the city.
“At first, it was empty in the city.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now, since Monday, when it has become much looser.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in residential hotels.
"We have not had to deal with almost any problem in the past two months," Kašpar said.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27 at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants is operating at 100% capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after production resumed.
TPCA currently employs about 2,500 people and represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in the Kolín region.
Cancer kills bride shortly after marriage: Leaves a message to family
Gemma Sisson had been battling cancer for more than two years, and when she appeared to have defeated the cancer, the disease resurfaced.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up on a bed in a hospice, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, the disease died.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she has lived for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions held all over the world.
A 39-year-old woman has been exercising and living a healthy life, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhaustive treatment, radiation therapy, hoping to get well.
After months of treatment, Gemma did indeed appear to have triumphed over the cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time it attacked the spine.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a 10-hour spinal operation and then resumed drastic treatment.
Of course, everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, she was told by doctors that she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where her family was visiting her every now and then, who even arranged for her to marry her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post written by Gema for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been made public, it means that I have finally died after weeks of too much fighting.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
“I can’t thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side all along and given me a tremendous amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all my social media followers,” she wrote, adding that everyone should value and live their lives to the fullest.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and memory
For a hundred crowns, a passerby will get a pocket work of mostly beginning Czech artists.
Pictures and other creations create directly for the artemat, so they know in advance that they must fit in a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always includes a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Buyers may be surprised at what work of art they get.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutková prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell a pocket-size package of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from the troudnat and oracle cards, the second series of illustrations based on her Spiritist comic book.
Health care costs will increase by up to 5% next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic, according to Vojtěch.
Health care salaries could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) said in Questions of Václav Moravec on Czech Television.
The union’s demand for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies.
“I think it could be up to 5%,” he said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, which has since March intervened in the selection of the coronavirus pandemic insurance and government regulations against its spread.
At that time, the insurance company’s income was down.
"A 15% increase is unrealistic at this point," Vojtěch said.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly earnings of a physician in acute inpatient care will probably reach CZK 88,312, while those of nurses will probably reach CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
Data from the ÚZIS also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
In June, trade union representatives said they would require a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay tables, and contract wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private ones.
They also demand that the pay scales be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
Last year, salaries grew faster than doctors.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should perceive how the state is at present.
The Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year’s state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to be spent on the remuneration of health professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the board of health care providers disagrees with the pay increases next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
He also said that hospitals have a lot of protection equipment.
Pavel Švagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective medical equipment in its possession.
He is waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
The state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We are ready, they say.
"The smart quarantine works, it's something to improve, of course.
We'll discuss it with the military tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," he said on his Facebook page.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the prime minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech News Agency that he does not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The military is ready for this step.
The project of smart quarantine was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) criticized the project on Sunday.
He also suggested that the army might retake him.
The deficiencies in the project were previously acknowledged by Vladimír Dzurilla, the government’s IT and digitization commissioner.
“The system is working, but it’s still working.
For 20 years it was created independently and non-systemically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not coming through.
People on the move, poor people on hygiene on the move are adapting the new systems and actually picking up the mistakes," he said.
Mayor Macura of Ostrava will not run again, because he does not want to "fool politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to "not go crazy in politics," he told news server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO movement presidium, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO candidate in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought that I could last one term and with the experience from the business, I could turn everything around and get it back on its feet," he told Respect.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for a second term.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don’t want to fool around in politics,” added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a difficult introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has long been speculation about Macura’s possible end in the ANO movement.
Macur has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for his alliance with the SPD movement or for his support of Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zeman’s opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can make a difference in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is taking care of it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he told Respektu.
The 56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was also the director of Walmark, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals.
He also served on the boards of other companies.
Uber returns to Brno to offer transportation services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, Brno Transport Councillor Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or taximeter.
However, the law has changed the conditions for running conventional taxis and alternative ones since July.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On this basis, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to legally operate.
The city was made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has worked in the past.
He was protested by taxi drivers for failing to label the vehicles as taxis or missing a taximeter.
The court issued an interim injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to the classic taxi with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a shipping service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew up from the fourth floor of the apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a metre from the sidewalk.
At that moment, he was followed by a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window under which still lay chairs and several cans and cigarette butts.
"Ruch, who was carrying himself from the room on the fourth floor, suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men, aged between 26 and 29, for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
The request to appeal Rafaje will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss a request for the dismissal of the head of the antitrust office, Peter Rafaj, with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday.
Non-profit organizations called for the removal of Rafaj at the meeting of the government's anti-corruption board and also the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that an exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to the Czech News Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year and he cannot be named a third time under the law.
His appeal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason for this is, among other things, Rafa’s recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying he would get acquainted with the materials and the government parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said he has not yet met with the president and that he will not be meeting with him anytime soon.
According to the Office, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Last week, IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz reported that police were interested in Rafaj’s meetings with Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the controversial new hospital in Zlín worth eight billion, which Čunek has been pushing hard for.
Čunek admitted to the meeting, saying they had dealt with his "senal activities".
The same goes for Rafa.
The Ústí Region council called for the removal of Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the Office’s decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the Office regarding public procurement according to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened in the antitrust office for a toll tender.
In June, news server Aktuálně.cz warned that Rafaj used apartments written for the company of influential Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) player Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj’s account.
Rafaj has been the President of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, for the second term of the President of the former Member of the Social Democrats in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj’s second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may recall the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
He or she may be dismissed only if he or she has not held office for more than six months or if he or she seriously undermines the dignity of his or her office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blansko library, employees collapsed.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blansko on a regular basis.
In the warm months it was almost impossible to stay there.
It was so hot and the air was bad.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said one of the readers from Blansko, Petr Novotný.
According to Lukáš Dlapa, the director of the library, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun is leaning into it due to the curvature of the building for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to air out the individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We are often in the library at 30 degrees in the morning," Dlapa said.
The study and reading room on the third floor were the worst.
And upstairs, there's the exhibition room and the principal's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"There have been times when librarians have collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe," Dlapa said.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will only be three out of five.
"Because of the limited funding, air conditioning will only have the most problematic spaces.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there is the cultural room and children’s department upstairs,” informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed air-conditioning in the premises last autumn and had modified the wiring.
Approximately 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of that, about nine hundred to fifteen years.
The support of Chicago has driven out the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not all infected athletes come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is silent about the health of players like a grave and does not publish anything at all.
He was one of the few to step out of Crawford’s lineup.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session, he has been absent from the line-up ever since.
"I would like to inform all of you that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last fortnight locked up in my home," he said.
Fans don’t have to worry about their health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into the full load again.
"It's wonderful to be back.
I will do my best to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goaltender has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the goaltender's tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are due to duel with St. Louis before facing Edmonton.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis have protested unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
They are demanding Netanyahu’s resignation because of a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as how the government is addressing the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
Netanyahu, 70, is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He dismisses all accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial may take up to three years, more than 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in Israel, which has a population of nearly 9 million.
455 people died in connection with the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce the daily number of people infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people began to grow significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not done enough to help self-employed people affected by the quarantine measures, for example.
Protesters are also bothered by the government’s sometimes contradictory guidelines in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed his car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out by firefighters.
The tragic accident happened around 23:00 at Neveklov on the narrow district leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew into the woods and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued by firefighters, including cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police.
They ordered a judicial autopsy to determine whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
Stop wasting and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
They cancel discounts and no longer want to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters is nothing new.
Billions of clothes end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
About half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold due to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to churn one collection after another, and at the end of each season, the products become cheaper below their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most retailers count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It’s a bit of a scam,” says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business.
“Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and overseasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is the absence of any discounts typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed," adds Mička.

"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city leadership liked the proposal," said Vacek, who completed his work after 14 days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the United Kingdom, where he received pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to the street graphic arts industry as Camo, has been working with spray paints in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on surfaces that were set aside for these purposes by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrives off the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST tonight) on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
It struck Padre Island, Texas, about 20 miles (24 km) north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the land.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, have been reported, according to the AP.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwestern Texas on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntarily.
The most powerful warning came from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but it is expected to hit an area nearly 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising water levels, dangerous surges, and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm moved around the U.S.-Mexico border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it advanced to land, which again knocked Hanna out of the hurricane category.
Local authorities have urged residents to survive the storm at home, without forgetting the hygiene measures involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for the coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We're not far from it yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places it could rain up to 300 millimeters of precipitation in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, together with the rise of sea level, could flood a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman to lend general rank to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general to Colonel Pavel Lipek on Wednesday.
This is according to the Department of Defense’s expected results.
The reason for granting the rank of brigadier general is the August entry of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the alliance's multinational division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The government proposed the promotion at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the multinational Northeast Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the Alliance's forward presence units in the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Cyber and Information Security Authority (NÚKIB).
The government suggested to the president that he lend Lipko the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Professional Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the duration of an elected office or for the duration of a service assignment that requires the conferral of a higher rank.
The position of deputy commander of the alliance division corresponds to the general rank.
A soldier to whom a rank has been conferred has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the rank.
Lending a rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted.
"Colonel Lipka shows high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
It significantly contributes to the fulfilment of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are keeping distance or wearing masks on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on the planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
Germany’s transport ministry said the deal had been signed by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be enough fresh air on the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed upon by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused confusion.
Arctic Svalbard temperature record drops to almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen is the largest city in the Svalbard Mountains, about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming elsewhere in the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could even rise by 10 degrees if greenhouse gases are not released into the atmosphere.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard can result in the melting of perpetually frozen soil, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming is also threatening the Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Britons who return from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all unnecessary travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of the covid-19 disease.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our top priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that, if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries.”
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Britons are worried about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from their holiday.
Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne, for example, booked a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote, due to depart on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
“We were supposed to go with my whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what’s going to happen.
“I work as an engineer and I don’t think my employer will accept that I’ll be quarantined for two weeks when I get back from vacation,” Hunter said.
There are concerns about Spain being at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, more than 900 new infections have been reported every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia trying to curb all night life to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of buying electricity from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model of buying electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the feed-in price will be lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money due to the construction of electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, as has been shown several times in the past.
Environmental groups have previously criticized the plan.
“The buyout price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to the consumption of electricity - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlíček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people on the construction of Dukovany to earn.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support the so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros per megawatt hour (MWh).
The presented material does not contain any proposal of the amount, it is to be included in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most stocked by traders, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity in the amount of ten euros, it could be a supplement to the average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to a four-person household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 CZK / year," the documents for the Ministry of Industry and Trade wrote.
“We are living in a very turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, CEO of the energy financial group, told the Czech News Agency.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade or by a legal entity owned by the state at a predetermined price.
The agreement between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including a repeated, but no later than the end of the operation of low-carbon generation.
The low-carbon design is defined as a nuclear reactor power plant connected to an electricity grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one-tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit is expected to be operational in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovany bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the construction without interest, with a 2% interest rate.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, but is also concerned about the possibility of Dukovany being built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told the Czech News Agency in May that the expected amount for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the state and ČEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany block will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Regional Development withdraws $2 billion in funding for tourism
The Ministry of Regional Development (MRD) had planned to spend CZK 2 billion on media, internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told news server SeznamZpravy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
News server Zdopravy.cz drew attention to the document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry said the plan was due to a decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, both revenue and media declined.
The proposal drew criticism from both the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, press, on the Internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most of them will be broadcast on Nova and Prima TV.
Printed journals and weeklies would receive $400 million and the same share would be spent on MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of it again private stations.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens, and areas on railway stations or subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová told SeznamNews without further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Marketa Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this ostentatious contempt will be punched between the eyes in the fall elections," she wrote on Twitter.
She denies that it is really about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told the newspaper.
According to her, the budget of 2 billion is indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting, it could be less or more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense in a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion dollars for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Broth of life, a rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album called A Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Frič’s discography, it is the fifth item and, as with the previous titles, the main emphasis is on Frič’s poetry, of which he is an excellent performer.
Frič, born in 1949, was influenced by the American beat generation, but he channeled this inspiration through his own, distinctively presented experiences and also very inner expressions of faith.
But he was far from any agitation, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters will forgive me.
Frič’s album offers recordings of authorial readings from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They were a place of proud and unending bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking ever deeper into consumerism and greed is moving ever further away from what its soul was made of, the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was a longing in them for one who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest to anyone, but who also knew that only because of general indifference could they not be renounced.
The poems reminded me that you might have to lose everything expensive, but it doesn’t matter how you lose it.
If he sells himself out to general decline, he will sceptically resign, fearfully remain silent, or will remain until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamas says
Former Czech Social Democratic Party Prime Minister Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
The chairman of the party and Interior Minister Jan Hamacek only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamacek said this today on Prima Partie TV.
News server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor.
"From time to time we write a text, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamacek said.
However, it is not an official and paid cooperation.
He said the government does not have the resources to waste it for similar purposes.
"There are a lot of people reading his opinion from time to time," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members are still "indiscriminately listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
This is fine, he said, because he is an experienced politician and former party leader, which is the case with Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair of it, he called the sign of this year's cucumber season.
News server SeznamZpravy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek was acting as Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that Petr Benda, the former chairman of the local cell, who is associated with Paroubek and served as vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party, is heading to the fourth place as party candidate in the Ústí region.
Hamacek said he would not comment on the candidate's composition until it was ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Swede challenger
The 22-year-old American stickler has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger than he was last year at an NCAA college meeting.
"We had a battle the year before, then he won and I was second, then we switched places.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen said, as he secured the victory by 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has since shot up steeply and is now alone in the highest pole spheres.
At the age of just 20, he set a world record, breaking the 6.17 metres mark in Torun on 8 February, and adding another centimeter in Glasgow a week later.
"He jumped six meters when he was 18 years old when he graduated from high school," Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that once he grew from a boy to a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
“Twenty years is a good age to jump the world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s list of accomplishments is much thinner than that of Duplantis, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he made it to the U.S. expedition to the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The closest milestone for him is to experience the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name for yourself there,” he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Pan American Games."
Due to the pandemic, however, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other sticklers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere battle for silver?
“Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don’t think that’s going to be possible any time soon,” Nilsen said.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile advantage over everyone else in training."
By the time Tokyo 2021 begins, it will be ready to expand.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son's pension.
She is awaiting trial
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
For embezzlement, a woman faces up to eight years in prison.
Due to ill health, the court stripped the sick man of his legal rights and appointed his mother a guardian who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
"Between mid-November 2013 and January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman had a special duty as a guardian to defend the interests of the victim.
According to the court’s order, the woman opened an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of a vehicle, electrical appliances and for the running of the household," the indictment reads.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son’s money for her own needs.
She defended herself by helping pay for her family’s expenses.
“We had problems with our income to keep the household running.
We never bought anything special.
It was always about things that my son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I didn't know I was committing a crime," the woman explained to police.
He promised to give the money back to his son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930s limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools dates from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a high altitude, has been inhabited for 20,000 years.
So far, the generally accepted theory has been that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
However, this model has been fractured in recent decades when several ancient settlements that were 2,000 to 3,000 years older were discovered.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, found 42 different sites across North America that showed human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them may have come to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.
So far, the interest in tickets has been fulfilling an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also gradually falling.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing every week by up to 20 percent.
The post-crisis development thus fulfills the most optimistic scenarios, according to the sellers.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
The most popular destinations, according to sellers, are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
Flights to Split in Croatia are the most sold on Letuška.cz.
Of the other countries, Great Britain is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also going down.
At the portal Letuška.cz, it was around 6250 crowns in the middle of the month, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to increased demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices have also fallen in some European places, such as Spain and Italy, by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets much less ahead of time, as they fear further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to Kiwi.com, ticket purchase time before departure has decreased year-on-year by about 10 days.
"This confirms the future trend of people ordering tickets much less in advance, requiring more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Kiwi.com vice president of products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently has regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year’s summer season, it’s about half of the destinations.
Big finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It will feature experienced 49-year-old Scottish dartsman Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then came across his neighbor in the table rankings.
He also dealt with James Wade and fought Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent the world number one home, in the quarterfinals.
"Flying Scotsman" barely made it to the semi-finals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in overtime, and after the result 18:16, he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensur Suljovitch 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old dartsman first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, pushed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an excellent series, which then more or less without problems kept to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, hitting an occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
Coronavirus cases rise at least since the beginning of the week, lower number of tests
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was discovered in the Czech Republic for the first time, 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have been cured, and 368 have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This is according to data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 a day earlier, and 206 on Tuesday.
In the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of covid-19, or 63 percent of those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
There are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, 19 of whom are rated as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karviná still has the highest number of infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last seven days, at almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of people infected, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in place in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear masks at internal mass events over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be cut in half from the current 1,000 people.
Worldwide, the number of people who have been proven to be infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
Johns Hopkins University is tracking the pandemic globally.
The death toll from covid-19 is close to 645,000, according to the source.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already has more than 4.1 million people infected, Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, have been the biggest contributors to the rapid increase in cases in recent days.
The number of infected is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 284,000 new cases worldwide between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.
The outbreak is at its peak in populous countries such as the United States, Brazil and India, but the number of new cases has risen in nearly 40 countries around the world in the past week, according to Reuters.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has been reported in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially reported by North Korea today.
The indoor air is five times worse than the outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for your health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This has been pointed out by the Israeli health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be addressed right now, with many people spending more time working from home.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), home air quality is five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year from poor air quality in their homes.
“Because of the coronavirus epidemic that has forced many people to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it’s time to focus on indoor air quality,” she said.
In Israel, almost no one is concerned about the quality of the “home air”.
Dangerous things can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"Poison gas is also emitted by the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," she said.
Children, elderly household members and people with breathing problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside the home, and the material from which the houses are built can also be a source.
Quiz on Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost a chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Due to the contagion in the team, Monday's match against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough points to make it to the playoffs.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruni was definitely canceled due to force majeure due to the fact that there was no more time to play it.
Fuenlabrada took the decision.
On the contrary, La Coruna is rebelling against the non-playing match.
Given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but it is considered unfair that the last round did not take place as usual.
Spain's former elite club faces trial for failing to make it to the third league.
The top two teams in the Huesca and Cádiz tables are guaranteed to advance among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the playoffs.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
Dominika's daughter reveals it
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gotta Dominika, the eldest daughter, told Aha!.
It’s hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in a drawer during the Dark Ages, but if he had resisted in any way, he would have ended his career,” Gott said.
But then he adds that eventually the Czech giants found their way to each other.
“I know that the word Havel couldn’t be heard until he was 60.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter, and suddenly Dad’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominika recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Mr. Havel's father regularly invited him to his home on Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík is also said to have regretted that he never received a state award from Václav Havel.
However, he did receive it in 2009, even though it was already from the hands of his successor in the post of Václav Klaus (79).
Another honor will be given in memoriam, because the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is supposed to award him the Order of the White Lion and honor his memory.
Czech meteorologists warn of wildfires on Tuesday
Meteorologists warn of high temperatures on Tuesday afternoons for all Czechs except the Karlovy Vary Region and also for South and Central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to follow the hot drinking regime and reduce the physical load in the midday and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of precipitation, there will be a risk of fires starting on Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists about the risk of fires applies to Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen regions.
Fire warnings will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant rainfall to mitigate the danger in the north-west and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," the CHMI said.
The Prague City Hall responded to the warnings of meteorologists by banning fires at risky places, which is supposed to be valid from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will remain in effect until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman Vít Hofman said.
