The black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers struggle to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that fits easily into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that track every mile a motorist drives and transmit this information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of financing America’s main roads.
The usually drab design of highways at once sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small boxes to record mileage and perhaps where you are going - and then use that information to build a tax bill.
The tea party was horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to proceed, some states are not waiting for anything.
Over the next decade, they discover how they can move to a system where the driver pays per kilometre of the road they’re driving on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken their black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“This is not a matter of choosing too much,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Civil Service Association, which plans to start monitoring every California motorist’s mileage for the state in 2025.
This will change the way we pay our taxes.
This technology is used for this.
The incentive is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at an all-time low.
Americans aren’t buying as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel many more miles per gallon.
The federal tax rate of 18.4 cents per gallon has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“The gas tax is just not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of paying per kilometer traveled.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometers traveled.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like the idea, as taxes can be used to change driver behavior patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
Californian designers look to this system to plan strategies to meet the goals set in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (a representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees this as the most functional long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation’s free market leaders are also open to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, senior vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also backed by two former U.S. transportation ministers who urged Congress in 2011 to move toward paying per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing sections of the population, whose daily life often means traveling many miles to work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
Oregon is the world’s largest experiment involving 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon start paying taxes on mileage, instead of a tax on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent on trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) are studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept is not just for supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were equipped recently, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
"The concerns about Big Brother-type surveillance and similar issues were a big concern," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something that people wanted.
As the trial project progressed, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to record the daily trips and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers the car will run, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
The company was not initially involved in helping the government tax drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging market for statutory liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device they’re testing attracts the attention of road network designers because it doesn’t use GPS and only delivers a limited amount of information that is regularly uploaded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go for it if you don’t track their speed and their location,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they do not have to take any equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope the cautious public will embrace the concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax device that would be equipped to pay extra parking hours fees, provide mileage-based insurance, and collect other drivers' speed data so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” reads the city’s projection document.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all discussions about paying per kilometer are not just a giant proxy problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-time or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery when aspirin is abundantly enough,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating on behalf of ČSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people and the grandmothers are talking and they are preparing a common approach.
If the Social Democrats fall asleep within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners, who will put a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The ČSSD envoys will then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days on the wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political body and, above all, to force the convicted liars to resign.
He is the only confirmed negotiator for the party, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologised to the Bureau and now to the citizens.
There is no need to lie, either in public or in private.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek said after the meeting.
He added that he is not in the position of First Vice-President.
"I will announce my decision on November 10th at the CCV," said Hašek.
Zdeněk Škromach, Vice-Chair of the CSSD, and Jeroným Tejc, the head of the parliamentary group, also spoke similarly.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
The two MPs then said they would do everything possible to ensure that the 50-member ČSSD club would vote with one voice.
Michal Hašek gave the crown to the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the CSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decision of the party authorities."
Another lie on the air.
Or did he forget, when calling for Sobotka’s resignation and excluding him from the negotiating team, that the August Central Committee with 57 percent agreed that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party’s candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the CSSD made a powerful army of enemies by convening the Central Committee until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with a collection of various gossip and rumors, eventually recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerful washing of dirty laundry, there will be signs of dark alliances between coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka’s wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes will erupt in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka’s ally Peter Kajnar warned: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the CIV had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
Traitors sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning ČSSD boss will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just takes a deep breath: "It's challenging."
The cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what happened at the Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," said the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
They are relatively fast in terms of invoices, not so much in terms of delivering information on essential matters.
For example, we've been using them for three months to get us to know how each village will be officially labeled, so we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating that thing.
They communicate on a number of things.
Has the Olympic Village been completed yet?
But it is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we walked in empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are still standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Just basic concrete, that's what it was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26 as a vanguard, there will still be a smell of glue.
And if they don't, then what?
Do you think President Putin would raise an army there?
That's what's gonna happen.
Not to mention that the Olympic Village = Potemkin Village.
There is a risk that they will not be able to adjust the routes, for example, they will not finish the details.
Maybe they'll make the journeys in such a way that we'll have to bring the boots from the London Games with us.
But I'm sure they'll pull it together.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number is changing.
Maybe the figure skaters will go in the three that went out.
No one has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'm not supposed to be there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things ourselves by the meter, so that we do not believe only in sketches.
We do a lot of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin vows green Olympics, plan thwarts giant secret dumps
Winter sports fans are already cutting a metre until the opening of the Sochi Olympics, while others are increasingly worried about their preparation.
The Russian Olympic Games, which will begin in February, have yet to be announced.
The Russians seem to fail to keep their promise that the preparation and holding of the games will not disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians set the bar very high, the Canadian Games have entered the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s commitment to hold “zero-waste” games has long since been abandoned.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of construction material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
In August, environmentalists found a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foam, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have been defiled and the landfill has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were shown a view of a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one in the area of such places has been created several, described the British newspaper The Times.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is working on the site, building a roughly 60-kilometer route between Sochi Airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroads resisted that someone from the subcontractors had set up the landfill.
The locals are desperate.
According to residents of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months, day and night.
Experts say the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu River, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
“The water from here will contaminate Sochi’s water springs for the next 10 to 15 years,” Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental NGO EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost just $19 billion and Vancouver's $9 billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected when working on an exhibition of sports facilities and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers will deal with a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot of land that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself sloping somewhat.
The requirement also stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
“The three different functions of a house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy,” the designers explain.
The parents’ household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are linked.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the various finishing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped using panels made of planks, the part where the office is plastered white, and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete finish without any further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very intertwined with the exterior.
The parents' household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
It was here that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall, and then climbs up the stairs.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called in open letters for students, educators and the management of secondary schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign carried out by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I have had more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received a reprisal in the form of an invitation not to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were not so brave anymore and made the visit of Miloš Zeman possible: Brno University of Technology, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, University of J. E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now seeing the continuation of policy enforcement in higher education in Pardubice.
The newly elected MP for ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
It’s not the same as being the mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the ČSSD hetmans, who are simultaneously serving as a deputy and a hetman and, like them, degrade both professions?
That’s because you’re telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions on the left side.
I know, we have an example of Michal Hašek, who can handle several dozen functions at once.
This is probably not an example of a person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of Dr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post so that she could fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the position of dean is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of ODS in Pardubice sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
You will be able to help your school without being a dean.
I think that your students will have the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
Consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be counted by the voters at the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long-lasting.
In Kunovice sauerkraut bubbles, chemistry is not added to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut will be produced in the coming months in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season started in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925 it has been producing healthy delicacies in the traditional way, i.e. by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our workers tread a nearly ten-kilometer route in an innings.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, and it takes three shifts to fill one," said Fruta Slovácká director David Kladroba.
The cabbages are transported to the company’s premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclavsko.
The Fruta employees then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw them into the crucible.
From there, the sauerkraut falls into pools with a depth of six meters, where pedal boats dressed in white clothing and boots work tirelessly.
This removes unwanted air.
The last crushed layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The ripening process takes six to eight weeks with spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of substances that promote fermentation," said Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production in house conditions, the individual layers of workers pour salt and cumin.
The cabbage, after fermentation, goes to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweet and sour pickle in bags or jars and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest in it is also registered in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden willing to 'collaborate' with Germany over US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistle-blower from U.S. intelligence agencies, has announced that he is willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander are unable to provide answers to questions about his activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: “Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as defectors and seek to criminalize political speeches with heavy lawsuits that leave no room for defense.”
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop criminal charges brought against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make this possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany escalated when allegations emerged that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and that relations with the US would be completely destroyed,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo on Twitter of him with Mr Snowden.
He was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he ever left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need reassurance that he would be “safe” there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign linked to the persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” had encouraged him.
Citizens across the country and senior officials, including in the United States, have assessed the revelations of an unjustifiable system of pervasive surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “when the hardships of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We regret killings, but we are innocent, say Khmer Rouge leaders
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan argued that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the true extent of the killings were.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan told the court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to "treat or kill people, deny them food or commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
The 55-year-old Bin Sivu, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"She doesn't care about the other one," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she said, adding that the Khmer Rouge's leaders were "worse than monsters."
Foreign Minister of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sara, was also due to appear in court, but he died in March.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incapacitated by the court in September 2012.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, though they said in their announcement Wednesday that passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers will wait with the payment until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We would not like to charge this fee,” she said.
Airlines began charging for their first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and crammed into hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so that space was often lacking in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee really isn't to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which they pay nothing, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said that the website and check-in procedures will be modified to ensure that passengers learn of the charge before arriving at the gate.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee will not be in effect until summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the extra baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost Allegiant Air company later followed suit.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungary’s Wizz Air, says air travel consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the extra fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers were met with an unusual Spirit charge for hand luggage.
"Getting on a plane was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my flying career," he said.
I expected to see gnashing of teeth and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and boarding took place in a flash."
Frontier will also apply fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit’s example.
Frontier said passengers who receive a soda or juice can keep the entire can and the coffee will be refilled free of charge.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but after passenger complaints, it withdrew seven months later, and no other major airline emulated it.
Frontier’s latest move to charge for cabin baggage if a passenger does not purchase a flight directly from the airline is its latest attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to guide passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who purchased through an online travel agency only half of the miles as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she trimmed the reward for miles flown to 25 percent of the miles from that trip.
So a 1,000-mile Frontier journey purchased through an Internet travel agency is a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
NSA not blaming hackers for website crash, but 'internal error'
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website crashed for several hours last week due to an internal bug, not a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov site was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners recorded that the NSA website had not been working for at least six hours, and the site continues to be unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” compromised.
A spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of internet hacking activists claimed to be responsible for depriving the NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers overload and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, which once earned the nickname No such agency, has become the focus of public attention in recent months following a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and has been the target of scathing criticism for the theft of NSA classified files from the agency and their disclosure by disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit falls as deliveries and orders fall
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer updates on whether the aircraft will adhere to an ambitious plan to begin commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results fell by 8%, and Toronto stock market shares fell by 8%.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from “higher profitability” to “sector performance” on Thursday with the expectation that the exchange will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in the transport sector has disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a statement.
As the test program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we anticipate that the market scepticism towards this program will increase.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries will make it to the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight in order to verify the company's claims about the low consumption and cost savings of this airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Senior executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's downtime.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates, and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test planes should take off in the coming weeks, and the others not long after.
Analysts are still skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to commission the aircraft and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests - although consistent with Bombardier's internal plan - is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered just 45 aircraft in the quarter compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which remains unchanged as of 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport orders amounted to 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster about a police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to pass on information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed the drug mafia of a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to pass on sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities to Underworld chief Neil Scarbrough after he became a suspected cocaine user.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" and who was hailed by criminals as the best counsel, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous narcotics cases.
Police spotted Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who had just had dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he sought covertly to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were under surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After police seized heroin and cocaine worth about GBP 1.5 million along with GBP 200,000 in cash during a series of raids, a further 32 people ended up in prison along with them.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to criminals for fear of finding out about his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, experienced shameful moments before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty after a three-week trial of obstructing the administration of justice on two counts.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to cocaine possession.
The lawyer's downfall came after Scarborough's police investigation revealed that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him placing drugs of 60 percent purity under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two individuals.
The court heard that traces of the Class A drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell within "confidential communication".
During his arrest, Ditt took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards from it, but they were all seized and hair samples were taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated an office both at his home address and at his workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters as well.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "Who else is more aware of not breaking the law than a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as counsel and of coming into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation was thwarted as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta refused the offense, stating "If I were a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and I wanted to give Mr Scarborough information, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately."
However, after the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said, "Mr Ditta himself became a criminal when he started getting drugs from organized criminals."
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime groups, which gave him the task of gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of integrity and inspire confidence and confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, which also convicted him of three cases of cocaine possession and now obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 people involved in trafficking were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta had an online interview about himself in which he said his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row block in America, wishing Mohammed Ali as a dinner guest, and citing inequality as the motivation for work.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babis.
The People’s Party won 14 deputies in the elections, i.e. only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
However, they enter into negotiations about the government with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to negotiate the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrej Babiš do not have such a matador on their side.
Perhaps this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
“Experience was minimal at the time,” Kasal said, estimating how this year’s talks would develop.
Kenyan Press Outraged by Controversial Media Law
“This is frightening news and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspaper said.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively hands over “total control of the media” to the government, and Standard newspaper reports that democracy and free speech in Kenya have “taken a severe hit” and criticizes the bill as “rigorous.”
The approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after a September attack by an Islamic gunman at a Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media turned the anger on itself when it broadcast a security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by summoning two journalists and a senior media officer for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of “listing off” or being denied official journalist accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations.”
It is also reported that these measures may have a liquidation impact on what is called Kenya's "living blogosphere".
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“You never know what might happen,” wrote Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu, describing Kenya’s media as a key source for a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back into hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to scrap cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their bold salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, making them among the highest in the world.
It must be done, the young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know what interest rates are.
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
However, they do not reach the regional savings champions.
Austrians save an average of 181 euros a month.
A little more than the Czechs also save people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey conducted by the Erste Savings Barometer Group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of those surveyed plan to put more money aside.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people saving products still use very little.
For example, almost every second Serb, according to the survey, saves at home "under a pillow".
This year, the number of those who save more money per month has increased.
Just last month, 26 percent of respondents put aside between CZK 1,000 and 2.5 thousand for various kinds of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly bill in year-on-year comparison fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is decreasing, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16% of respondents use it, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what the returns on individual products are.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is interest-bearing.
On the other hand, the oldest group of respondents has the best knowledge of the profitability of their stored money, with 73 percent of those over 50 knowing this.
In an international comparison, Erste Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% distance.
UN celebrates new targets to fight poverty
The United Nations is working urgently on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit overnight that it was now time to “go beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realise our vision for the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the MDGs.
Concerns about Mozambique's security escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Thousands of people gathered under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder’s president of Mozambique, in the center of Maputo to shout peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment company.
Fearing for her country’s future, she swapped corporate clothing for a T-shirt emblazoned with “we demand safety” in Portuguese and joined a crowd in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo Party, some of the worst skirmishes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the independent government of that country.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that open conflict will re-emerge in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest may bring in more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and the US’ Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo accuse each other of creating tensions.
The Renamo Party claims that the government has sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in Sofala Province, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
Violent attacks by former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo Party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo Party spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts because it allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a “loser” who wanted to use “whatever power he had left to try to prove he could order the government to make his own decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, concerns increased when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told France Télécom that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease tensions between them, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
Not one of them is a good negotiator, and not one of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which has campaigned for electoral changes, has already said it would boycott local elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the moribund movement to obtain benefits and financial gain from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo Party has been decreasing since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo Party, is expected to improve its position in the election.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza - who is ending his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but he has carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometres away from the capital Maputo, but where Beira is, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended rail use for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
Tales of Thor may show that "gross power cannot equal clever cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
“A lot of the myths would be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk creation are already part of education,” he said.
I've defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructing” authors and teachers are like a “switch off” of engaging stories with “subliminal” messages for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf and who also writes the Penguin Book and the British National Tales, says: “You can have good intentions, but you’d better keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end with a happy ending, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And this must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors to space in a new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can plunge into the new comfortable seats and above their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"These are twenty-one computers that generate images," said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
The digital can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a person.
Another similar facility is the closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to show purchased programmes and its own creations in the hall.
There are two shows on Saturday.
The first one is called Astronaut and is designed for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly into space, turn on the centrifuge, and then see on illustrative examples how challenging the conditions astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called The Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mostly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to the director, there could be 25 to 30 thousand visitors by the end of the year.
We've read 11 THOUSAND ADVERTISING BOOKS!
We know where they want you to go to work!
In November of last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 advertisements (62 percent) on the Internet.
Thus, the Internet is becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26%.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it stood at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example might be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis.
In 2007, for example, nearly 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including workers’ ones, the author of the analysis, Pavlína Št'astnová, said.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies between the two media.
On the Internet, advertisements for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the top spot.
The position of programmers or small business leaders appeared only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs mainly to service and workers' professions.
Of course, the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer include education.
Other areas of interest included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was mentioned in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In only 2% of ads, employers required active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of ads (11 percent in the daily press, 57 percent on the Internet).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of ads.
Practice requirements are generally associated with qualified professions.
This is especially true for production managers and other executives.
In the case of workers’ professions, these are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical devices, the author of the study Jiří Tillner added.
Employers also report requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently required skills in advertising, communication skills have long been emerging in the first place.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
It could be argued that the city of New York is where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chair of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Faye's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden featuring performances by Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
Just as the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year’s festival have emerged from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has sprung up with his sitcom (a hilariously racy "League" on a fantastic-soccer theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but was most famous for her fast-moving series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the sarcastic, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are a product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit down comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting is held at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This town is definitely in the comedic DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the aisle between the two buildings and says to himself, "Man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil fell further to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high stocks were offset by a report that showed a strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil supply index fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thursday was a 39-cent drop, falling 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production spurred more demand, showing growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent, an indicator for international oil used by US refiners, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the London International Trade Exchange.
Oh, no, Mr. Hašek.
We have a unique way of telling politicians not to do this.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Hašek is deprived of all political positions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so low.
Martin Hašek shields himself with the promise he made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Confidence is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics he is apologizing, in politics he is apologizing.
Mr. Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm this, unless you were lying - here you can see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of a man who has made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, flawed person or a lifelong sketch.
It may seem unfair to address only you, but you are the leader and they are the misguided sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand you're trying to lower your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit out the shame and then attack again, but that's how partisans or backstabbers behave.
You, I repeat, are the leader in your eyes, the alpha male, so act like it.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
Court Blocks Orders Relating to Stop and Search Procedures by NY Police Department
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the city filed an appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including a decision to assign supervision to help the police department change its practices and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, by not acting as a judge required to avoid appearances of bias, in part due to a series of interviews with the media and public statements by which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It established independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and supervision, and ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-wearing cameras in some areas where people are being stopped most frequently.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The city's appeal is scheduled to be heard orally sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there have been stops and searches for people for about a decade, but recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg rose dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the stopping and search program carried out by the NY Police Department argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that this will waste money, but will not solve the broader problem of the police force being under pressure after its numbers have fallen by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD police department instituted searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls have low traffic
This is according to Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre will open to the public in Bohnice and will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center relative to the locality and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead places of centers," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle head of retail real estate Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping centers are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in the place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centres must do more to ‘attract’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, even rising in some centres, because landlords were willing to reduce rents and rent some units in the crisis.
"However, it is true that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping centers opened in the past two years are very slow to establish themselves in the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
There is a place in the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room in the market for smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centers', aimed at shopping and services of daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
According to Soták, there is also a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
Both for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or for medium-sized projects, or for expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague, they see the space for the upcoming shopping center on Vítězné náměstí, and they also have the clear potential of Na Příkopě Street and Wenceslas Square.
“The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, enabling retailers to cover and expand into increasingly smaller cities at favorable rents and operating costs, and there is space in some local areas for smaller local or residential shopping centres, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location,” added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” methods to confirm a fraudulent tip about a love affair in which then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey Court that the News of the World had received false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and breach her privacy, but it was said in court that Coulson also called her and left her voicemails.
"The State's Attorney suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the man standing outside the house hoping to catch people outside, but the man who likes to tell people stories to see what they have to say," Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of researching the stories: hacking into the phone, tracking, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, she needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW news reporting department when a source who was sexually interested in Ms. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator's computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects".
During the time Ms. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Intelligence Officer Neville Thurlbeck and former Intelligence Officer James Weatherup oversaw Mrs. Pawlby's movement tracking.
Coulson left her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, in which he said, "I've got a story that we're going to publish tomorrow that I'd really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was modeled after other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
In court Thursday, it was said that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have confessed to hacking into the phone.
NSA Disclosure Increases Social Paranoia of State Surveillance
On a peaceful day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the U.S. consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the U.S. Forward Patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV was hoping to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, insisted in September that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies in order to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who has become an informant, has begun to reveal his valuable collection from secret surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen, they no longer know whether to believe the CEO’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new dimensions.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been bugged for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely leading entrepreneurs are also potential targets.
Snowden has made clear the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I would say that it is possible that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Groen, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by EY, German companies believe that the U.S. now poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
However, there is no evidence in the entire dossier revealed by Mr. Snowden that the United States passed trade secrets of foreign firms to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks some IT and Internet capabilities, and have said that it should seek to curb its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
The German parliament has called for the creation of a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again.
That’s not the way to go, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who have so far believed China to be the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have realized more broadly that data stored in the US falls under their jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable to attack.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the revelation of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says, “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t there a year ago - where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high officials argue that the latest news is just confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It's always happened.
“This has been a major topic for many years and has not changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally don’t want to brag about the countermeasures they’ve taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory drive at the trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is minimally unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi’s board member, says it’s been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so they can’t be used as listening devices.
Germany’s BfV is advising executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on overseas trips because of the risk that smartphones could be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific areas.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington post, US National Intelligence Estimate documents in February listed France alongside Russia and Israel in a second row of perpetrators who engage in hacking activities for economic news reporters, just behind China.
A member of the board in Germany’s risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France’s domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview earlier this month: “The services know full well that all countries, while working together to fight terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia boy who died in freak accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia whose body was found inside a twisted wrestling duchess in his high school gymnasium believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, of Valdosta, Georgia, was found dead on January 11th in a straightened spirit behind the bleachers in a high school gymnasium he attended.
Sheriff Lowndes County investigators concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
“They are absolutely convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said he would.
“They believe it goes against logic, against the laws of physics, and against common sense,” Crump said.
They think it's to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in a body bag," he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a normal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation."
A second autopsy, however, indicated a different cause of death, according to Moore.
“There are a few questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if he discovers enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to order an investigation into a crime or a violation of civil rights, he will ask the FBI and its execution.
A representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia ordered authorities on Wednesday to make available all the surveillance videos that investigators had viewed.
The parents of the teen hope that the video footage will contain a clue leading to the discovery of how their son died.
CDC issues guidelines for schools on allergy in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of childhood food allergies in school.
This is the first set of such guidelines that the U.S. government has issued, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information for schools on how teachers and staff should be made aware of children's food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any.
It also encourages schools to have adrenaline at their disposal - most often an EpiPen automatic injector is used to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, “It’s like someone’s sticking in my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue itches.”
Parents of intersex children can choose "indefinite gender"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third gender for babies born with ambiguous sex organs.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender for such children, and allows them to include gender on their birth certificates as “indefinite” or “unspecified.”
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to rush their child into sex-determining surgery and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: “I am neither male nor female.”
I'm gonna stay wrinkled by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 babies born each year, one is born to a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovary or testes) or unusually developed genitals.
It could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to determine it, instead of waiting and watching the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-defining problems, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,” he said.
Sex determination can be done without surgery, and then it can wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child’s gender develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as distinct from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can manifest in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal allow adults to identify male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person in June, winning a court appeal to retain "indefinite" gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Interior Ministry, German passports will have a third designation, X, for intersex people in addition to M (male) and F (female).
In neighboring France, the issue of gender is still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also delineated the German law, writing: “As the world is dragged toward a new state of affairs where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are reversing two other pillars of civilization.”
A Maryland mother also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the babies be assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without any restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek, who had two sexes.
And about a decade back, the medical community thought that gender was something like a board that could be erased and redecorated.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, saying that gender is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong choice because they don’t know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
A persistent theory on how to treat children of ambiguous gender was put forward by Dr. Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was submissive.
He coined the new term “gender identity” and argued that the social causes and environmental influences - how parents raised their child - affected the child’s genes and hormones, and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged due to poorly performed circumcision to have his child completely neutered, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he switched back to boys and married a woman.
He committed suicide at the age of 38.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfied with the result".
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genital tract.
Doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfying life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
He was sent for a scabbard at 18.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sex development (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to allow his genitals to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he changed back into a man, took a dose of testosterone and had his bust removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of California-based advocacy group Advocates for informed choice, is concerned that German law “calls for branding and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will achieve this by encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choosing ‘indefinite’ ones for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to allocate the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will sound in the end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be classified into the third gender".
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legally valid gender,” she said.
German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a young child should not be fighting at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said German law would “grant powers” to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as a child psychiatry intern while studying at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
“The law will give parents some space so that they don’t rush their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and change their minds, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine - you raise and love your child.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You do not need to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings the possibility to involve the child in the decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender he or she identifies with more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured gasoline all over the house, threatening to burn it down with his family!
The tension increased, the fear increased.
The man threatened to burn the whole house down.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the fire brigade unit from Mladá Boleslav and the volunteer fire brigade unit, went to the site.
A police negotiator came to the scene and tried to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man threatened to burn the house down.
An emergency unit had to enter the house to disarm and restrain the man.
The aggressor then ended up being examined in the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an alcohol detention station.
Firefighters eventually filled the house with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition, all domesticated animals were rescued.
The man did not go to the police negotiator, so a commando went after him.
Report: Obama campaign considers replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the incoming book and reported Thursday night that the president's top associates held intense group meetings and polls in late 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes for re-election.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts made by senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on elections the transfer of former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of Vice President would have.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign's Chicago infrastructure and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former top White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew that this change was under consideration.
The book "Double Down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate list would "not increase Obama's chances substantially".
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I’ve been intensively researching a lot of things, and this was one of them,” he told the newspaper.
You mustn't forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, "Jesus, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as “proper care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments to see if the move would pay off in the election.
“There’s not a lot of money being spent on elections and qualitative research unless something is seriously considered,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about this potential shuffle.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not definitively answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn't know about the research regarding the removal of Biden from the candidate list.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea after reading an expert treatise on jellyfish, and he convinced scientists in China to chemically make the protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the tongue of the consumer - it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream glows when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious," says, "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to making it, we're at the beginning, so for 200 GBP you get about 2 grams of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream starts to glow.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea for a Halloween celebration because it causes this fantastic glow effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because jellyfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each scoop costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
The next product will be even more ambitious.
He says, “I really wish I could make invisible ice cream.”
In its essence, this is impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I am counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late, and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today, I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
For two years, there was no candy in my apartment, and this year will probably not be any different.
However, statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year, most Americans will celebrate Halloween -- 158 million of them, in fact -- and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween is the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are the latest fad of fashion.
Sexy doesn’t have to be just women anymore; foods like pizza, hamburger, and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year, we put our dogs in costumes, and to my amazement, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
You’ll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That’s roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers candy, and Clark bars.
That's great news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual sweets.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like “Terror behind the walls” and “Howl-O-Scream” and “The house of shock.”
In fact, there are 1,200 officially-initiated haunted houses in the United States that, according to the American Haunted Houses Society, make $500 million in profit, and that includes those amazing photos that you’re peeing on and that your friend puts on Facebook, and you can’t remove them, and the person you like looks at the photo and posts a comment like, “You look pretty.”
And finally, a little about pumpkins.
Ever since we were kids, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - we've been doing it since we were kids.
Luckily for us, the “kid in a pumpkin” trend started last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try cutting up their nearly one-ton pumpkin.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercom equipment.
Advanced brakes, service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between plants are available.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The participants of the races coming to Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure as well as an achievable path to world class racing.
We are pleased to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
In two years we will have an early election.
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last ones, he told Aktuálně.cz that there is no other way out, and any government resulting from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible congregator.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the life span of the parliamentary term to be two years.
With the objection that voters will hardly choose completely differently next time, he disagrees: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the leader of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300 thousand votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that there will be an early election, it will strengthen Andrej Babiš’s ANO 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, he will lose his Grandmother.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of part of the party leadership, stated that either he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of the Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
"Leaders of the Democratic Party as little boys go to head of state to enable them to coup in party".
"I thought Mr. Hašek was smarter and more intelligent."
"Because I have never seen something so badly done in my life," added the TOP 09 chairman.
And towards President Zeman (whom he clashed with in the fight for the presidency), he said: “The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over the party.”
The first law was introduced in the Top 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the Chamber of Deputies, including the Parish Register of Contracts, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the chairman of TOP 09 claims that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
Martin Komárek, the electoral leader of the ANO movement, for example, accused TOP 09 of “stealing” the ANO movement’s program with the idea of introducing a register of contracts.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it simply dusted off a proposal that had already been set for the second reading of the Chamber of Deputies.
Firefighters arrived to rescue a lost puppy who was stranded 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was found trapped in a quarry by a man walking a dog.
Firefighters were rappelling down a rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire troops who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a stone quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby fled after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived alone for three days until he was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) with his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the stone quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After running away when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for their lost dog and placed challenges on social media.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a bright-eyed dogcatcher spotted Ruby stranded on a protrusion in a quarry 15 metres above the ground.
A technical rescue team rushed to the site from the Cleckheaton fire station and rappelled down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up over the rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team Andy Clayton said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 meters from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't move his butt when he was rescued - he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The sight of a dog is incredible.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a chance that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was frightened at the sight of the rescue operation."
First of all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he had exhausted himself too much and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are so grateful to them, they were all great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry didn’t make it.
During an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old habits die hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran, and he hit on her.
She added: “That was a long time ago and now he’s very nice to me.”
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's (70) representative said he categorically denies ever making Katy Perry proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe he's confusing it with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers featured on the Rolling Stones concert tour this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another ghost story about independence.
This time there is a warning that a condition for an independent Scotland's membership in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls at Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as expected, this did not make headlines.
No one has mentioned either that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continued inconsistency would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever it really wants from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And it's so old, it's become an excavation, and I heard a journalistic duck saying, "Independence means passport control," at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting idea in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
This is the true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded this year, came out of nowhere and captured nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively sweeping the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
Domestically, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket strapped to national economies through adherence to the common currency, has led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit - that was true only in Greece.
Rather, it is a euro system that blocks its members from favourable exchange rates for German exporters - and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public spending, as Germany encourages.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper cause of Europe’s sluggish performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy promoted by Brussels - the code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not all of the world’s wage freezes would prevent the European petrochemical industry from being trampled by cheap US shale oil.
The result is a simmering revolt, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to position itself on the level of Washington in the world.
Berlin, however, no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and has pushed through its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major by-election, putting the ruling socialists in third place.
With 24% of the vote, the Front is now the most popular party in France - an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the splintering of the right will automatically show up on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
It would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
It strikes me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather turn into something looser in the sense of a “Europe of (sovereign) nations”, favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
But Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where is Scotland?
We can choose to be an area of (essentially) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - that includes telling Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a loose arrangement of Europe if it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, having won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Mature Earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their Caucasian peers.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty is coming.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be the obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter starts growing breasts and pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the American Academy of Pediatrics’ annual conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I’ve spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, there has been little shift in the age at which first menstruation occurs over the past forty years.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first period to occur,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "prematurely mature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops, which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth can be a reason for an endocrinologist to conduct tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunting of growth and stunting in adulthood.
Recommendations about medications and hormone therapy depend on the child’s age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but he acknowledges that “suppressing puberty can alleviate problems with a girl’s behavior and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Understandably, another big problem: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have periods.
“They’re worried that he might get pregnant or how he’ll handle hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environmental chemicals, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz asserts that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climates to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at an early age, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as obvious as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you think," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of innkeeper.
He got a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
Would a popular Czech actress plan to change her profession and start a business in a pub?
Naďa Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and shot beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I did it right away.
My boss even offered to hire me and I could make a living spinning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do to this day, acting," said Konvalinková, who was a guest at the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and sometimes I like Irish whiskey," she said.
Nadi’s long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and I'm not allowed to drink in this new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to stick to that."
Aircraft manufacturers argue over seat width, big contracts are at stake
There has been controversy among leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of second-class long-haul flights, leading to a bitter exchange of views this month at an air show in Dubai.
The issue is the width of seats provided for economy-class long-haul flights - not exactly the one that airlines would normally have preceded, but whose allocated space is key to the efficiency claims of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards to offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but Boeing's main U.S. rival says it's for airlines to decide.
The dispute arose as aircraft manufacturers were competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is distributed, especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side-by-side, is the basis for economic performance claims for the design of new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded “777X” will carry 406 people in economic seats over 43 cm wide spread out 10 in each row.
Airbus says the rival version of its A350 model will carry 350 people in 46 cm wide economy seats spread out over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in the professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of an air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what a new ad war could be starting when he showed financiers a picture showing three people crowded in a restaurant with the headline “Would You Like It?”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus’ head of sales.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but the seats on airplanes haven’t changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 had increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims that its rival is sticking to the 1950s seat concept, when the average width of the newly christened aircraft's seats was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests a 2.5cm seat extension will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seat dimensions, saying it is not the responsibility of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility to do the things they believe they need to do in order to be successful,” said Kent Craver, an expert on cabin space.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
More elbow room is essential for travelers, but it’s a growing issue for suppliers that can affect revenue.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with an estimated trade of at least $700 billion in catalog prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 percent more efficient than market leaders in their latest twin-engine long-haul aircraft designs, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 Concept with 9 seats in a row.
Earnings in unit costs are weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to load more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A 45-inch wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the 777’s threat,” said Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Traveled aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting of convenience, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density layouts for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a larger modification of the cabin by offering wider aisle seats for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unanswered, but may discourage the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded one thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infected increases every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected, a record number.
"There is no doubt in my mind that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
According to him, between January and September last year there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, there were 206 infected residents.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravia-Silesia or 116 from Ústí nad Labem.
The lowest number of people infected came from the Highlands, 19.
Eighty-eight percent of the patients were sexually infected.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV and passed on to them from their mother.
“Gravity is nonsense, but the spectacle is beautiful,” experts say.
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity sold out some time after its premiere in the Czech Republic.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, he was seen by almost 150,000 viewers in October and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the image positively.
However, there are some discrepancies in it.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (Director of Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film is called Gravity, even though it looks like a “physically real” performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You may notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which does not float in a weightless state.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in vastly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in the same frame.
Some viewers of the film reproach the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of fire in weightlessness.
According to them, the suits would not withstand such blows.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without much difficulty endure everything.
Criticism was not spared even the plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth orbit is, according to some, unrealistic.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the tech.
People also argue on forums about the "unreal" behavior of ropes.
It looks like it’s meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Groen (Director of the Prague Observatory and Planetarium): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can definitely say I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the discrepancies you mentioned affected me, how the space station is shown three times with a degrading level of technology (lastly Chinese)."
“China won’t be until the end of the decade, and it’s probably going to look better than it is in the movie.”
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate the laws of physics, and so the science-oriented viewer will appreciate that the angular momentum of various cosmic collisions and collisions is quite correctly preserved, in the words of the physics dictionary, the view of the Earth from space is also very realistic, including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurnal radiance of the polar region.
Irregularities will certainly be found on closer examination.
In addition, while reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space debris in orbit appears to be reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the filmmakers have adapted to their needs, but I have not noticed any fundamental and sky-high transgression against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar orientation, the filmmakers have taken care of the credibility of the events depicted.
Of the moments that don't make sense, it's worth noting that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a slanted orbit other than the ISS.
As a result, the speed of each other is very different and the rescue operation could not actually have taken place as depicted in the film.
Further, at the moment of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS rotated, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect a mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, more tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first signs are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to form a steady stream of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In tests of vaccinated mice that were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren’t vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine has gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given so often to maintain sufficient antibody levels that they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they feel like trying a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
Smokers are more likely to quit.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get any benefit from it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the state corruption oversight committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied that he would change the coastal lease policy at the request of his political advisor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled property.
The Independent Committee Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday extended its search to whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, reinstated without having to participate in the tender after its expiration in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating claims that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy office manager, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for lettings to go to public tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, the leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rental policy.
A transcript of the calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August through September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the subject of the conversations during these phone calls a development in commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
This official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the targets were Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on missile shipments in Syria.
Many things have moved, and they are different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman of Štěch was stirring up discord.
Mr Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the ČSSD’s misery.
The rest of them showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, Vice-Chairman Zaorálek was made impossible by the most interview on television.
Based on this, I do not see a better option than for the CSSD to propose Vice-President Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one that would not have an initial handicap and I think it would do a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone from the management supports it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajdůšková could without fear form a minority government with only a blessing from the Prime Minister Babiš and without the people, but with the People’s Health Minister Hovorka, who is actually a religious Social Democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability because it would push for a proper referendum law, and that is what Úsvit Okamura has pledged to support.
Chairman Babis would eventually accept the tax progression, because he is smart and will see that it cannot be done without her.
Peoples would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in the government.
The same is true of ANO, there would be a valuable minister, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into risky government participation, but provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajdůšková the courage!
Foreign workers with a visa permit may undergo a “legality” test
As the government intends to expand police action, it is considering a “permission” test for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
"The loud statements of 'foreigners at the end of the line' and 'work first for Australians' are very unpleasant remnants of a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce was to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region recorded an echo of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he is negotiating with officials over people smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants can be examined in detail whether “the nomination is warranted in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring business.”
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also be required to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Once Phase Two is completed, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which has been in talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, has tasked HS2 with finding out more rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London of three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is enormous.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it’s also about connectivity: 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "clearly" support Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed rail has the potential to bring immense economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland's overall case of high-speed rail across Britain."
We are excited to work with the UK Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to bring benefits to all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh route, which the Scottish Government is planning to do anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers over the next year and to taking the next steps together.
Together with Bárta, an anti-corruption police analyst was arrested
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when news server Prvnízpravy.cz reported.
MF DNES soon found out that the General Inspection of Security Forces (GIBS) was in charge of the case and that its people were supposed to arrest Bárta in the centre of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police, Jan Petržílek, is among the arrested.
He previously worked for the Security Intelligence Service.
However, anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej declined to comment on the information, adding that the media had to turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even its spokesperson Radka Sandorová did not want to say anything about the case, she immediately referred to the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Czech Public Prosecutor's Office.
Also, from this inconclusive reaction, it can be inferred that the event took place, but it is in a secrecy mode that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
Bart’s lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "in this matter as well," but since the information was classified, he could not confirm or deny Barta's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart’s arrest could be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
This was promoted by Bárta together with former VV chairman Radek John, who sat at the head of the Interior Ministry.
Even then-president Václav Klaus had to deal with the dispute that flared up between ex-premier Petr Nečas and VV over this.
I don’t know where that connection came from for me.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
“I don’t really know anything about it,” said Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became Chief of Police.
Officially, he was promoted by Radek John, the real leader of the party, but he was Barta at the time.
Bárta was now running for election for the Úsvit movement, having narrowly missed the parliamentary mandate by 175 votes.
Dawn's leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate list and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not nor is he a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he distanced himself from Bárta Okamur, who said before the elections that he gave Bárta the opportunity to run for Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the bailiffs.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former colleague Jaroslav Škárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing despite changes in the U.S. to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight as long as the devices remain in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they have no plans to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had reviewed the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“The CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on an aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, was in favor of the change, but announced that they would be subject to a decision by the regulator.
“We would welcome CASA to do an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have [wireless on-board entertainment],” he said.
Qantas has announced that it will adhere to current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change that anytime soon,” he said.
FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
But we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that can be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it thoroughly.
For U.S. air carriers, the impact of regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training material, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“Once the airline has confirmed its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, passengers are instructed to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stowed under the seats or in overhead storage during takeoff and descent.
With rising middle-class poverty, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
In a pawnshop in Singapore, Bendemeer stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money on it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 (3,000 SGD) each month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is inadequate, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is such that ValueMax, where the woman makes her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash - 1300 SGD in Mrs. Amirthaling's case - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawn shops in Singapore routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require verification of a person (payment history) or proof of income, and they can provide a loan faster than banks.
As families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of home loans primarily due to rising rents as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia, she said.
Malaysia is at the top with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about Thailand’s high level of consumer debt, which has just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scale] will try to top up their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people rushing to pawn their personal possessions and seize the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 urban pawnshops are gold.
People say, the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawnshop industry is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar branches in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also beyond Asia, says ValueMax CEO Lee Ching.
The company will fund it using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Mrs. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly raise debt.
“Customers are stopping items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” he says.
In society, the pledge of property is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, it is not only people in financial distress who use pawnshops.
Wealthy Singaporeans also take advantage of ValueMax when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, which can reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come from all possible backgrounds.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short-term borrowing because of their daring trades or investments, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Mrs. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
$325 million rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania includes tough conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking “urgent measures” to avert the crisis caused by the island’s aging population, higher rates of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for the four-year term was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgery at the patient's request.
A further 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help eliminate debt.
The money goes to free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, health specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are responding to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian healthcare system,” said Plibersek.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and record-keeping obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Australian Union, and report monthly where additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said $325 million would be of no use “until real reform follows to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania’s public health system”.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for expedited assistance, which he first raised in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal relief package can extricate the state's public health service from critical condition," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Peter Dutton, a spokesman for the federal health opposition, believes today’s announcement is just a “patch.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian union that donates 300 million dollars, and pretend that's good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novella, which brings an exceptional cinematic journey and portrayal of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in France in the 1860s, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a convent.
When she rebels, she experiences extreme cruelty from a reprehensibly depraved mother superior, and for another she becomes an object of sexual passion.
The film never slips into lechery or sensationalism, and that's his problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that the audience will also experience torment similar to wearing a horsehair shirt.

Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production facilities, says watchdog
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Oversight Committee said on Thursday, while fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the locations where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before November 1,
The deadline set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and machinery for chemical mixing for the purpose of creating poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the town of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and a repository, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
The list includes 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
Among those killed are 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting insurgents in Safira, many of whom are associated with al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observatory said Thursday that losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have to deal with tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said his team is now "satisfied to have verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria's declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling."
He added that "no further monitoring activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “left behind and ... the chemical weapons program items it contained have been moved to two other declared sites that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,” Ahmet Uzumcu, the OPCW’s director of observers, said in a statement.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam, are facing each other in a civil war.
In terms of further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a strong explosion inside an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Wrath over sentence handed down over plotter of Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the sentencing of the last of the plotters brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for assembling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular Kuta tourist area, leaving 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life in prison, although it could have insisted that a man nicknamed "Demolition man" be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other plotters nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
She told the AAP news agency, Mrs. Corteen, "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a powerful charge placed outside a parked van was detonated shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while being kept alive, he "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said Patek should meet the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the massacres of Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and wounding hundreds more isn't much.
Patek was the last person to stand trial in Bali.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later, US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to reestablish links between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't give up willingly," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for the grief he has inflicted on others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“We’re going to see a lot of tears this year,” said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air Passengers Now Allowed to Use Technology Advancements on Planes (But Not Allowed to Call from Their Mobile Phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from gate to gate" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA how well their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the cabin crew training manuals and stowage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already passed the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors close.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane goes down to land, and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are safely in place - and we will work closely with transport companies - it will be a success," Glading said in a statement.
Honestly, we are tired of looking like “guardians.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and sms, and downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored due to concerns that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Committee on Telecommunications.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transportation security expert at CBS News, said cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference to broadcast towers in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee created by the FAA administration to investigate the issue last month proposed that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no valid security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the jamming of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios with them, a technical achievement of the time.
The new airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations' aircraft, but they are also constructed, and approved by the FAA, to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering travelers to use Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio transmissions than those of previous generations.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to ease restrictions on passengers’ use of these devices is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the airliner with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believes the interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members have stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause interference to aircraft systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device during low-visibility flying.
The travel industry group welcomed the changes and said it was a sensible approach for a travelling public that uses the technology extensively.
"We are delighted that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was flown from a drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into the wild.
The bird was brought to shore after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One rattle was flown to Aberdeen by helicopter last month after being treated by Scottish company SPCA at a rescue centre until he recovered.
Colin Seddon said: “This rattle probably migrated from northern Europe when a strong wind picked it up over the North Sea.”
He seems to have run out of power and found refuge on an oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help."
By the time he was released, he was in good shape and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to bring businesses together and define what changes British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey to ask UK business leaders about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and across sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government favor new trade ties with countries like China, India, and Brazil rather than get bogged down in a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulations to product laws - most entrepreneurs expressed the view that scrutiny of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was widespread dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European business sphere, with even 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreeing.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling knowledge, namely that an overwhelming majority wants Britain to seek a treaty change and a relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, shared by businesses of all sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for “meaningful change” that will bring influence back to the UK.
The stakes are high - achieving a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum vote for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift away from the current balance of power back towards Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a journey beyond a closer economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority and, as our survey results show, for business this means a refocus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory approach.
John Kerry admits spying has gone too far
The U.S. has sometimes gone "too far" in spying, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, the collection of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington" was made amid heated controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency, which also targeted U.S. allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did the president, some of these actions have gone too far and we make sure that doesn't happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the practice so far.
The collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the London attacks in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to be informed of the plot in time," Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone too far".
The affair over US intelligence, which allegedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The launch of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, Gazprom's director said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the riskiness of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
As soon as the project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin in other countries towards the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamoun.
According to increasingly accurate reports, Israel destroyed rockets destined for Hezbollah in Wednesday’s airstrikes in western Syria.
The Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting on the side of the army in Syria.
Its program is also to fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of armaments to Hezbollah's hands in Lebanon.
Reports of Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria on Wednesday are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by US sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snubar Jablah south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station said two warehouses were hit, where missiles were ready to be transferred to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of Hezbollah's armed section how to handle missiles.
The SA-8 is an obsolete missile that has been used by the Syrian army since the 1980s.
They are located on a moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, they are easy to hide due to their mobility and small size.
They are equipped with radar, which shuts down after firing the missile, making them difficult to target.
Latakia is located in western Syria, an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he is helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which Alawites belong.
Now 15,000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help retake the army of Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamoun is located between Damascus and Homs, the country's third largest city.
According to al-Arabiya, the battle is intended to be a retribution for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade Abu Fadel Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight back the city of Qusayr near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Qusayr went to Kalamoun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, spending on overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
Based on the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this state of affairs.
That they did not really mind, and with the state that was here (the theft and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise I cannot explain that 3 413 497 voters did not attend the elections, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted ODS in total 4 394 028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is a vast majority.
If I add 1,016,829 ČSSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all the above-mentioned parties participated in the "robbery" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not in favour of robbing and over-indebtedness of this state to punish the guilty.
Or do you think that members of the ČSSD, who participated in it, will push for appropriate laws?
Is there any help at all?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) have been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that two employees of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse before charges were filed against child educator Jonathan Lord from the city of Caringbah in 2011.
But the committee said in its opening statement to the committee that the association had never addressed a case of child sexual abuse in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the YMCA employees was charged with misdemeanors related to child pornography, and another in which a gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted of sexual harassment of children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, a consultant to the commission, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was also inaccurate, stating that external audits were being carried out at the YMCA, which praised the organization as a leading advocate for children's rights.
Evidence presented by the commission indicates that the YMCA was alerted to receiving the second lowest of the four possible assessments in an audit of the Ministry of Education and Society in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from himself downwards had failed to accept Mr. Lord without making sure the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually molesting 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr Hare denied claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child safety breach to Mr Lord.
Staff members gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including the Lord being alone with the children, keeping them private, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lorde's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lorde's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to".
The CEO said he does not accept evidence from staff that they felt uneasy to contact their superiors and report the actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the New South Wales YMCA board that the lesson of the "Jonathan Lord case" for the organization was that the staff had "not filed a report", and the board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged made General Manager for Child Services at the YMCA Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid distorting the evidence, but it was “overzealous” and poorly done.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, integrating, training and leading the staff.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a late-night interview marking the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talking about British politics, restricting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, the Evening Standard of London quoted him as saying, “Yes, of course, but it’s going to be hard, isn’t it, so...”
While a crowd of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
No one was ready for Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his animal pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, slipped through three laps smoothly to eventually win the grand prize, leaving behind 30 trailing adult rivals.
At the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff, this inseparable pair - with the same height - were praised for their looks, manners and style.
He stood up to gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and had his two-year-old Toffee paraded around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horse, far exceeding his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee work well together.”
They didn't have high hopes for each other, but eventually they left with a golden cup and bouquet.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought of him as phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showcasing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded.”
He ran on the sand all along the length of the arena, and although he seemed so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and he was in charge of two chickens.
Given how he started, he'll be back at Horse of the Year again soon, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said, "The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their outstanding speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always see how good teamwork is between the pony and the one who leads it - and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the cute clothes, he really fit in with it.
Overly inquisitive newspapers should be investigated
Chinese newspapers that have asked for the front page to release a reporter accused of defamation will be thoroughly investigated, the newspaper's administrator told the press.
The Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction".
The “correction” order came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about the Zoomlion company.
"The editorial leadership of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of the journalist's license".
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to publishing false stories in exchange for a bribe.
“In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion, as well as to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realize I've done wrong.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, a front-page New Express newspaper issued an apology in which he stated that he had failed to perform sufficient scrutiny of his messages.
Several high-profile suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still being coerced on a regular basis, despite a change to a law this year that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A tunnel for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico with its own railroad has been found
One of the most sophisticated drug-trafficking tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric railway.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, roughly one metre in size, as one of the most sophisticated secret passageways ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds up to the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and in San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be brought in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
The three men, who are believed to have worked as drivers, have been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of a conviction, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers break into extensive drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico, which poses a problem for drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor some 650 meters long, equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Economia and the Center connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Center have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and personnel union is essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," comments Kamil Čermák, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economia and the acting CEO.
Čermák, who will lead the unitary management, will be joined by Andreas Demuth, CEO of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Voparil has been appointed as the new joint director of the business, and Zuzana Tylčerová, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinated to him.
Štěpán Burda became the new head of information technology.
The joint director of the editorial offices is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes Jakub Unger, Director for Transformation.
Adéla Pittsová was appointed as the newly established director of marketing.
Věra Lhotská is newly managing the separate corporate communication unit.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, the human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the content creation of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly increase the effectiveness of the company's business management," added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into an agreement to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly Respekt and Ekonom, and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CME is targeting the TV business.
They're gonna lay off almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to lose a thousand people.
Okekat intends all the ancillary activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates televisions in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is a company CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting television stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for TV Nova, the domestic TV number one, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we can't really comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, Nova's director of communications.
According to MF DNES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
The two new Nova bosses, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined after longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke to analysts during a conference call on Wednesday about wanting to curtail all activities not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
A cooling tower burned down at night in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague
A large-capacity storage tank was burning in the ČKD industrial complex in Prague, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters were going to the fire before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and this morning they were still putting out the fire," said Pavlína Adamcová, spokesperson for the Prague fire department.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the environment, according to measurements, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
Around 50 firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolbenova Street compound.
"This is a large-capacity tank fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we use transport lines from tankers," she added.
According to news server tn.cz, a poorly functioning network of fire hydrants complicated the extinguishing, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire chief has declared a second level of fire alarm.
There are four levels, with the fourth being declared in the most serious situations.
Chemists also went to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air in a fire.
"However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a spokeswoman for the fire service said.
British police give Assange extradition notice
British police today delivered the extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a "delivery notice" to the 40-year-old asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he could be arrested.
Assange ran out of options under the British law when the Supreme Court overturned his extradition appeal earlier this month, facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the U.S., he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy in London on June 19, where he sought asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered the extradition notice to a 40-year-old man, asking him to come to the police station at the day and hour specified for him," a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the release notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage after posting 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined 1,000 pounds for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The motorist was fined 1,000 pounds for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found that he had a cup with a drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to the charge of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the costs of the 90 pounds and a surcharge for the accused of the 100 pounds.
The London bubble is bursting as a result of the tax on foreign property owners
The Ministry of Finance has tentatively assessed the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who introduced a 7% property transfer fee for buildings worth over 2 million pounds and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals, in the 2012 budget.
The proceeds from the property transfer fee in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea counties, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceed the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said, "Given the increase in real estate transfer for high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are undertaxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that “this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or to be reluctant to sell it to existing owners.”
Leading properties - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in a rich swath that extends from Fulham to Wimbledon saw an increase of a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but have been eclipsed by a booming “home market” in which, according to a survey by real estate firm Savills, there has been growth in the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%).
Scientists shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog's mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs wag their tail mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.”
We have seen the same thing in other species.
He added that, as with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information on how dogs respond to the disproportional wag of other dogs' tails, the researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed dogs films about dogs - either in the natural version or in silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and depict it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw the otherwise bland dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), it remained completely calm.
However, when she noticed the tail turning mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals felt insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they need to watch out for.
He said, “If you meet dogs several times and moving their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior, and moving to the right breeds less friendly behavior, you’ll react based on that experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animals’ emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a college veterinary teacher at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another scholarly treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said: “Dog robots were more likely to be introduced to dogs when they were wagging their tail to the left than to the right, when they were more likely to be insecure than in an Italian study.”
The difference, he said, could be that dogs in these different studies didn’t interpret animals in movies or dog robots quite like dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help.
"Although there is strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes in the case of many different mammals, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail goes to one side and another to the other.
Arctic Monkeys Delayed Concert in Glasgow Due to Alex Turner's Illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the gig in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform Friday at the city's Hydro complex.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to reschedule.
The announcement came after the group was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and based on medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, 1 November.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to perform."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
We would like to apologize to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience this caused.
If you need more information, please contact customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets.
Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are the ones electing the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - the group thus shrinks to 120 electing cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there would be a gathering of current cardinals known as a consistory before the solemn elevation of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to drop by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to bring the number of electors back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election for cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that the pope would seek the cardinals’ advice.
We have not been in this situation before - it is absolutely new.
Valero said the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he's naming."
GM recalls some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backs
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. auto safety authority, General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a malfunction with the backrest tilting manually.
On some of these vehicles, the mechanism for tilting the front seats may be defective.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if a car gets hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, which increases the risk of injury.”
Downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the van in June, making it the most important launch for the U.S. automaker from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owner of the van about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA could not review the announcement to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that weakened growth in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were revised for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Cry of the Obama Voter
I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts have thwarted the obstructions of the Republican Party
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of Obama’s health care website or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would cheer me up and restore a bit of hope to me during the grim days of my sophomore year at medical school.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s a reminiscence of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming predominance, and the television news force us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept the newspaper they got.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82 percent support.
This is where I close the book.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic days - they seem like distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw in my first ballot, there really were changes.
It was definitely not what I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the “don’t ask, don’t say anything” policy after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party’s obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among other things, immigration reform, public choice of health care, and the closure of the Guantánamo base.
But after many situations of defending the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have come to an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I find myself in a place of political despair.
Republican obstructions cannot explain consent to wiretapping foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by the National Security Agency collecting data on Americans’ private lives, nor by the fact that it persecutes those who expose the government’s wrongdoing.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without due process, or for curtailing public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they cannot even excuse the inability to create more than 3 years after signing the Affordable Care Act simple website.
I don't know if such a thing was to be expected.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
Obviously, the election process is not predictable, and our public talks will be shaped by opposition political parties and random events such as the Newton Massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confused and unpolished alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free of the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet a return to 2008 - as Obama's support has fallen below 45% this week - is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat in the Pennsylvania primary with Clinton.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and stay true to their mission.
“I want my magic back,” he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict over parental leave program
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is waging a dispute over a $6 million coal tax bill, made the claim when he tried to dismiss the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which plays a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
“He’s got a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the struggle for the Fairfax district of the Sunshine Coast with 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the polls close?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, type the details into the computer, vote immediately, and have the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, can the results be erased if someone doesn't like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently released a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also applied to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job "very seriously".
A public office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your mood.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were designed to solve an insoluble task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the failure was much more optimistic than the group that didn’t wash their hands.
Also, the "washed hands" group performed better in the next test than the other.
Still, those who washed their hands scored worse on other tests than those who didn’t.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not notice any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that body cleanliness eliminates really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation decreases, and testers need to focus much more in future tests.
If we passed on the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs do not wash their hands, but after the journey by public transport, it is already a fifth.
They also tend to stick to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
A pet’s caress motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks that it is necessary to wash their hands after shaking hands with a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about 10 times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid that the reality is different and people are trying to do a bit better," said skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
RBS Suspends Two Foreign Currency Dealers
According to two persons familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that a global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is becoming more common.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed it had received a request for information from authorities this month.
“Our ongoing search continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other agencies,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had handed over to the British Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European Chair of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European head of cash trading at Citi, took a vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged with any misdemeanors.
Mr. Usher's IM group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people privy to the event said.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced it was investigating suspicious foreign-currency manipulations in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust agency Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are examining claims that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the relevant authorities.
Banks are combing through years-old instant messages and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest profit-making engines in investment banks’ closings in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the low volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by arguing that a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this is not necessarily true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of day-to-day foreign currency trading, splitting up liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a trader from its stock trading department this week, causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
“We believe that this trader acted alone and that this issue has been resolved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the follow-up in 1986 until the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National AIDS Reference Laboratory of the National Institute of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infections in the Czech Republic so far.
Immunity failure has already started in 396.
198 people were killed.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected, and in 2010 180 new infections were detected.
Last year the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt in my mind that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
Between the start of the follow-up and the end of September, 1,710 men and 353 women were tested for HIV.
The AIDS epidemic affected 161 men and 37 women.
Most of those infected were in Prague.
Anyone who wants to get to know a city should head to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through a crowded center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the Bedeker would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves".
Slowly, cemeteries wander and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities they are, what beliefs they belong to, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their tastes are.
And they will find out how the dead are being cared for.
Supreme Court backs Obama's health care bill
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual patient protection and affordable care law - which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise they are at risk of paying a fine - does not contradict the constitution on the basis of the government's tax jurisdiction.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2,700-page bill and ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, would otherwise risk forfeiting all federal health insurance funding, was not coercive and contrary to the constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed a lawsuit to block the law.
During the 2012 primaries, the bill was vigorously opposed by each of the major Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed candidate, Mitt Romney.
'Mugabe is a lame donkey' no longer faces jail time, court overturns bill
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they talk publicly about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and has been at the helm since late 1987.
Under section 33 of the Penal Code, a fine of $100 to one year could be imposed.
"State representatives should not be eager to blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
The government is likely to appeal the ruling, the BBC reported.
A number of injured Zimbabweans were vocally opposed to the law, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer at a bar.
In May, an opposition activist, often calling Mugabe a "squalid donkey" in public, ended up in prison.
In August, prosecutors charged a 26-year-old man over his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared it an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false," said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law criminalizing someone for making a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to express oneself freely," Malala said.
Despite having ruled Zimbabwe with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
She took small steps away from the dictatorship of a man in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the prime minister’s seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, only the currencies of other countries are paid in Zimbabwe.
The impoverished economy is being blamed on Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them had no experience in farming.
Central banks will keep swap lines permanently
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks said this in a joint statement.
“This is a very sensible move,” said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.
“So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not a surprise,” adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements gave access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could push the price of money even higher in the global market.
By default, a swap contract is used to overcome a liquidity shortage in one currency while simultaneously running a liquidity surplus in the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The European Union has agreed on banking supervision, and the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
Over a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish it because there was someone sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn’t want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn’t because I have a different OP number, address and that I just can’t finish it and that I should ask for the data to be deleted and make a new registration.
So I did, and on October 24, 2013 I wrote to technical support asking for all my personal data to be deleted from the database under the applicable Personal Data Protection Act.
The next day, tech support texted me to finish my registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of emails to technical support, where finally after the 4th urgence on 25.10., they wrote that personal data at my request was deleted.
So one would think that he could do the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal information, but in the end they also disabled this).
So I used a different username and it popped up on me that my personal data is already stored in order to complete the registration at the branch (how can they store something they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they replied that the personal data had actually been deleted on 25.10. and to send me an e-mail with the error.
I did this yesterday (about 3 p.m.) and they wrote back to me today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why I can not because I used the same name and date of birth.
I have been contacting technical support for over a week and have been working with them on this issue.
If it were true, no one with the same name or date of birth would be able to register.
By the way, in 13.22 I actually registered, to the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake e-mail and phone number and the world wonder, a page appeared that sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if you can’t register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties the registration to an email and phone number and data just didn’t disable it as they claim.
So again, I’ve told the tech support that they’re just lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they’re writing), because what they’re writing isn’t true.
I have documented several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "false" registration simply does not affect this.
To which Tipsport wrote a short sentence - I'm sorry, but since you're already registered, we can't verify your claim.
And he ended the communication.
Repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.
They can’t even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it didn’t actually take place.
So, to sum it up, Tipsport not only hasn't deleted the data as they claim, but they're lying when they say otherwise.
What’s worse is that it’s easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this issue on my personal blog, things got a little on the move, and from Technical Support, an email came saying that the matter is being submitted for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and notifying you of the same error).
Music playing in the subway on the Bridge
Prague Public Transport Company (DPP) has launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music is continuously played during the operation of the metro, is Můstek line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test run will take six months.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the program Between Us by singers Lenka Nová, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benek Orchestra.
After the opening intro and the acting story about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theater and the whole city lost electric current.
"Otherwise in Kolín they produced two kinds of cards, which I came into contact with a lot," he recalled.
He also mentioned President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who gave it to the astronomical clock, about ice hockey, but at that time he had no idea how we meet in those squares and we chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we're not going to play it here today," he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, is said to have sung from this album a lot suitable for him to sleep during the day, sing at night and accompanied him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, and all three singers were accompanied by a band consisting of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little song called Into the Hills of the Heart, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
"I'm glad that the song caught your attention, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, the song was performed by František Segrad, in the original by Richard Muller rewarded with a huge applause, and Hana Hegerová was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová with Horáček’s explanation of the communist ban and Baarová’s replacement by American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the composition Sebastián, and Segrado then sang a beautiful composition Prague set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zámucký and former Kolíňák.
But that was the conclusion, standing applause and an addition in the form of an optimistic composition We live in a wonderful time.
There was another addition to the playlist, but fans did not applaud it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four of them sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also older CDs, Michal Horáček their books and even the cover of the legendary LP, and took a picture with any interested parties.
Berdycha with Štěpánek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
The final of Davis Cup against Serbia was nominated by the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they are going to play on the field of their opponents in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to be on hot ground, it’s going to be wild and we need to focus as always on our performances.”
"We will go there with only one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Štěpánek, the creator of the victory point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya, and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of bewildered and grand-mouthed, acts unsupported by Obama’s Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media's claims that a "Syrian base" or "supplies for Hezbollah" have been bombed.
I wrote here recently that while U.S. aid to secular rebels in the country remains on a rhetorical level, Russia cheerfully continues to supply arms to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli air raid.
Clear message.
And notice, Israel has once again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular internet theories, it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government has awarded 2 members of the spacial units, probably Delta force.
It was not known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city is known to me to be a secret CIA commando consisting of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even the CIA's other location.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices protected by machine gun nests in Libya (on one such one, both SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of a U.S. commando unit in Tripoli, and as soon as they received word of the Benghazi attack, they volunteered to intervene and, along with five private contractors, shot their way into the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is baffled by the fact that during the attack, the commando was not officially deployed and was simply hesitant about what to do.
Commander of the commando unit will probably release these volunteers without orders.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not once, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently nothing like this was officially admitted, and even now there is only talk of a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US, even if half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
This would require much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost praised the Iranian Air Force for prosecuting US drones.
Little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the air, there’s nothing you can do about it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it happened that the Iranian aircraft F-4 Phantom chased the American drone in international space above the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew under Phantom to visually verify his weaponry without Phantom noticing him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared at his side and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without grumbling.
Not surprisingly, the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
She can't compare to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful lately, defender or midfielder Viktoria Plzeň František Rajtoral has a form that has earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, reveling in activity, after the intervention a penalty kick was ordered for him in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end they took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe that it will be a great game on Friday night," the Czech representative invites fans to the Doosan Arena grandstands.
The last matches did not go as well as she would have liked, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects.
That’s the way it is in football, sometimes you’re in good shape and sometimes you’re in worse shape.
I wouldn’t talk about the crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good," the defenders said.
Team Victoria will once again rely on the support of fans.
"It's Friday night and I would like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will reward them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Joanna: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a jump back a few years, into my memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - running in from school, throwing the bag in a corner and running out.
Play ball games with other children, jump a shot.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys embroider a festive tablecloth for Grandma's birthday with a chain stitch.
And then, after several warnings, wash the dishes, vacuum them, put the wood in the stove in winter and do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks write love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, whose content next to the strawberries did not even lie down) and drink it with the tea from dried herbs that my mom and I liked to collect so much.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was grave silence in my room when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on cassette tapes that were loudly rolling in the old tape recorder after my mother.
And then we would rewind the tapes on a pencil and play the same song over and over again, our favorite song, and toast it with a siphon.
Or we would make a phone call across the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and while we were on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, then ear was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it in such a way that we did not lack anything.
We didn’t need any iPhones, iPads, or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
Clothing was passed down from generation to generation and the best "adjunct" to the wardrobe was a batik T-shirt of domestic production with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics we were satisfied with the mentioned mom's tape recorder and at most Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which we used anyway only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Auntie Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said "just" go out.
When I was a little older we got a video player under the tree, my parents certainly saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed a strudel into him, said he was so good with the tapes, so she tried to make a strudel.
Unfortunately, he was sleeping, but it was his last bite.
Well, he still has this story, poor thing, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she stuffed a strudel into a video and thought she could play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can’t bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, communicate without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I had arranged with our neighbor’s granddaughter on our holidays, when we would meet again next summer at our grandmother’s - and so it was, so it was true.
We met.
Do you want to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter, when the whole village and I were running outside, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill near the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I used to hear that notorious phrase before every dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that still applies today, but you certainly don't have soap tied to the tap in a lemon net in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad “worked” in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay on the floor, leaned our feet against the tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackling of wood coming out of the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on social media, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we did not write messages every day through various chats, texts.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew much more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It's nice to remember, especially if I'm adding these memories by looking at albums where black and white photos are neatly glued with black corners.
And if I didn't know how old I was at the time, the back of the picture is always written the year of taking the picture.
I look at the fact that although the haircuts according to the pot did not suit us very much and moreover we had pants from our cousin two numbers bigger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
I’d rather take that step back to reality.
Until 2013 and I'll see what the modern age will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for a young adolescent generation at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they are missing out on a lot that they will not experience this "pre-monkey" time either.
I wish they did!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents from the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against cell phone makers including Google, a company it re-licensed during an auction in the wake of Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of infringing on seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps connect search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial bid for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by a group of Motorola patents.
"Despite the failure to bid for the patents at the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe on the patents," the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, according to it, the patent infringement by Google is being committed intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
Miloslava Cejpková: November smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first she put away her smile, the one she kept showing off as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
She was relieved because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was a grandmother and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adika around her.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless courses in business skills.
Now they're finally really fit.
So that she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade suit.
November, no other month can do that miracle to really smile, like the time they were on a trip with the one who hasn’t been here for almost three years.
Egypt Appoints First Freely Elected President
Mohamed Morsi has taken the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy approximately 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built overlooking the Nile that resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been under intense attack by governments for most of 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. in a small motorcade, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential pomp of the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the motorcade could pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
Morsi’s personal prestige, derided as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tire,” has grown sharply since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as an Islamist candidate but also to all those who want to lead the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak to the end.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi said, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give his inaugural address.
While standing at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
Military commander Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of “army and people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center for secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to retake the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council that took them from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath in court rather than before parliament, as is customary, he has submitted to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos, they are supposed to ease the tension
In the future, police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They would supervise the order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior counts on this.
He said it would help to improve the situation in the country by “prompting the provision of social housing”.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
Some 80,000 people lived there, mainly Romani people.
The adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Usury was rampant.
According to experts, the problem areas have since grown by a hundred.
Relationships between their residents and others are intensifying.
Anti-Romani marches were held in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the Interior Ministry, it is difficult for police in ghetto areas to maintain security and order.
The fundamental condition is "the consistent application of an equal approach in law enforcement".
But this cannot be achieved without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would run errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
"Thanks to the established trust, specialists will more easily be able to prevent a number of unlawful acts," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive allowances of between 500 and 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is scheduled to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements here," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will identify places where a special policeman would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project ends.
According to the project proposal, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
There should be 50 members per year in this training.
They will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers working in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior design, there would be three categories.
A minimum standard would be met by hostels with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Higher standards would have social housing comparable to regular housing.
Tenants would have to implement an integration plan that social workers would put together with them.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to school, retrain and actively look for work.
If they were to be included, they would move up to a higher standard of living.
According to the Interior Ministry, the transitional housing system should last at least 30 years until the next generation grows up “in a pro-integrationally motivated environment”.
The social housing model is being prepared by local development and labour ministries.
It is to be proposed by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Viewed from a greater distance, on top of Uhlířský vrch there is a conspicuous white plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the church was completed, an alley of four rows of linden trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The Way of the Cross on Uhlířské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
On the fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by local artist František Nedomlel.
He used different types of trees from the Low Jeseníky region.
Similarly, the pedestals from the rocks from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also shown at each stop.
The coal hill is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus Volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
In doing so, she ejected significant amounts of volcanic ash along with rock fragments from the bedrock, which gained a reddish-brown color by burning.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters thick.
The second eruption ejected red, brownish-red, and in some places black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
The tuffs contain volcanic eruptions of up to 1 metre in size, and the second eruption ended with a lava flow.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m thick layer of slag basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate the ejection of volcanic ash with lava discharges are the most common type of volcano.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, it was threatened by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under the pressure of experts and the public, the mining was able to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
However, the problem lies in the porosity and small cohesiveness of the rocks, which quickly weather, crumble and slide down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare plant and animal species.
The repair is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain the characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can get to Uhlířský vrch by following the green tourist trail from Bruntál or from Slezský Kočov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the linden alley, where the short nature trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small severance pay.
Ivana therefore quickly sought alternative housing for herself and her then already older mother.
She got a tip from friends for an apartment 3 + kk in an older block of flats on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and dam impressed me on the other side," Ivana remembers the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year probationary period.
"We have lived here for more than thirteen years and I would not change it because of gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
Mother and daughter moved from a 120-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and gave away almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arranging took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner knocked out the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hallway, and, conversely, a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
Architects used plasterboard to delineate the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed for the new placement of lights.
The first step she took after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improve the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana didn’t know what to do with the bathroom.
For years, I’ve been reading magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On the recommendation of the young architect Kamila Douderová.
“It was the most important step in the future,” Ivana said.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the available hallway.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and barrier-free.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is also a comfortable seat, near the toilet bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Douderová continued.
As part of the program How to Build a Dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also participated.
In the space created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without the help of the classic principles of optical division, for example, semi-transverses or Japanese walls.
"This would result in a violation of the openness and uniformity of the space," explains the architect.
The sleeping and living areas were originally separated.
It was enough to turn the two sofas to each other and build a custom-made duvet box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used a quality marmoleum, the sliding door revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
If necessary, the kitchen area is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor from anti-allergic marmoleum has a number of advantages over the previous one from laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how to work with space in a prefabricated building.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
Grafoglass paneling with a motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underscored the modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are conveniently controlled from a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older one works perfectly, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier as well as with high-quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The boxes had been placed on both sides before, and the owner felt a bit like she was in a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and rescheduled the deployment.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, white area softens slightly pearly surface.
The washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into a small space thanks to an imaginative solution.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
Unique graph glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, moreover, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers, which remind her of the popular neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and sink, in the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower room has Ronal glass doors.
The task was to create a clear simple space from the given environment, in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior in material and color, trying to give it an elegant, cozy, not too cluttered look.
"Another condition for the award was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of everyday items," adds Kamila Douderová.
The Supreme Court has ruled that timelessness can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for any crimes he may have committed prior to the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the other hand, he ruled that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their mandate in November last year, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Kn?tig said.
With this decision, the court rejected the motion of the prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies for giving up their mandates and not causing problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister, who offered them these posts, can still be prosecuted.
He was also arrested by an anti-corruption police officer.
Bart's lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV deputies, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but due to the protection of classified information, I cannot comment further."
According to the Law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
News server tn.cz reported that Bárta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to news server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment Bárt allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that the arrest of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, spokesperson for the Police Presidium, declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, said on Friday.
It is the local prosecutor who supervises Bárta’s case, and from her words it indirectly follows that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under the secrecy regime.
Reporter News managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta Kateřina Klasnová in front of their residence in Klárov, Prague.
She was just loading her suitcases into the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bart’s detention.
According to his words, he has no idea what is going on in the case.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate list, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.
Vít Bárta, who ran unsuccessfully for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement of Tomio Okamura during the previous early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Plzeň Region, is known for his corruption case of bribing MPs with Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a 30-month extension.
The sentence was later changed and Bárta was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
Pro Prospela has always been family first, which is why she wants to fully comply with it at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's done with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he reports with determination.
The New York Rangers, who failed to make it into the season, also have two injuries: Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you join the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
As long as I don't have anything on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that says they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere else has it been added that this actually happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but this is simply not the case.
You haven't heard from the club?
This kind of communication happens every day in the NHL.
That’s where the deal really comes in.
When a player is injured or someone is not able to do it and the manchaft does not tread.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get this contract.
But it's the same thing in New York, isn't it?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn’t make it into the season, so there’s a chance, don’t you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, this is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to work out after all?
I’ve had those expectations since July 5th, when the free agent market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
No, I'm going to Tampa to see my kids and my wife.
I look forward to seeing the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It’s because I’m a father and a husband, and that’s where it all comes in.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to be a dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
On Sunday Vasik has two hockey games, it is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
One day it will get to the point where all the goals, wins and passes won’t replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Whatever job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play in the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - apart from my family - belongs to sports success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that is what family life is all about.
My kids, I'm sorry, our kids - my wife and I - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
We would love to see them continue this trend.
Because in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should give them that chance.
Are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We will continue to practice as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic on Hluboká and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or wherever our footsteps take us.
It's perfect to stay warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it took a lot of strength and self-denial, and it took a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who yearn for this so they can choose what they do and how they live.
At your age, how long will you have the will to work hard, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have me in the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it'll stay there.
It's impossible to plan.
So you can say that you will wait this season, how will it turn out and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going day in and day out.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant has been postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and agreeing to Contracts of Difference by the government.
With these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give a recommendation to the shareholder, not hide behind it.
Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to reconcile that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to have one.
The president admitted this in an interview with Law, which will be published tomorrow.
Sales and marketing of ŠkoFIN led by Abrahamek
His competencies include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
In office, he replaced Luděk Šantora.
Abrahamek has linked the last 14 years of his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last job was at Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for more than five years.
ŠkoFIN was established in 1992.
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
Shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, reportedly Terminal Three.
Reuters, citing the California media, claims that the lawmen shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said there was a shootout in which two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration were injured.
How many people were injured and whether there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about the event with more injured.
CNN: Israel has bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
This was reported by an unnamed US government official on CNN.
The Israeli press has widely reported the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government has not confirmed the attack.
When asked by CNN, an Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the incident.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli airstrike, according to a US government source, was rockets and related equipment that Israelis believe could be carried by the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The Associated Press quoted another U.S. security official as saying that the target of the Israeli strike on the Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen a battery of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track the missiles and their targets.
According to an Israeli TV report, the missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and the AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly said it would hit any arms shipments destined for Hezbollah or other terrorist groups.
Is the internet the end of travel?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current trends are maintained, this will represent a 12-to-17% increase from a record profit of US$290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year and the second half of the year began with a sharp increase, mainly in Australian and British off-business travel.
“As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual earnings before interest and taxes,” he said.
This includes Australia and Great Britain, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
The recreational business rebounded in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while corporate clients spent less.
U.S. trade recovered after a loss in the seasonally weaker half of the year and is expected to generate a year-round profit for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre's stock was 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September for protesting planned oil drilling in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported by AFP, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also said that her initial piracy charges had not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic have been transferred from a detention facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the detained activists’ relocation are not clear; according to the DPA, this was a planned move.
The environmentalists were initially charged with piracy and face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the charge with a milder brawl, which carries a lower sentence, with a maximum of seven years in prison.
Greenpeace said in a statement that piracy charges had not yet been dropped as promised.
That means the detainees are now being charged with two crimes.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace piracy charges with charges of disorderly conduct.
But when the 30 inmates stood before the committee this week, charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, new charges have been filed against everyone," Greenpeace said in a statement.
In mid-September, three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries were detained at the Gazprom oil platform.
The environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have filed an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of detention.
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
“They can actually be worse,” he said.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked Dutch King Willem-Alexander for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to speak about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Maliki has played a large role in the resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which he said was partly due to fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards will be required for English literature classes.
The exam will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language courses will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take the Maturita exam in a language and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an elective subject.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics - the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which supervises the school-leaving examination, reveals changes in the structure of the school-leaving examination, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech last summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our examination system to regain the trust of society" and that insistence was needed to make the graduation exam "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours of mathematics per year, and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to math, coalition sources have reported that a comprehensive math graduation exam - along with more emphasis on this subject in the rankings - is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the cancer in ČSSD
Before the elections, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostrava ČSSD erupted.
It all culminated when Ostrava Mayor Petr Kajnar appealed to the court for undemocratic selection of female candidates.
Still, the actors of the case did not want to comment too much on this, so as not to damage the party even more before the elections.
Now the votes of the voters have been counted.
On Monday evening, the leadership of the ČSSD Ostrava called on the mayor of Ostrava to step down from the party, and he will probably also push for the loss of his office.
Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
He described in an exclusive interview for the daily Deník what is at issue and who is on whose side.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The ČSSD certainly expected a much better result.
Has it been damaged by the fact that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that Social Democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, this is consistent with the state in which the CSSD is now.
It is the side that has its internal problems, it is internally sick, and people perceive that it is not all right.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of ČSSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through decline for some time now, and unfortunately, similar things are happening in social democracy.
It is that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends in the ODS, have moved to people in the ČSSD and have influence over them.
It has to do with the fact that the police go to the offices of the Ostrava City Hall and collect computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is not composed only of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The ČSSD is divided into two implacable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Hašeks and the Sobotkas.
This too has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
Hašek's wing gradually occupied positions so that after the election it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
In politics, sometimes you have to compromise.
But everyone has an internal boundary where compromises can no longer be made, and that is my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the Chamber of Deputies, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get on the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka’s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
Hasek's wing, however, put a stop to it.
Why are you on Bohuslav Sobotka's side and not Michal Hašek's?
In my opinion, Slávek Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the ČSSD programme and, to a certain extent, also about the visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I have not heard anything like this from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can simply begin to dismiss the party chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, Michal Hašek ended his political career with what he has now demonstrated in Prague.
How did you perceive that the leadership of Ostrava ČSSD did not approve of you on the candidate list.
Political parties are based on competition, which one of their members will be placed.
The competition should be based, for the most part, on the programmatic visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but a political party is an elevator to money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people come to the fore through unscrupulously breaking the rules, breaking the party's statutes.
They make mafias out of political parties and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
It is more important for me to draw attention to this problem than to consider whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the Statutes.
Is that why you filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region before the elections?
The current ČSSD district executive committee in Ostrava is consolidating its power by the fact that organizations that do not suit it are able to abolish, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throwing out inconvenient members of the party.
An example is also the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednařík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they preferred to cancel the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that while it is the last option to enforce the Party’s statutes through the courts, at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD ceased to function, it is the only option.
The leadership of the ČSSD in Ostrava, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is trying to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba Lumír Palyza has a crush on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to remove me.
They promise people positions, they get votes, and then they consolidate their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was staged so they could call me a person who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the city has purchased property that is strategically of great value to it.
How do you feel about your stay as mayor?
The district committee has already asked me and others on Monday to consider staying in the ČSSD.
But I think it’s like a thief shouting, “Catch the thief!”
When we look at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I do not see anyone in Ostrava’s Social Democracy initiating and enforcing, sometimes even against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I don’t read this except to prevent others from going to the places they want.
Are you going to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must work well.
It's hard to believe that either side will be able to effectively run the state if they can't even drive themselves.
So I don’t think I’m going to leave the ČSSD right now, because I think it’s not me who is causing the cancer of this party, but these people who are trying to drive me away.
Olomouc opens a public skating rink in the historical centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas market and winter skating Pavel Spálený said that preparatory work on the ice rink started on 26 October and an ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick, and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took up 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stands with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably change," Spálený said.
The streets of Olomouc remind us of the approaching Christmas.
Last year the rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the repair of the Lower Square.
Repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched on the Upper Square one month before Christmas Eve.

The brutal murder of a senior in the Zlín region will again be dealt with by the regional court
The regional court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men rejected the blame.
They face between 15 and 20 years in prison or an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court overturned the regional decision and returned the case to him for consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons for this, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the youths assaulted a 77-year-old man in his home.
Senior died an agonizing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled, beat and kicked him all over the body and also threw about three dozen blows to his head with a metal object, apparently a gas gun.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain, or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The young men allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, the only, and only indirect, evidence against the defendants was scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the legal guidelines.
Although the scent marks from the crime scene and on other things were in more than ten cases identical to the defendants, the police initially treated them as factual and not scent marks.
There were also some mistakes in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven beyond doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the conditions were very difficult for the police.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The emergency medical service did not even call attention to the violent deaths.
After several days, the criminal was contacted by Olomouc doctors who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
Police were no longer able to work with all traces of the crime scene that relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
A young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six youths who were responsible for the robbery of a jewelry store.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopné.
The youngest of those charged with the murder of a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
He was released from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
Reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living Legend Wayne Shorter Closes Next Week's Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will finish next Wednesday with the 18th edition of the Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Lucerna Grand Hall together with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation by the PKF - Prague Philharmonia led by Martin Kumžák.
Shorter’s arrangements for the symphony orchestra include Pegasus from his new album Without A Net, as well as his earlier compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, which is also evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The artists he has worked with range from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the course for a new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past 13 years, he has been performing with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
After the festival, there will also be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska will present the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damkova has said that UEFA prohibits the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the arbitration committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing sentences for judges.
It is prohibited by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, there would be a threat of punishment.
Damkova also refused to side with Pilsen footballers in her position.
These speculations are pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, including from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to criticism, which erupted after Pilsen had recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damková assures that the judges are paying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the committee finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will limit the delegation, whatever the match was," Damkova said.
The reason for not publishing the sentences is a ban from the European Football Union, according to Damko.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes the violation."
"We're very suspicious and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop, there will be severe sanctions," she said.
Other countries respect the ban.
“We were really the exception,” she added.
If the release of the information continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of referees," Damková added.
Bárta’s detention related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak?
The President of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, head of the Department of Analytics and Information Technology of the Anti-Corruption Police, was arrested along with him.
The arrest is related to the wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
News server Novinky.cz has confirmed the information about the interception to the Czech Press Agency from a credible source.
The intercepted telephone calls by Janoušek and Béma, published last March by Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other as "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík", show Janoušek's influence on the city's actions under Béma's leadership.
The newspaper reported that they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which they escaped to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was owned by Bart.
News server Novinky.cz reported that Petržílek, the arrested criminalist, worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything at all or say anything at all," prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague said.
He also refused to confirm that he was supervising the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code.
Six out of ten companies are in intensive preparation for the forthcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only 8 percent of respondents said they had not addressed issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is the result of a survey conducted by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which polled 108 Czech companies.
As the two key codes come into effect, many managers are only now beginning to realize at the last minute how they can have a significant impact on their company’s business.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of political lashings, the business sector has long been uncertain about whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"However, they now have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law without complications for their companies," said Jan Spáčil, partner of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies heavily engaged in the new laws, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 percent of the companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodification, but still has a concrete idea of how to prepare for it.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet addressed issues related to recodification.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code for the largest number of surveyed companies is the conclusion of new contracts (21%), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16%), as well as changes in the land register and liability for damages (ten percent each).
In the case of contracts, one of the most significant innovations of the whole recodification will take place, namely the unification of the contract regulation only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Codes will cease to exist, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of relationship arrangement," said Lukáš Poddán, attorney at law at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In connection with the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the most important topic to be the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and running of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is threatened with bankruptcy or gets into bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if members of boards of directors and company executives do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefits gained for the performance of the office in the last two years," Spáčil added.
Pierre Rainero: I’m trying to make Cartier’s style evolve like a living language
My job is to preserve tradition while leading our brand to modern things so it doesn’t remain a dusty relic, Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, explains in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year Award.
You can vote for him or any of the top 10 nominees in the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year competition.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle has watched his father fall unconscious over and over again and has gone to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital Yaounde in 1981.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to his brain, where he developed a hematoma that caused problems throughout his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonians could visit the doctor, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
They cannot enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his compatriots suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon himself at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram themselves into vans, attach themselves to the roofs of medical supplies, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
It is not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as true heroes: feasting, singing, and dancing, and the best accommodations the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate, and Bwelle - with her broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willing to get involved in the local merriment.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each expedition,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or gifted glasses or a birth certificate for free - a document that the school requires, but which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, city hall, or home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to a recovery site to make room for another patient.
Using light from the generator, the operating room, and hygiene equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, performed 700 operations for free last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said he'd be able to work again after hernia surgery.
“It will change our family’s future,” the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second work funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
“We washed Dr. Bwelle’s hands thoroughly, removing blood stains or holding his tools,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never experience that.
Students volunteers usually pay their own way to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation, and study.
“He’s definitely a hero,” says O’Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
It's not a burden to Bwelle.
Helping others to live happier lives, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Make people laugh, ease their pain - that's why I do it.
Take a look at the ASCOVIME website and find out how you can help.
Minister Holcát reinstates Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention from the Ministry.
In the pursuit of this profession requires not only high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will be happy and with all responsibility to push for those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilful nurses in our healthcare system, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, through their approach to patients, do not help us to carry out their vocation with all empathy and help us to improve the image of nurses in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nursing position and intends to cooperate, among other things, with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I fundamentally do not want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but instead I see them standing side by side, each with their own competencies and together with other healthcare professionals, forming a well-coordinated working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the exercise of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the nurses unnecessarily burden and waste their time, which they could and should rather devote to patients," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with the team and with the management of health service providers, adjusting competencies, as well as labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading the nurses with an insufficient number of them at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, which, however, are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the function of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of anonymity for such a complaint and let the competent authorities investigate the specific case," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary School of Nursing in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been the head of the department of nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse at the bedside in the internal department, and also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she was the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, and has devoted herself to lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
I don't want to get caught up in hate
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a small volume is indicated by the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houšt'a (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahuda was interviewed by another significant Czech writer of the present time - Emil Hakl.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - so I wouldn't get choked up with hate.
To see new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, young organisms afflicted by blind selfish efforts.
I’m not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, skank souls and polarized ideologues trying to sell their “product” with the expression of a little sellable whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my judicious friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I can feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I prefer to go for a walk and then read books by the lamp in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of frustration, of hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, in about ten years.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, after that, I lived.
But there's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see more lone exercisers, everyone in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I am participating in the vast, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an elusive future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game where a trial and error creates a new generation of beings who, in trillions of interactions per second, create some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a continuous process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, conducted by the right and left halves of the brain sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Just as periods of peace are interwoven with the silent metastases of wars that may one day awaken, so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, one day I would be quietly overwhelmed.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and posed to layers that are stored in the darkness "below the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cerebral cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient rings of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks snakes, seeks answers in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing presence, in an unceasing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload failures.
Analogously - as if you "fell" a PC, from the program of speech emulator and translator from foreign languages you would get tangled up first in the operating environment, for example Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up with a dark green flashing screen Bios, in the basic system that controls functions and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you interested in this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior to date, a rift appears.
Nietzsche said, “He looked so long into the abyss that the abyss looked into him.”
Pure feeling - that a person is lost if all hope disappears, psychologically "die" and a new quality begins.
Why do I care about it personally?
I will answer with a parable.
Once upon a time, a man fell into a pool and drowned, and days and months and years went by, and he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - to live.
He became a "diving man".
Perhaps some sentence written by me will help, as Hrabal’s texts helped me once.
To what extent do you think about the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another superego, but I think it was best described by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo’s submarine, and ran along the Shades in dark alleys.
After all, behind all the branching of the authors and their message is: "The sun of bright worlds of other Karel Hynek Mácha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
In retrospect, through the people who read the book to you?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, they will casually contact me on the street and thank me for helping them make some difficult life decision with my book.
Books are actually "lives" or better said, "worlds."
They are encoded in letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of the language.
We can bring them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow to the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden to the divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to ancient demonological books we commit witchcraft.
Once the book has been published, a chain of author readings awaits you.
I remember you used to love to read.
Will you be happy again, or do you feel differently after years?
I prefer to just talk today.
And what did I find out?
There are intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are unobtrusive, do not draw much attention to themselves, have a friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
Let me give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec there was (and I hope is still alive) one curly bookseller (it is aptly called Červenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
During one drink he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houština.
I stared into their eyes, and then I was shown a shredded, read-out copy of my book.
In embarrassment I put aside my just-read casket and wept briefly in a manly way.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and weeping drunkenly.
Then the young blonde half-breed couldn't stand it, and with a roar he jumped out of the window into the snow.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night country and seized by the happy fury of the sensitive, the aching soul of the countrymen, and the caress of the obscure patriots - howling and sobbing like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is different in form and content from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of a folk healer the words of an old Russian fable: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, a grey box on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were devils in hell a long time ago, drawing lots - what role on this earth we will play.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it on the free tide of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful form of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, affects our volition from such depth and breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we act with absolute certainty precisely in the intention of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various malfunctions, stands on the coast of the ocean unconscious and in a leaky sail made of dirty handkerchief catches the tides of the wind.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama yesterday backed away from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Citing hundreds of thousands of notices of termination from providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama broke his promise.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called a “media hype,” Obama urged Americans who received the announcements to seek out new insurance policies in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even cheaper than expected.
“You’ll get a better offer,” he said.
His administration says it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who bought insurance for themselves may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
“I say this to these Americans frankly: you deserve better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market had been “poor” since October.
“I’m just as angry and disappointed as everyone else,” she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Irritated, Sebelius uttered the phrase, which was picked up by a microphone, yesterday to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday’s committee meeting held after a heated exchange with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she, too, must join Obama’s care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act "architect" had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance and purchased a program through HealthCare.gov, which he now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be talking to next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and, according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, are already hand in hand.
The transaction is expected to be announced in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG Group.
Sazka Telecommunications has launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
To everyone’s surprise, there was no mention of the company’s desire to penetrate telecommunications.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunication lube Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing director of Radiomobil (now T-Mobile), then became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and for the last time headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She entered the auction and now she admits that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like this under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will share their networks completely.
Vodafone needs a partner.
That could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in tendering for LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or a newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the saved money on a fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately get a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it’s a big moloc that’s waiting to be restructured.
At auction, Kellner would have acquired LTE networks in O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will share the network.
The auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
From next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between a call with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that gathers evidence of favoritism of the castle party.
In the past, no one has documented the influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík, let alone signed it.
True, the editors took the lead.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where some journalists’ attachment to Zemanov comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathic friendliness.
And if we assume general rottenness, we cannot forgive the question of whether other equally unscrupulous interests of power, which have not yet been given the opportunity, are striving to change the situation on television.
Those who say that there are no apparent attempts by politicians to intervene in broadcasting in developed countries are right.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The plaintiffs do not dispute their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be their own tendency, the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have not yet reached this stage of civilization, and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps even in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of the confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings collides.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this Country: Presidents on the Brink of Power
It is almost a rule that at key moments of the country the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
Had T. Masaryk been five years younger physically and mentally, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term, and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably would not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly beyond the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight hard for its legitimacy there.
And most importantly, the surrender would not leave the nation hungover to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and he was still in shape under Munich, but during the war he started to go downhill and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their coups.
It's a shame to talk about Hácha.
He was elected on the grounds that “the president will not be in a position to make decisions.”
But he had to, even if the big decision was not with a knife on Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, Chief of Intelligence František Moravec said what should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, would not happen to the Germans so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, they did not believe him, they were afraid.
The human wreck Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow had told him.
Ludvík Svoboda finally made himself impossible by participating in normalization and had to depose him, already completely senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sickly depressed old man made things easier in November 89, but that is the only plus.
Havel was lucky not to meet him in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, but many of his achievements give a sense that thought processes are not what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like what he looks like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the country.
Or maybe it's a threat, just not visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not good (from a historical point of view) that the president is not completely in power.
But this is not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect someone in this country who's reasonably well-intentioned and reasonably sound again?
Distant planets, black-and-white films, and a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would casually pitch.
In the concept of his quartet, which will conclude this year’s Strings of Autumn festival on November 6 in the large hall of Lucerna in Prague, everything is connected with everything.
The score of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, winner of nine Grammys, former bandmate Miles Davis and today probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He doesn’t talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I came to the conclusion that it is best to let life surprise you.
“Too many people plan everything and then get disappointed when things turn out differently,” Shorter says.
How Insects from Thailand Raised Paris Bar Sales
You may sneer at an insect without knowing that you eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you have a unique experience also taken care of.
Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of Le Festin Nu, was the first to put the insect menu on the menu of his restaurant in Paris in early October.
Inspired by William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, the bar is located in the trendy 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can now eat not only various larvae, locusts or water beetles, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (to prevent insects from damaging their wings, distorting their legs, or damaging their eyes) are sent all the way from Thailand to Daviron.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, elsewhere it is common.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneering menu lists several reasons to eat insects.
The first is the environmental benefits, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes a pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just providing a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of eating a pest-decorated beetle, but the reactions of customers of the Paris bar to the insects served are very positive, according to the owner.
It is said that even skeptics will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and finally choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: A new green for savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the state’s lack of interest in addressing the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who save significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measures, but also for the chance for construction companies and building material manufacturers.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
In terms of state fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, and it is also one of the most significant growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program so that further calls can be announced within its framework.

Dog Summarizes Carpet, President Tripped and Ended on Crutches
President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the chateau in Lány.
What kind of health condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that U.S. espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the U.S. defense stance on his surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage “has gone too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilot” in light of the NSA’s instigating revelations about spy activity, which emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry said via video link at an open government conference in London: “There is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government actually learned about some of the things that were happening out of inertia because there was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War and then of course 9/11.”
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has occurred.
I assure you, there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was pursuing good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to murdering and blowing up people and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are preparing to go to Europe to respond to foreign concerns over alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans that they need to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because they are disillusioned with the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is really important for the national security interests of the US that Europe stays in the same boat with us, in view of the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations on European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite their anger at the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, despite the agency's chief saying this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Further revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
James Clapper, director of national intelligence, defended spying on the Allies as necessary, saying it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip this year, and he hoped members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate will be published.
He said the program is still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help repair relationships, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as planned this weekend to respond to the animosity sparked by US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activity.
Australian woman appeals against Thai prison sentence
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in jail on Phuket Island after falsely claiming she was assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with perjury on June 15 by a Phuket Island provincial court when she told Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men allegedly holding her, had assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket Island police held talks with Bamford for two days before she confessed to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney-based Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Evidently it's a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that she was on holiday in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand in the meantime.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she received a warning that the appeal could lead to a lawsuit that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to fix a tarnished image for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
Jágr joked: A goal from a break?
He won the puck in the defensive zone and was never caught again.
In addition, the leak turned into a quick forehand loop.
Jaromír Jagr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svoboda was contacted by the director of Czech Railways and asked if I would be interested in doing an advertisement for their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!"
They say we're very similar in type.
I guess I'll just have to stop the night training so I don't speed up any further.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense could speak afterwards and he would like to make an advertisement for jets!" he added.
New Jersey won for the second time in a row.
"And most of all, you've noticed - Marie Rottrová's treatment is working," concluded Jagr.
Instead of post-election sirloin post-election goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a pile of losers.
It is not only the parties that did not even make it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the ČSSD because of their internal schism.
Politicians served us post-election goulash on the weekend instead of a holiday candle.
Andrej Babiš’s movement became the jumper in the election, promising voters to change the current political style of government.
The fragmentation of the electoral result and the split in the winning party is playing into the political (from) the will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to the unpleasant event, he still has several ways to win it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD’s chances of winning the Prime Minister’s seat are moving away in my eyes, entrepreneurs are getting closer to Andrej Babiš.
Although post-election development is far from an early and smooth creation of a stable government, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus for the economy compared to the election scenario of the left-wing Communist-backed ČSSD government.
Due to the loud opposition of ANO to get together with ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (total 111 deputies).
Due to the split in the ČSSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of coalition negotiations can be quite daunting for the ČSSD.
The minority government of the ČSSD composed of "non-Zemans" at the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the ČSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to fall back on other early elections?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the ANO’s electoral mandate.
The ČSSD’s plans to introduce sectoral taxes, increase income taxes or build a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
On the other hand, the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit parties agree, for example, on business support, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support for employment of disadvantaged people, reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Frictional areas are most present in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
However, ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition to date, ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL, would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better outcome than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
