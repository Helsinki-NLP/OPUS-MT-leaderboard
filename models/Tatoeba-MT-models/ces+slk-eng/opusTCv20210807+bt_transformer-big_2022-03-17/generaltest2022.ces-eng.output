The great return of the Czech underdog is coming.
Paul French has been called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goaltender Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The 31-year-old will be on the bench and could soon reach the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litvínov, Plzeň and Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He was in the middle of the game with Vegas and has not been seen at the NHL rinks since.
The incident occurred at a time when an experienced goalkeeper was moving from one pole to another.
“Pavel French will be out for about three to four weeks with an injury at the bottom of his body,” the Denver-based team said in early October.
His return to the NHL was extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning U.S. time he was called up from the farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
He scored 94.5% in the AHL.
The Pilsen hockey player wants to finally assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his senior year he had problems with hips and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL, "Francis" had 36 games, his success rate is 92.3%.
Charles puts a veil on Camille's Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas card this year.
Prince Charles used a photograph of his wife, Camille, wearing a mask.
This was reported by the BBC on its website.
Wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long khaki dress and Princess Charlotte is wearing it.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, is wearing shorts and a shirt with a collar, just like Princes George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate did not mention, it is not even clear when exactly it was made.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas card on a pile of straw in front of a pile of wood at their country estate in Norfolk.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas card, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at a racetrack in Ascot.
Charles, wearing a top hat and a face mask, helps Camille put on her color-matched gown.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berbra a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague - Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr should have been promised a million crowns from the Prague Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
News server efotbal.cz reported that he had accessed part of the police files.
The chairman of the Vršovice club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red-and-whites did not commit any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly represented by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berber and former sports director of the then second-league Vyšehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
Criminals reportedly worked with information that Slavia had promised Berbro a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 Team SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should receive a million-dollar bribe from the SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with Slavia Tvrdik, the chairman of the board.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The president has denied any corruption.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opponent alternative to its development.
We have never engaged in unlawful conduct, have not sought to influence referees in violation of the fair play rules, and have not provided any financial compensation to anyone in this respect," Tvrdík told Seznam Zprávy.
Among other things, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former Slavia dark-skinned players and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The case of the alleged influence of matches through referees was triggered by police intervention in several places in the middle of October last year, including the FAČR headquarters in Prague.
The highest ranked in the affair is Berbr, who no longer features in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, just like the former sports director of Vyšehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks, and bvp are cold war larping.
Guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillery must come from the armored cabin and carry bullets by hand without covering).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, moreover, managed to get rid of Praga V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the lease, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and exported abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story.
I've got a manhunt right next to town.
Nutria came up from the river and did damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat down quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before anything came out, but of course a fox came along.
I let her come within 40 yards of me before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his headlamp in all directions, so I called out to him that it was a fox.
He was gone by the time I got down.
I mean, even a meadow can be a pruser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a series of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, you put your stuff to your feet in a sleeping bag, and you should be fine.
Israel versus Hamas.
Homeland found respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus, has spent billions of crowns on their acquisition in recent weeks.
The server iRozhlas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that within a day the amounts for the respirator varied by hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have behaved economically?
Why did others buy more?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubištová.
I respect soldiers and the army (I probably am not affected by the memories of the Czechoslovak Army that older generations experienced), but the Czech Republic is not able to benefit from the mandatory war.
We do not even have large warehouses of equipment that could be taken up by the trained, we do not actually have modern equipment even for existing professionals, moreover, modern technology is becoming more and more complicated, so the capabilities of reservists will be rapidly lost over time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to train anyone again.
Finally, reservists/territorial defenses are of great importance to countries like Ukraine, where they go to lead a mass guerilla and it is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not even have the appropriate geography for it.
We do not have individual skills.
That's not even the worst of it.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
It's a situation where you look like a guy who didn't hit an empty gate 2 minutes ago, runs into an attack alone between 2 or even 3 Swiss and says, "You know, what do you think's going to happen now?"
Well, of course they'll pick him as the average taxpayer.
The situation with this "fight the defender" skill is so terrible that I found myself genuinely surprised when I saw that our attacker managed to win one of the opponent's players.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting any major reversals in the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the strain in hospitals will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the variant of the omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous illness helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral drug molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of a severe course of the disease and its associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
It will soon be supplemented with paxlovid from Pfizer, which reports a success rate of up to 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how ready the local administration is for incoming drugs.
As mentioned earlier, the first to reach domestic patients is Merck’s molnupiravir.
The company was also the first to roll out the drug long before the current pandemic began, with the goal of finding a suitable treatment for equine viral disease in South America.
This research often ignores the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
Eastern Europeans, and we Czechs in particular, are used to saying "how our beak grew".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the UK, most people will say no.
In the West, they will tell you how they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist assholes.
And then they go and vote for parties like the AfD.
They're afraid of cancel culture, saying that in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the polls, west good, east bad.
But they're gonna find out what people really think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmour are both over 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three Czechs and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all objects are the same.
One is the Atom Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that sssr did not want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory either because of the safety or the speed of deploying warheads due to the western position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple), only the warheads were kept, not the entire rocket, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit came to pick up this warhead and mounted it on some carrier device.
Besides the museum maple, the others are in a derelict state.
In the second grade of elementary school we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was quite cool, he made good jokes, he was often too expressive, but he was kind of our mascot.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed a little, he went regularly, he did sports with us, he did not steal snacks or phones, he went purely dressed.
He also went to nature schools, did various monkey shops, but he was fine, perhaps never a problem.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same year, another class.
Shortly thereafter, a teacher was beaten, police were often there, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they didn’t try to make me pay, communication was calm.
I even sold a car like that, a guy called in a month and said he'd already signed over.
I say to myself that I am not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or other, as long as they behave as they belong in decent society (work, work, women don’t beat, just ordinary behavior).
But when someone comes in, they stretch out their hand, they pop out apartments and houses, they're just messy, they make trouble... no matter what color they are, but I'll be okay with it.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start a business, work, learn the language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will respect theirs.
A young woman died in a car crash in Prachatice
"The young woman suffered severe multiple injuries and despite the resuscitation care she unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot," Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokesperson for South Bohemian medical rescue workers, told Právo.
The accident was probably caused by a driver who was carrying the girl.
The 18-year-old Peugeot driver was probably driving in the direction from the village of Žíchov to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, went into a turn in the opposite direction.
After the collision with the Škoda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman Štěpánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of the Peugot suffered very serious injuries in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and remained wedged in the car.
After his release, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and in stable condition was airlifted to a hospital in České Budějovice, according to Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide information about them
Lukas Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars higher, where it is still worth to import, especially from Japan, where the mail is often free.”
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has become slightly more expensive, new VAT has to be added and the post office has to hand over the data to the customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail saying that customs officers are expecting the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the trader did not include VAT already at the time of sale, the customs office will determine it from the total amount for the shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not provide himself/herself with a customs procedure, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two checkboxes, insert two attachments and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
However, not all shipments are delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of accepted consignments from abroad fell from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to calls to supply the data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels in international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the data they needed and filled them in on time, we would be about half way there, according to Czech Post spokesman Matyáš Vitík.
Addressing inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, a reduction in VAT on food and fuel in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think is going to happen, what's inevitable with where it's going?
Prices are rising faster than salaries, I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you receive (who is the employee)?
I’ve been added 2% this year in gross, which is a mockery, but luckily I have a similar income from the business that I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are only sent to prison for six months?
This doesn't take my mind off how a court can only put an animal behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
Six months is nothing compared to his/her victim being traumatized for several years, negatively impacting her sexual relationships and relationships overall.
Not to mention, the rape victim may never recover.
Doesn't that deter potential future reports of victim rape?
The man from the grave "burned" his girlfriend from Kostomlaty
A man from the Grave inadvertently helped officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlaty, who had been issued an arrest warrant.
He called them to him himself.
But he took a detour.
First, he approached a passerby and made up a story that he had been robbed.
After calling the emergency line, the officers arrived at the scene and were not surprised when the alleged “robber” told them that he had made everything up so the officers could arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise officers on how to file a report with the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers then discovered that the woman was on a wanted list, in a nationwide search, and an arrest warrant was issued for her.
That is why the case is being dealt with by the CPC.
A sincere question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we are not ethnically or culturally anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise I agree with the meme of course, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there are an estimated 10,000 different religions in the world, if I'm not mistaken.
Which god or gods should one choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another.
But the Ten Commandments state that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Would it not be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong god out of the thousands of gods, and the one true god I just missed will send me to hell or some other place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months on one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All the C.S.A.'s would be fine with something like this.
It could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: We are constantly talking about cooperation between the education sector and industry, companies are hunting in schools and there is a kind of overlap, when the labor force is migrating from educational institutions to employment relations.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
The same thing should happen between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that no Russian, German or even Mongolian invader will ever invade here again.
I find it funny how you think of NATO as something carved in stone, we have allies and they will defend us if we get into trouble.
Oh, my God.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to slash their budget and all of NATO goes to shit.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already shown themselves once that they just need to show their back and take what they want.
The only thing that has long served as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that knows how to use military equipment of their time.
And nowadays, every teenager can fly remotely controlled devices, so what can not.
We don't need border fortifications, that sucks today, but a pretentious teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a boxed tsunami
You open presents under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home flooded with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why we have created a map of shops that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a shame to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved shop (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently in short supply on the market, as well as the money saved, as the packaging carton has become more expensive by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of environmentally-minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such shop is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and filling material are transported to Popůvky near Brno by individuals, which they accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular pick-up of discarded cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we create a more considerate world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopušníková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only the supply points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the home, where to hand over expired medicines, tires, retired electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, plus reusable things will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project already contains more than 100,000 such places.
“There is a gradual increase in collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help find uses for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors of the application from the Uklidíme Česko association.
I think it’s rather a shame that today’s technology is so simple and foolproof that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they don’t learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of folders on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple applications for photos or actually mobile phones generally just hide the underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the application.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but above all, let them learn something.
Rewrite the history, really.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency ahead of the weekend - starting in January - and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for over an hour, during which he unveiled the Presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans - at work, on the street - and mentioned so many events that they can not be done in six months.
But French politicians like it, and voters like it.
Macron’s supporters of the straddle between the right and the left agree on very little, but they do in Europe.
And in France, there will be new elections for the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities themselves.
Among other things, the French leader mentioned that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
Many commentators immediately came to the criticism that Macron was pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French President, Éric Zemmour, is touring France right now with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history book seriously and not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story of us versus them, and never as a story of the whole.
The Spanish, the French, the Czechs are learning who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo Vadis, Aida?

Trains start running according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday trains start running on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between Ústí nad Labem and Kolín, where RegioJet starts operating instead of ČD.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or slightly their route.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
Carriers began selling tickets in the autumn.
České dráhy plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day in the new timetable, of which 478 will be long-distance trains per day on average.
The trains cover approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic connections under the new timetable, trains will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Along with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be dispatched by the carrier to North Moravia or West Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fares by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Railways take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to the line R23 Ústí nad Labem - Mělník - Nymburk - Kolín.
The carrier will replace České dráhy after its success in the Ministry of Transport competition.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes concern long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlíčkův Brod, Zďár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has preserved its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Kraków.
According to spokesman Emil Sedlařík, despite the planned lockout work, the carrier also tried to maintain the most similar travel times of its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged in some regional lines.
Passengers are waiting for changes, for example, in the Českolipsko region, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Länderbahn will run on the line from Mladá Boleslav via Česká Lípa to Rumburk instead of České dráhy.
Passengers will also be able to benefit from a single rail fare for the second year.
As with České dráhy, their price will increase by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning from the other side?
We hear everywhere how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed and had to toil, die.
I have never in my life heard teaching from the slave side or from that time, nobody defends this, just condemns it.
No one tells you in school that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one will teach you in school that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, but they will tell you everywhere how brutally we, the Europeans, murdered them, while killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the USA, directly in schools, both in the northern schools and in the southern ones.
I have not encountered anyone intentionally concealing the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan the atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
Rather, my point was that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding it.
History doesn't care about anyone's feelings, it's just what it is, and I think it's a fatal mistake to judge without looking at the things of that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do it again.
By the way, when it comes to the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and I found it absurd to reject them.
In addition, the North has not been much better, as a lot of people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and they hated a lot of things, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and manipulate, moreover, our view does not exist with them (on YT there was also a video from television, where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionnaires and 1968).
What struck me as ridiculous in American schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was appalling, those students were pretty radicalized, and those schools supported them many times.
And if I imagine that these people will one day be much older, it makes me a little sick that this could be the voice of the majority, because it is among the young and in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that, for example, feminism has long since achieved what it had, and it is no longer about the same, it has become radicalized.
Today, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT and it leads to radicalization on the other side, where it often leads to resistance even for quite reasonable things.
Moreover, the more radical someone is, the more he is heard.
At the end of the day, I didn’t see anyone condemning me for slavery or colonialism.
I had a bad experience with geography, but it was mutual :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do alone?
Moreover, I consider the concept of nationality to be superfluous in terms of some personal identity.
If there's one thing that connects me to people, it's their interests, their worldviews, and their shared experiences, not where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: We have two Greek Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some crap about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially, they are Protestants, but in fact, they were born of Catholic modernism and are effectively Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic, but they go to Hussite services because it's very similar theologically, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanická Street.
Otherwise, St. Michael’s Church on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans, and they even celebrate Mass in Latin every Sunday at 3:00 p.m., as they did before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
Břeclav - The flame lit in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him due to the coronavirus pandemic, they received it from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-Břeclav border crossing in the morning.
It was taken over at the border last year.
Bethlehem light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, I look forward to it very much.
It is an honour for me to be chosen, said Girl Scout Amálie Budíková to the journalists present.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly on the border bridge, now at the Reintal-Břeclav crossing in the parking lot.
Usually, however, scouts take the train to Vienna for him.
There is no change in the distribution of the flame in the Czech Republic.
With Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojtěch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of the light, who will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take over the light in the stations, who will then continue to spread the flame throughout the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
Also this year, the Scouts have to comply with the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going the same way as last year.
We recommend both courier teams and organizers of local events to wear masks, try to keep the spacing, there were as few of them as possible, do not sing colleagues, just behave in a way that is as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbková, spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread together with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
Scouts and Girl Scouts have been taking care of its spread in the Czech Republic for more than 30 years.
The event is supported by hundreds of volunteers, so the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for the flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don’t have an economic education, so I don’t know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don’t think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education will make good use of this money, but I do not understand why this money is being given to agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned, it produces a useless product and disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where there are a million xy-funded/co-funded messages in the corridors, and such a company is just artificially kept alive.
This isn't the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the hold-up of development when this company keeps up and takes away contracts/employees from companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise.
Totally agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I myself think that internet ads do not move with me, but then I still catch that they influenced me - it's just so fancy that you can not always resist it.
That is why I support radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) ads altogether...
It's all rubbish, in the words of the classics - I would ban those Internets.
I have a feeling that this virus has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
1. "I will not believe something that most people believe and it makes sense, I am not a sheep, but I would rather believe something that is less likely, it does not make much sense, but it is important that I have my own original opinion, which I will claim is a cover thinking"
2. "I won't believe everything the media says"
3. "I don't trust politicians"
Christmas movies hit TV this year with 200 premieres
Los Angeles - Cinemas, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the Christmas film trend, and this year they will premiere more than two hundred of them to their viewers.
This was reported by the film database provider IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience, so these films are being created more and more.
Four times more Christmas movies were made this year than in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database includes only those films that have the word Christmas in their title, so there will actually be many more holiday films.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is mainly associated with fairy tales, worldwide are also popular films such as Home Alone, Love Actually or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946.
The real boom of Christmas movies did not start until 2009, when the American cable television station Hallmark launched a special film series.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas, included four films and was a huge success.
This year, the station began tuning in on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas films.
Rival Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its schedule this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
“In this magical time of year, the story doesn’t really matter, the important thing is that there’s a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” Brandon Gray, author of I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies, said in a statement.
"It's a form of escapism for the audience and a way to feel a bit of peace for at least two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding, which, of course, successfully resolves and the two kiss.
It’s like this over and over again, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching one after another, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19, he will not interfere in the final race of F1.
Only 19 drivers will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on covid-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack a better position from the 20th place, which he went out in qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not intervene in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He tested positive for covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid and Mazepin’s teammate Mick Schumacher, the first Max Verstappen, will race against Lewis Hamilton in direct battle for the title.
Mazepin is relatively normal and shows no symptoms, according to Haas.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
It is now isolated and will follow the guidance of the relevant public health authorities, with safety as the ultimate priority for all parties involved," its representatives told formula1.com.
He will not send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
A potential substitute would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
Kimi Raikkonen had a covid-19 at the start of the season, Sergio Perez no. Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
You could get arrested for this, too.
And no one will care that the boss said.
From the point of view of the law, covid is on the list of contagious diseases.
That is, in the same group as HIV, plague, jaundice or typhoid.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store, and the creator put half a year's work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home, sweaters were never much worn,” admits Liban, who spent 3,000 hours over his work during the six months.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24-carat gold threads in France and 2,000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarovski.
He decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk will give the sweater a softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
"I'm broke, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible," Liban admits.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater sold five years ago cost 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 soldiers to help Poland.

They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has formally requested assistance from NATO countries in connection with months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which is inviting citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.

Mutation Omikron spreads in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene is looking into another case of a child from Adam's.
“We are currently reporting further suspicions of this variant in another child from Adam’s prep class.
There is no direct contact with previous cases from the Adamov elementary school," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the week.
"We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases - it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague," she said.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of the Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the cases from Brno and Adamov.
Three of them have mild symptoms, according to the director, four of them have no symptoms.
No one suspected Omicron had traveled abroad.
None of them traveled abroad, nor any of their families, nor did they have contact with anyone who was abroad.
There is no link with the water polo championship, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svrčinová previously said that an international water polo tournament, which was in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.
There were also players from South Africa, and one Belgian player fell ill when he returned.
California will cut arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to impose a ban on the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the nation's most populous state using a legal mechanism used by Texas in its controversial abortion law conducted after the embryo's heartbeat was detected.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement came in response to Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which kept the Texas abortion ban in place, albeit against a nearly 50-year-old case-law that established abortion rights across the U.S. until approximately 24 months of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the whole law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measures.
In this case, the enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public, making it impossible for Texas Republicans to challenge it in the usual court way.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained, and has largely supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” he said.
“If states can now block review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use that power to protect people’s lives,” Newsom continues.
He is said to have instructed his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the Minister of Justice on measures that would entitle public representatives to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is how homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers are marked and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim at least $10,000 in damages and court costs from anyone who manufactures, distributes, or sells assault rifles, “ghost weapon” parts, or sets for their production in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private prosecution, then that’s exactly what we should do,” he said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state actually reinstated the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of the liberal Supreme Court member Sonia Sotomayor, who warned against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against selected officials in the southern state.
Every emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where the vaccine schedule is gradually being worked out and the vaccines themselves are being improved based on the results.
For example, there is already a large-scale study of the effects of 4 doses in Israel.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it’s too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine, based on an inactivated virus, should come on the market soon, which, according to the manufacturer's specifications, promises up to 10 times more effectiveness.

Poland threatens to cut payments to EU budget
According to Ziobro, the European Commission would act against the law if it used the new powers to stop paying money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed approval of Poland's plan to draw on the EU's 36 billion euro fund to rebuild economies affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to withdraw EU subsidies to countries violating the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this extortion by the EU with a veto on all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, head of the small Solidarity Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices,” Ziobro said.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justifiable, given that the EU is unlawfully denying us funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing.
His party takes a more radical stance in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Poland’s justice system underwent during Ziobro’s tenure threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobro, Brussels is building “impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but the change of government in Poland.”
“Warsaw faces a political dictation carried out by blackmailing and trying to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not a government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never accept such concessions to Brussels, as a result of which Poland's sovereignty would be limited.
“We will never agree to a colony status for Poland,” he said.
But to know... they have one kind of cheese in four different places in Lidl.
I didn’t look at other things, I met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, that's right, in that narrow sector there were all the selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is an avoidance, I will not smell any more in any market, actions of non-action, gold shop in the square, they may not have such a choice, but mostly they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.
To Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
I've been watching for two years as data is treated like manure here, most vaccine opponents are just a little more off the grid than most vaccine advocates.
Rational discussions are taking place on an expert level, but only extreme views are coming into the public space.
Always from wall to wall.
Binary reasoning: vaccines save us, vaccines are useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colorful cakes instead of robust analyzes.
Comparing apples to pears.
Here's the state, and here's the state.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in the two states.
Ugh, so I'm relieved.
Sorry for the outburst and have a nice day to all of you.
I was punished with a spoon when I was a kid.
It was never about grades, mostly just that I repeatedly refused to listen and misbehave (read instead of going to bed, fighting with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mom always threatened that if I did it again, I would get hit (sometimes even after another "catch" spoon just brought and put so that I could see her).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen that I received a few blows to the butt (over the clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishment (in reasonable execution and scale) is beneficial because the child reacts to them much more than to words.
I think the warning part is important, because it gives the child a choice, in its own way, whether to disobey and get, or to improve and punishment will not.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
System Defense
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, Vojtěch Cepl, answered a journalist’s question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him - whether the sacred document he swore to learn about at school or, on the contrary, an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once we agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojtěch Cepl then commented on the question.
Recently, however, there has been an increasing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojtěch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example, with the behavior of the directly elected president.
But one thing Cepl was right about.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The Institute must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
A constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of governance consisting of individual rules that set the limits of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be used against minorities or individuals, so we are tying bans to politicians.
At the same time, however, constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, at the University Hospital Brno they are fighting for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder on children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been struggling with recently.
"We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults," Petr Dominik, head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the University Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University, told News.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are child patients who are very ill with the coronavirus, which we have seen especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need moderate supportive care.
It takes place at the Children's Infectious Diseases Clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the ward continuously throughout the year.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires a stay in a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies of several months alongside adults.
In hospitals, there are also children in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“We have a child of several months and adolescents,” he said.
He is pleased, however, that no deaths from the coronavirus have been recorded at the FN Brno Children’s Hospital so far.
According to available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the children's hospital - not just the coronavirus department - is an integral part of the psychologist's cooperation.
At the same time, it also highlights the fact that, as in adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovid syndrome.
"That's why we recommend the administration of the vaccine to children," the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk on marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on mapy.cz.
In general, you can walk anywhere in the national parks outside the quiet zone (but do not climb over the fence into the park).
Skiing/cycling in the forest outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).
How does the conductor work?
The music is in my head, Josef Kurfiřt laughs.
He is raised by the Liberec Opera and originally played the French horn.
As a singer he can sing practically all repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the F. Šalda Theatre in Liberec, but also in Pilsen, in the Josef Kajetán Tyl Theatre.
He cooperates with the Hradec Philharmonic, with the Film Philharmonic or with the Podkrkonoš Symphony Orchestra.
China is building an impression of contained contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing a crisis better
Sinologist Jirouš: China is building the impression of a managed contagion and that an authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing fended off criticism for failing to stop a contagion that had turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero increase in the number of infected.
Countries, including the Czech Republic, compete for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors often help in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst affected Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing’s willingness?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says, “Hey, don’t you want an elephant?”
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because she eats grass, washes the trunk of the car, the children play with it.
It's just great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
Let's go, it'll be great...
After some time they meet and the one who bought complains: Dude, what did you sell for an elephant???
The lawn's cracked, the shit's huge, the car's dismounted, the kids are scared of it, and the wife wants a divorce.
The one who sold it says, "You talk bad about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."
World affairs are controlled by superpowers.
Although the equality of sovereign states is valid, it is the superpowers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a power if it works on its integration.
So far, it works at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
Personally, I think Europe is moving towards federalisation.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century the mood will be different and it will succeed.
I thought about it too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a wordsmith.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves two different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another comment "Spanish oranges and tangerines", when it is clear that they are both from Spain, while with "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
Moreover, I base this on the fact that the phrase “all American forces” includes their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further in American forces.
But again, maybe I'm just saying :D
Either way, it's a nonsensical request.
A five-degree earthquake has been recorded in Tokyo.

Vicki Holland of Britain tortured the monkey of Cosmosman Milly
Scary footage shows a frightened monkey cowering in a toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her down and laughed at her.
Holland also fed the monkey sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of its actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate’s Court has now banned her from keeping animals for life, reports The Sun.
Experts on the rehabilitation of the monkeys who took care of Milly after her abuse said they had never seen a cosman so terrified.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating workers at Monkey World in Dorset and is now happily playing with another rescued monkey named Moon again.
A four-time mother pleaded guilty to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with a suspended sentence of one year in the Gwent Magistrates' Court.
Holland was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, a lifetime ban on animal husbandry and a 12,000-crown legal fee.
Small Monkeys team leader who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: "Milly is fine, but rehabilitation will continue even further."
It took Milly a long time to get used to people again.
She cowered and hid from everyone she met, and any loud noise or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, having settled down and satisfied with the male, the sight of new people can still cause panic in her.
The psychological scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
The abuse of Milla came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrific footage on the woman's phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly cursing vulgarly.
In the next video, Holland offers the monkey cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, confessed to cocaine possession with the intention of selling it.
In her house, cocaine was found at a cost of 1,600 pounds hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was jailed for 30 months and Holland received a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from that prehistoric time three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
You mean you're gonna take the same things you did in sixth grade?
And the whole thing kills the idea of bifling, where no one, honor exceptions, cares if you know or understand.
Take the test for 1 and then no one will care.
Run and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the character of the roots of a quadratic equation and coefficients.
They've all been through this, and the absolute majority won't even cross it off and tell you they're totally fucked.
Then what the fuck are they studying for?
I am a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people do not want and do not need.
And in that moment, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is learning for the many people who will need the thing.
But, like, the remark that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I meant it, because you don't.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(And our communist past is probably involved in this, too, and incitement against the educated and the elites) But the price of barbarians standing next to these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, covid here probably never reached this size.
Wedding at a glance: Kadri and Andrey’s war continues!
Which is the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram to questions of curious fans, what disappointed her so much about Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
Between Kadri and Andrea, it's been screeching ever since the experiment started.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move in with her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
As you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! Kadri was furious in response to Andrea’s accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
Kadri's now-ex-wife's alleged honesty didn't appeal to his younger sister Linda either.
He decided to go public with his brother.
I don't normally comment on things like that, and we've never really said those things to each other in the family.
I don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone who is trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, it just won't let me!
I’m sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making a character of himself and helping our family when we needed it most, even though he was so young.
It makes me even more sad when I have to read such false information, which is probably taken out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to the words of Andrea.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
A drunk thief climbed up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cao began his robbery expedition in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
After that, he couldn’t think of anything better than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
That's where he stole two bananas.
A security camera footage of him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
He then arrested Cao.
The man admitted that he had drunk alcohol on the day in question.
And since he needed money, when drunk, he decided to rob.
The whole thing is under investigation.
The drunk climbed the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is limited in time and effective for pandemic emergencies.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law limits the scope of business.
That's not good enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not abolished.
More than 60 percent of voters came to Saturday’s elections in four municipalities.
On Saturday, people voted in the municipalities of Komňa, Lusatia, Nová Ves and Rovná.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have disintegrated.
A total of 99 candidates applied for 28 seats on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69, the youngest 33.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
In total, there were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies, said Eva Krumpová, Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office.
She recalled that due to the covid-19 epidemic, elections were more difficult on equipment and personnel.
In Komni na Uherskohradiště, the Association of Independent Candidates won Saturday's election, winning 27.76 percent of the vote and two seats in the seven-member council.
STAN received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two seats.
Citizens for Komňa also won two seats in the council, with 18.52% of voters voting for them.
The mayor of the village, Jana Křižková, who is a member of the Privateers, has also been elected to the council.
For one mandate in the council reached Komňaný - independent candidates.
75.48 % of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in the Pelhřimov region, the association Pro Rovnou won.
It received 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 came to the municipal council.
Voter turnout was 93.62 percent.
The repeated elections in Lusatia in the Most region were again won by the Lusatia and Svinčice Association led by Mayor Jindřich John.
It received 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four seats in the seven-member council.
The second place went to the candidate of the Municipality for the People, which voted for 43.27 percent of voters, so it will have three representatives in the council.
76.7 percent of voters came to the polls.
The elections in Nová Ves in Liberec region were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nová Ves before the ANO Movement.
59.88 percent of voters voted for the association of independent candidates and thus won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
ANO received 40.12 percent of the vote and strengthened against the regular elections in 2018, gaining a mandate more and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The election results will be discussed by the National Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign politician?
I think you know all these things that people write.
You're just playing dumb so you have someone to "guess" with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't really care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars she's caused, for example, the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An incredible fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, where the rescuers of the regional Emergency Medical Services intervened.
Workers at the Regional Operations Centre received an emergency call one hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews of ZZS went to the place immediately - medical and medical.
Upon arriving at the scene, paramedics discovered that the 27-year-old man was supposed to fall out of a window from a height of about 20 feet [12 m] and hit his head on the concrete!
They caught coal in Vítkovice.
But not the way it should, and firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after other measures within the pre-hospital emergency care, the ambulance transported him to another care center Ostrava traumatology, informed the spokesperson of the Health Care Centre of the MS Region, Lukáš Humpl.
I am more worried about the coronavirus than the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities
The spread of coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but the front line of the fight against the disease is mainly doctors and medical staff.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We ask the doctor David Rezac.

The legendary Nunes has fallen after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA had a great gala full of interesting results.
UFC 269 was a tournament.
Outsider Julianna Pen managed to defeat legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who had not found a slayer for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light weight, showed great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly swept Cody Garbrandt by technical KO in the first round.
He was also defeated by Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This brought about a women's bantam weight struggle between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pen.
The American woman entered the battle with each other as an imaginary "dwarf", as Nunes did not lose for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick, sending her to the ground.
Penová, however, did not allow herself to be forced to make any more mistakes and tried unsuccessfully to attack herself using a lever on her hand.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both opponents fought a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, she got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
He had to give up and attack.
She was a huge shocker to everyone when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier did better, but gradually the card began to turn.
In the latter he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
This did not go well for him, but then he put a lot of pressure on his opponent, got on his back and hit him with a series of wounds.
He won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but subsequently had to tap off.
The Brazilian defended the title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, Sean O'Malley scored a landslide victory, putting a hard right back on Raulian Paiva in the first round.
Subsequently, he beat him with a series of precisely aimed strikes and scored his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France then managed to cope with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter; now, after seven years, she has lost.
The hip, or the hip?
At first glance, this is not difficult.
Most nouns in Czech only express one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem to determine whether it is masculine, feminine or medium.
Then there is also a relatively large group of nouns, with which the genus is not established.
Such nouns fluctuate between two families.
When bowing, they acquire double endings and in some cases remain in an unabashed form.
For example, the words "strain" or "hip" are masculine and feminine, in the first they are bowed according to the pattern of the "machine", in the second according to the pattern of the "song".
For the next group of nouns, there are different shapes already in the first case of the singular, for example: "row / row", "kedluben / kohlrabi" or "potato / potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are literary, have the same meaning and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unscripted, similarly there are also other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "ditch" and "ditch", "dug" and "dug" etc.
Some words that penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were originally indescribable, but they are gradually adopting Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is masculine and feminine, or the word "buffet", which remained indisposed in the middle gender, but has endings in the masculine according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What does the situation look like on the Greek border?
Tensions are rising on the Greek-Turkish border because of the growing number of migrants trying to reach Europe.
Thousands of people have set out for the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped blocking them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.
What motivates refugees to go on an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like on the spot?
For three months, we didn’t see blue skies and choked, says Sydney journalist
Australia’s devastating wildfires have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and ravaged millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves deal with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent the drastic effects, as critics claim?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in relation to climate change?
Lenka Kabrhelová speaks with Sydney journalist Ika Detrichová.
False accusations have always been, and are, quite rare.
That’s why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is uncomfortable for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to book it.
I don’t know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped, and I've experienced how people are often treated by their surroundings or even by the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is for victims to finally open up about their traumas.
Too many people keep it to themselves.
There will also be those who falsely accuse others.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a large part of the charge is fabricated" and that it's a "trend" you only help sexual offenders.
The Czech Republic is flooded with unfinished houses, families do not have money to finish
Construction material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people are in a difficult situation because of this.
It does not have the funds to complete the unfinished family houses and the banks refuse to increase its mortgage loans.
In addition to material prices, the price of construction work is also increasing.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already built houses.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move into unfinished and unapproved homes.
In the worst case, the houses under construction are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rent,” says BHS economist Štěpán Křeček.
We build two or three houses in a year, and 50% of them happen to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult in that we have to keep some things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zdeněk Slivoň.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on building a house for five million, now it's gonna cost seven.
I think some will wait," added Slivon.
The most expensive material was copper, iron, plumbing and heating equipment.
Construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates of construction disciplines are missing and the influx of foreign workers is being held back by a pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
“Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Křeček said.
We're fine, and we're gonna be even better.
But the real vision is missing, says ČO commentator - myRozhlas
In addition to the traditional celebrations, the New Year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to Prime Minister and ANO Chairman Andrej Babiš and Christmas message of President Miloš Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What major things have we learned?
I have my own topic that I have chosen, I follow up on my bachelor’s, I always work on it for a whole year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
Stateswomen are completely calm with us, if a man is not a total macaque and something is left in his head, so the commission will not unnecessarily choke him on the theory.
For example, I had been studying for a week and when I was in the end, the committee always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which I immediately got and I got it right.
Otherwise, to those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project for them (we did it a lot, really beneficial, learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they have it all figured out.
I think it's great when there's an exam at the end of the course that reflects the knowledge gained in the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't overload your e-mails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be as much of a dick as they are.
Those people at the embassy might have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the Pooh bear statue.
You know, maybe put it so that it hits Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks at artists.
As soon as you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to an absolute minimum.
In addition, it still changes what function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
I've been getting a lot of shit lately, so I might have to go down to a tic-toe where a lot of the artists in my line of work are successful and they're not gonna let it happen.
In the end, I might even like to see something more user-friendly that doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy out of artists.
Statement of the Workers' Party in Donbass
To the Union - yes, to the break-up - no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years after the illegal break-up of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical catastrophe in human history occurred.
In the Bialowieza Forest on December 8, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav Shushkevich, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with the open lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the USSR as a subject of international law and as a geopolitical reality ceases to exist".
With one stroke of a pen, they “destroyed” a vast country of nearly 300 million people.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one sitting in the Bialowieza Forest destroyed what had been built over the previous seventy years had betrayed the socialist camp (created by the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialized, hampered agriculture, and separated fourteen republics from the world’s largest power, all of which had previously been economically combined into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all conflicts in the post-Soviet space, a series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the Arab Spring, the war in Syria - all this is the result of geopolitical surrender, the surrender first to the socialist camp, and then to the Soviet Union.
There is such a term in political science as "vacuum force".
Everything that has been betrayed and relinquished has been quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that have accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'm going to buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it into a dinner on Thursday.
In an alternate reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will reduce it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which the meat will become a burden on my digestive system by changing its price?
Or will I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the consumption date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday by CZK 120 more and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
The whole point is that if something is cheap, it must be bad, bad, or bad, it's retarded, to tell you the truth.
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the underpass the girls were handing out a brochure, I always take similar things to help the part-timers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of common sense and conservative views on the workings of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agitator.
After reading it, I found out who was publishing it and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was good stuff, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
It's a waste of paper, that's why the rainforests don't have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you comply with that person because you love him or her without realizing how [bleep] the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me a few times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or if I wanted to leave her apartment early, she would cry and beg me not to go.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
It was a great relationship for about a year, but then another six months went by and she started freaking out.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her I was breaking up and lied to her but that we could talk about it next week to calm her down and keep her from getting any amok.
Such a person will suck your feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are raging around buying a cloud of tests and rushing to get positive, they wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if they didn't have the test.
The only thing we are achieving is a complication for companies, carriers and others, due to the fact that their employees in the random number generator fell five days under house arrest.
In the West, they've stopped the clowning and recognized that there's no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and has yet to steal anything and drive his ego by inventing faggots.
I see we've got the good old bastard back.
After several years of downsizing and suppressing this unfair business, MLM Recruiting is back in the spotlight.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't have to care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but the trainings were more about how to scare and talk people.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to nibble a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, so one felt like a door-to-door seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned not to jump right on every tip and thoroughly examine the information.
At the same time, I wouldn’t lump them all into one bag.
People are successful in this business and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fat" account.
I haven't seen many of these things in the corporation I work in.
HR is calm, managers are minding their own management and they don’t give us much.
Regular evaluation happens somehow, in the form it takes in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what came out and what did not) - it's more like self-evaluation, than that someone would evaluate you by some numbers, and so on.
Corporate actions are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels that we are a kind of almost-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation.
But it works so they don't bother us as long as there are results.
A Czech woman missing in the UK is dead.
Her body was found in London.
For almost ten days, British police searched unsuccessfully for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, Jakub Kulhánek, the Minister of Foreign Affairs in resignation, announced on social networks that a woman from Uherské Hradiště had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our embassy in London that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is under investigation.
With regard to the family, we will not disclose any further information on the case.
My condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The last time a young woman was seen on a bus was on her way home from work on November 28, when she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her colleagues reported her missing five days later.
Police in London were searching for her, and Interpol listed her as a missing person worldwide.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man a few days ago.
What role he should have played in the case and what he suspects, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new members were appointed.
On Saturday, 11 December, new councils were elected in the municipalities of Komňa, Lusatia, Nová Ves and Rovná in the Pelhřimov region.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected councils have disintegrated.
99 valid candidates applied for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men received the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists have been registered for the new municipal elections in these four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men applied for 28 representative posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday's elections symbolically closes a rather difficult but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, a very monitored election to the Chamber of Deputies.
We had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last electoral district was processed on Sunday, December 12, at 03:49 p.m.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and, after approval, they will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To cope with the fact that we have a quite dangerous contagious disease took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without major setbacks.
Coping with how idiotically a large proportion of the population on all its layers, I have a problem with that so far.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because it will finally make me less dependent on other people not being assholes.
He would be stripped of his office as president and his capacity to regain it.
The chances of this happening are very small, as others have said.
Besides, I'm not even sure that file shredding would be considered treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: A growing number of people under 35 who are without sex all year round
More and more young adults in the U.S. are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious people, reports the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under the age of 35 giving up their sex lives rose from 8% to 21%.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who say they haven’t had sex in the last year are more likely than ever.
Other factors are contributing to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games that make sex less and less a priority for young people could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report not having had sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly,” said Lyman Stone, an IFS researcher.
Sexual activity is more common in married people, with only 5% of them reporting having had no sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
The fear of premarital intercourse and religion also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married couples under 35 continues to decline.
Young people are divided over premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that they are a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior is pushing this trend,” Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious.
Since 2008, single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month have had their abstinence rate increase from 20 to nearly 60%.
“Less believers” have gone from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decrease in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also found that people with low incomes or no job were less likely to have sex.
Another reason may be the proliferation of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby “replacing” this need.
This trend took hold mainly during the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole ordering of vaccination against covid is about whether society should force a part of the population to behave in a way that they do not want, but which can save their lives.
It is a rather difficult question, on which I am personally most interested in the question of social conscience.
The question, for example, is whether if we don’t order them to do so and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who didn’t really know much, we didn’t explain it well, he overheard some misinformation, and as a result, he didn’t get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we are responsible for the death of an obstinate opponent of vaccination, who is shouting something about bullying and the totalitarian state alongside the SPD and the Communist Party.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to fight drought?
This year’s winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of cross-country skiing Jizerska 50.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for fighting drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story, but it's not about the big guy.
One day in high school, a teacher led us across town to the boathouse so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we went down a fairly wide street, and who we don’t see in the middle - the followers of the Hare Krishna sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I got into a conversation.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had said.
“They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
“I told them I had no soul,” she said.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovic
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the meeting.
Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear that it will not accept a violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
The Chancellor said the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandy Group”, which brings together France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially provoked the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and a weapon, because every night we record a hundred attempts to (illegally) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor so that the Lukashenko regime and its Kremlin patrons would finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz assured Warsaw that it enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of refugees by the Lukashenko regime.
A drunk Polish nun caused an accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was being driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority to driving and driving away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She admitted that another nun had hit the vehicle and asked for her help.
The police came for Sister Celestine.
They gave her a breathalyzer test, and after finding out she had over two promiles in her blood, she was immediately stripped of her driver's license.
At the same time, she was told that she would be heard in court.
Hugo the dog does what he can.
Juraj Šajmovič, however, did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies have been seen in American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After the cheesy film F. Brabec Gump - the dog that taught people to live, now another film is competing for the audience emotions in cinemas.
The co-author of the screenplay and the director in one person Juraj Šajmovič Jr. freely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch 2012.
The talking dachshund Hugo and some familiar characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the Šumava pension, who are dying, begin to invite the dog owner, Julia's father and partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who is experiencing first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz Šajmovičová (who is also the producer of the film) had already struggled with the narrative in the previous dog movie, but at least children and a dog entertained there.
This time, the creative duo wrote an even weaker script that evokes a mixture of wonder and awkwardness.
Let's recap.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to obscurantist delusions in her desire for a child, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates just specify - on the hood of a car or church tower (of course during an ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired Colonel Mojmír, despite years of training, shoots his own daughter (Julia) in the woods.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pets.
The owners know why they have it.
But the viewer is amazed at what a content pelmel full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of thieves from the staff, a competition of dog owners, a Šumava charlatan, police officers coming to find “drugs” and discussing herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal - and which the baked family in the pension will of course get drunk.
When the heroine wakes up after a heavy coma and then sits down with a cigarette at the family table, demanding her father’s whiskey and loafing like a cured vegetarian, it is impossible not to laugh.
On top of that, the filmmaker explains to the viewer that “this sometimes happens after a coma.”
Šajmovic’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to build supporting situations, a sense of character and point, and directorial leadership.
The performances are uneven, the cut is clueless and the overall impression is spotty.
However Lukáš Vaculík, Jitka Ježková or Nela Boudová try to stand their party, they have little to play.
The only advantage of the film remains poetic shots of the Šumava countryside by cameraman Vladimír Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to outline a few characters, a flimsy plot and dog-like catchphrases, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters commit.
The argument is not even a long-term membership in the Dachshund Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
Behind good intentions to promote nature and friendship with a dog must also be knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This has failed in this case.
For a good family movie, there's a little too much eroticism and a minimum of feeling for the genre.
Even as an advertisement for canistherapy, this amateurishly conceived piece would not pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant abuse from jerks like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, you can see the shit you don't understand here, but that's just because you never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened to those kids all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It is a job like any other, in which case a part-time job.
The Middle East is suffering from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service said in a statement.
The village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel, for example, reports only 6% of the long-term rainfall average for November.
This week’s two-day rain was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a while.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, enjoyed by the residents of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Rainfall in Israel comes almost exclusively in the winter months, it is bumpy and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater resource, the Sea of Galilee, was filled to the brim this spring thanks to three last rainy winters.
The water's been dropping ever since.
Water managers have warned of droughts for a long time.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, precipitation may decrease here,” Uri Schor, a spokesman for the Israel Water Authority, said in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries like Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there are more and more tankers.
Water pipes and private wells are drying out.
“This year my orders have increased by 70-80% compared to the two previous years,” said Imad Suleiman, the driver of the tanker.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The riverbed was completely without water.
The region has had its driest November in many years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had not made “any progress” and that he had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli military to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, reports Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the U.S., has been trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but has also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said that the nuclear talks in Vienna had not brought "any progress" and world powers "understand that the Iranians are playing with them".
Three years ago this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little and grilled during the interview to find out what she really wants from me.
I finally found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Since I really don’t like these scams, I kept on asking questions and then thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm a punk, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and financial advisors are financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, they expected plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major onslaught of those interested in skiing this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow and some ski resorts have started operation.
The skier was not deterred by the obligation to prove himself at the lifts with a covid certificate.
While lift operators do not complain about customer indifference, some ski rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people went to cross-country trails and ski slopes over the weekend in the Liberec Region.
Skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, the opening weekend has really come out since Friday night skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanuš, director of the Ještěd Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people went to the Jeseníky Mountains for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the resort in Branná in the Šumperk region were open.
The weekend attendance was very good, there were an estimated 400 people on Saturday and today.
The terms are cool.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect ski resort representative in Branná Rostislav Procházka did not spare praise.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski passes to people who are vaccinated or are in the period after having covid-19 disease.
With few exceptions, people are prepared for this and present the necessary documents, René Hroneš from the Špindlerův Mlýn ski centre told the Czech News Agency.
“We only recorded units of incidents,” he added.
Less interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rentals and shops.
Fortunately, there is interest in renting skis.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Bokišová from Skiopava store in Opava.
He expects more stress in the period of ski courses.
David Šinták, CEO of the Hradec Králové company Snowbear, also feels that because of the covid, there is not as much interest in renting ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost on loan.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, Šinták told ČTK.
People became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the other hand, the rental in the Novako area at Boží Dar is in great demand.
They started renting skis there a week ago and those interested have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to lend out the runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Nováková, the area’s operator.
She said interest in the pre-epidemic period was comparable to that of a ski school.
If we want the successful and rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a doctor specialist.
Smart and smart people go abroad who have no assets here.
Business owners don’t just go abroad.
With the rest, I agree completely.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one fine day, ruling for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from one day to the next.
The next question is elections.
If it's a bad place to live, some traditional V4 freak could win.
The young and educated will leave, its supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Terrifying photo!
A Langmajer in the blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, the crew of the film Ostrov headed by Jiří Langmajer (55) enjoyed the tropical weather in Thailand!
The actor posted a picture of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up shoot?
Police in London are still searching for the missing woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left her job around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association, according to British media.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group said in a tweet.
"We would encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
MP Harriet Harmanová, who drew attention to Srncová’s case at a press conference on Saturday, also calls for cooperation.
“She has been missing for several days now, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are understandably worried to death,” she said, holding a photograph of the woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel that we all have a particularly big responsibility to try and find her because she was out of her home country, away from her family and working here for our health service,” Harman said.
Police have previously arrested a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I do not underestimate Ukraine.
These are not "huge quantities", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Notice that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and it is starting to get fed up with our entry.
I quoted above.
I don't know why you think Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy’s GDP.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is off at so many points that I don't even know where to start.
I can compare it to the First Punic War and the "anexy" of Sicily :D
I imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That's all there is to it, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
Ono, pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague’s integrated transport (PID) are expecting several changes from Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
The Mladá Boleslav region is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday stop express trains from České Budějovice in the station Zahradní Město.
In the suburban train service, there will be S7 trains running from Beroun to Český Brod through Prague’s main railway station.
The R17 express train from České Budějovice and Benešov will stop at the recently opened Praha-Zahradní Město station.
PID will now extend to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Světlá nad Sázavou, Blatno u Jesenice, Staré Splavy and Turnov.
Buses will be incorporated in the Mladá Boleslav region, including lines extending to the Liberec and Hradec Králové regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new lines will be introduced and 12 operational ones will be modified.
A new bus line 405 will start from Prague Zličín, which will go all the way to Žatec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovníka has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning rush hour and at the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when express line number 404 will be launched.
Newly, lines 400 and 410 going to the Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They leave from Střížkov metro station, not from Nádraží Holešovice station.
The backbone line 400 goes through Mělník, Duba and Česká Lípa to Nový Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 goes through Mělník and Dubá to Doksy, Mimoň and Jablonný in Podještědí.
On the other hand, traffic on ten Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dobříš or Rožmitál pod Třemšínem, has been cancelled or restricted.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague - Beroun, Prague - Lysa nad Labem and around Kolín.
Changes are also expected in other places.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or expand the section on the 420 line from Dobříš with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevsko.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in the Nymburk region have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border between Central Bohemia and Hořovice in the Plzeň Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch to the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a break of 30min and my only option is to get food next door to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don’t have any exercise, I don’t have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietary as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and I quickly buy pizza buns and snack yogurt and apple.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a metre of snow like you, unfortunately it is.
It’s not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying it's the only reason we're not allowed to go off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confessions Gifts about the relationship with Nedvěd: I did not look forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been alive with nothing but revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedvěd.
They’ve been dating for years, and the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent fans a comprehensive message explaining why she has been hiding her love from them for six months.
“I dare say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who has escaped that Dara has caught a bear, i.e., Nedvěd,” joked Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he picked her up, not the other way around.
Three days are the focus of attention, and although they are used to public interest, they are not happy about it.
Here we go.
What we both didn’t look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether those who do not care at all and jump on them and from the can, or we, whose lives they dissect in detail.
It’s as if one of you wanted to hear an opinion about whether you and your husband or girlfriend were good enough together, or you insisted that everyone really knew the list of your ex-partners and were familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, Dara.
The pair got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvěd has long served as vice president of the Juventus Football Club.
They've only come out with the truth now because they've been waiting for Nedvěd's divorce to be consummated.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they have only been married for three weeks.
For those of you who are happy and wish us well, thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have our hearts in the right place.
That’s why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him, for better or for worse.”
Hello, other commenters have probably already said everything essential, I just confirm that the dormitories are great to start with, my classmates usually met and befriended during the first semester or two and found lodgings together, which seems to me to be the best option, because you know who you will live with.
The apartments are usually not advertised very long in advance, so you probably won’t find much now, but looking at the offer certainly doesn’t hurt.
Otherwise, be sure to avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovská, Francouzská, etc., this is a pretty bad address), and some parts of Židenice are a bit ghetto.
On the other hand, Veveří district is a lot of student, Královo pole and that direction is fine, besides it is close to most BUT faculties (I don’t know where exactly you start).
So I never sought rent, but I am a native Brno, so I can eventually advise Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what several doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly fine that the state does not fund some schools sufficiently.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it, or they follow the state and the state pays for it.
After all, we can’t let a private actor dominate a piece of education just because he adds a few crowns to a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to that, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier had spoken in this way about the petition for a boycott of the totalitarian state:
So a vote against having an abortion is the same as a vote against having a statue in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced when cataloging / digitizing that (even long-time professionals) either somehow throw it away, or write something like xxx *** or ... (by convention) and note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I probably would not recommend it completely.
Personally, I would probably deal with it in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look into some character databases and find the one closest to you.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer simply created their own character that matches what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn’t it more the Odrysian Empire than the Odrysian Empire?
PS: Someone's already broken it for you.
Take a look at this comment by s.
Politicians do not even know what the "topic" of our presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having an interpreter with you.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is laughable.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter for lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, while English is more suitable for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relations.
The English language is very interesting after the UK’s departure from the EU.
I don't understand the Cejl hate.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I leave work at 10 p.m. and never have a problem?
That it's a ghetto can only be said by someone who's barely been there in his life.
Yeah, most of Brno's Romani population lives there, but the only thing they do is obstruct the pavement and park where they don't have to :D It's definitely not that I'm afraid to climb on the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
Many apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slováček (78) without Dáda and mistress Gelemová as a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, Felix Slováček did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
I saw a wreath and Lucie certainly has one too, said Bleska saxophonist, who so confirmed Patrasová’s words that she often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slovaks still don’t know where they’ll be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Anička, Felix and both grandsons.
VIDEO: Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together Again!
Felix Slováček and Lucie Gelemová: Together again!
But we kept talking, so Christmas didn't happen.
I really don't know where I'm gonna be.
I buy gifts continuously and I will definitely buy something, probably perfume.
I’m a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the launch of the music video for the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slováček, who was happy to meet his wife Luděk Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila Nývltová.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and guns?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
I don't see why that would be a bad argument, so explain it to me.
I don't know of any other file that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
The police are few and they cannot afford it, so the firefighters themselves and nowhere else have such a high percentage of health-trained people at that level.
And the fact that our army is only able to defend Ostrava goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, which has been begging for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape should not be just a factory for food, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is going through its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water levels have decreased in mountain and foothill areas, and smaller rainfall is also recorded in places where there has been no shortage of moisture.
The cause of the drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact is also compounded by the way we manage the land.
What can I do to prepare for drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's right, I can barely keep my skates on the ice, I know what it's like to play hockey, and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total haluz.
And whether you're a hockey team "Bears Russia" or "Lama China" so lose by two goals even if you do not have to win the match at any cost is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to Czech commentators who point out, what the judges are not noticing, whether men's or women's hockey, it's all weird, but that's about all sports, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho had it been the opposite as it is always the case, and that the Czech Republic has already lost to Russia more often than it has won, it would probably have been a classic "smell lost" vs. "WE have won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
There are 5,766 people in the hospital.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 1967 per 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" large wave of infections caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for the UK's Health Security Authority, told television on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
People infected with Omicron are already hospitalized in the UK, and Hopkins expects the number to grow.
So far, no one has died from Omicron, but hospitalizations occur about 14 days after the infection and deaths occur about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when lockdowns were introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister argued that the quiz took place “virtually” via a computer.
However, groups of employees gathered around computers attended in Downing Street.
In Britain, pressure is mounting to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, ITV's commercial television editor for Britain: Boris Johnson won the general election by an overwhelming majority two years ago today.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about removing him from the post of prime minister.
It’s amazing how quickly events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary faces elections in the spring that could end Viktor Orbán’s 12-year rule.
It will be an election of pan-European importance.
How much can you expect to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won’t be free either, because neither were the last two elections under Orbán.
His party, Fidesz, controls the media, changes the boundaries of electoral districts to profit from it, and does other tricks, bigger or smaller.
The last one is that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to bring voters from decided precincts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
I repeat, they are not fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
The question was not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by a united opposition.
This is a big deal for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power playing even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a recording leaked to independent media by the speaker of parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz, László Kuvér, has told intelligence chiefs that the opposition is a threat to national security.
Are these signs of the new approach you are talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't either, my dad has it for a long time, but then he bangs extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and angry as a little girl, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in cramps and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2 times to calm down.
Sometimes they hit my nursery, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things by force now, as a little girl I fought quite a bit, now I hit at least for something, and as a younger parent I slapped my parents over the hand (so that I did not get too much), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have that urge.
I can't say to what extent it's explosive, but I'm sure the upbringing has its share.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids, and I'm going to do the same.
I think that hitting children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn’t have done it, especially not at the moment when it wasn’t “educational” anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent will just screw something up, it’s probably not possible to at least give their children a little dirty talk, so I don’t blame them.
It doesn’t bother me, I don’t understand why he should be ashamed.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call cunts those that make laws of such quality.
I wonder if you're not afraid of a blackout?
Is it possible to really count on people wanting and buying the product and you will have to pay the mortgage?
The monster world of the coachman.
Where will Slovakia move the trial of Kuciak’s killers?
In Slovakia, the trial of four defendants in the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová begins.
The death of an investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It set civil society in motion, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marián Kočner and his connections to the top Slovak politics and justice.
How crucial will the process be for Slovakia?
Journalists are hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude more media attention than the counter-petition of the deans of all the medical schools that came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled, and the company bailed.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of the repository nowhere
Minister Karel Havlíček’s proposal needs a major overhaul
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš has come to an end and the law that was supposed to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens in selecting and authorising a deep repository of highly radioactive waste are respected still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has interrupted the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of delays.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against Deep Repository, but also with the Union of Towns and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect the law to significantly strengthen their options when deciding on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Act and the European Directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, to revise the proposal in cooperation with municipalities.
The proposal for a law from Minister Karel Havlíček, which the Platform has at its disposal, reproaches municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the selection of a site for a repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process continues at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to request the consent of the municipalities concerned before the commencement of a specific procedure.
The proposed objective proposal almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of municipalities practically mere statisticians during the permit procedures.
The design lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a site for storage, enabling it and operating it.
Indeed, according to today’s legal standards, representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures can they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the Office or the Minister in whose interest it is to issue the authorisation.
The potential action shall not have suspensive effect on the carrying out of the survey or construction work.
The co-decision of municipalities that the Platform calls for is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly in those where they have already made progress in permitting storage, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o. concluded by SÚRAO and following up on contracts with attorney Jan Zemánek.
According to the Register of Contracts, the total amount for these works is almost CZK 4 million.
Antonín Seknička, vice-mayor of the municipality of Cejle from the locality of Hrádek and spokesperson of the Platform Against Deep Repository, said: We expect a more significant turnaround from the new government after the ministers of industry straightening out the position of local governments towards state authorities in search of a deep repository of high-level radioactive waste.
We also offer a helping hand.
We would also like to thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a crucial construction in a similar way as directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Platform Against Deep Repository brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state’s approach to spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste management, which will not be limited to deep repository.
The platform further advocates that the decision to choose a site for possible storage be subject to the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman, 69, was scared to lose weight: He lost 90 kg.
Although he did not need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kg, reports The Sun.
He played his new character in Los Angeles during the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
Roseanne's fat sitcom is a whole different person!
John liked to joke that friends and family begged him to lose weight because his big body was causing furniture to crack.
"I put everything in my mouth," the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise.
I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still anymore,” Goodman told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" for.
If it's some kind of text on a platform that's expecting a reader from the game world, I wouldn't translate it at all.
If it was a formal or university text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are many types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, right, and so is the "boss" something like the master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who are not needed at all to beat the game or the level was completed, but often they are even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly interact with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called that at all?
And then there are the mini-bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in one word, Czech and other languages do not solve it (only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent, is interesting).
In short, it is significant for the story or game in general, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and watching to complete some level or task.
The world is searching for the missing Peter from London.
The Czech police were also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Peter Srnec since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old has been searching for the woman since December 7.
Interpol is also helping the British police.
The Czech Republic was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
Police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow memo.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokesperson Kateřina Rendlová confirmed.
“We share information about the case,” she added.
The announced search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such a disappearance is very unusual for her.
Local MP Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Petra.
She got involved in posting flyers with Petra's face on them.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
British police have arrested a suspect in connection with the disappearance.
It is not clear who he is and what he had in common with Peter.
The Czech Republic is terrorized by Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a slight decline in offensive campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, the attacks intensified significantly.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same.
An infected attachment in an email is meant to draw the user’s attention with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month a dangerous appendix had the word invoice in the title, this time it was marked as a copy of the repair receipt for 11,2021...exe," said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird, or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored credentials, which it then sends to attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the approaching holidays and the end of the year, the activity of attackers is growing again.
In November, spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with a global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook slightly weakened in November, but still stands at almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most commonly contained an attachment with the .exe extension REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account continues to appear.
An annex in Czech can then be much more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts have recorded a significant decrease in activity for the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and has had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in recent months.

The march through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
Based on the footage of the parade along the waterfront and my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
People in the procession filled the waterfront as well as the bridge and the opposite waterfront road.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by spontaneously joins the march of about 4,000 protesters.
Something new is being born here, writes Radek Mokrý.
That the persistent discontent of several large groups or strata of the population led to their finding common ground.
Only anti-vaxers, anti-haters and co. themselves would not be able to fill or pay for such a large procession.
The actions of the Dead Dog Association have an increasing popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy inside out.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It’s hard to say what kind of movement this discontent could bribing depends not only on the money supply, but also on whether Pfizer’s three-dose vaccine will become four or more.
It's not going to be a left-wing or center-wing movement, you bet.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multi-dose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I am very glad that vaccines have saved us.
A brilliant action by scientists that humanity is rightfully proud of.
The end of the stalemate, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing the change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has tasked Kiril Petkov with forming a new government from the anti-corruption movement We Continue Change, which won the November elections.
It has already formed a broad coalition government that is expected to take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
But the winning parties against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.

The “secret” footage is a global hit.
Over the weekend, there were growing concerns in Britain about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, who has been wanted by the London police for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago driving home from work to the south of the British capital.
In addition to the police, information about a child hospital worker is also called by her former employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her," Lucy O'Connor of Lambeth Police Department, where Srncova worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
She said the missing Czech woman left her job around 7:45 p.m. on Sunday and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncová worked as an "assistant nurse" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, part of the Guy's and St Thomas' hospital association, according to British media.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing," the group said in a tweet.
"We would encourage anyone who might have any information that could help find her to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zdeněk Dvořáková, an amateur painter of children’s rooms in Šumperk (and also a regional pirate councillor), reported anonymously that her paintings violate copyright.
However, the court acknowledged that the paintings of Mole in the Šumperk rooms do not violate the law.
In Ústí nad Labem there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the roadway, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole went further.
In the end, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, ŘSD began to “address the situation intensively”.
